00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 align:start position:0%

bill
 
00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
it's now your bill you're the subject
 
00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
matter experts
 
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
i submit it for your consideration
 
00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
this bill originated um from a
 
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
constituent and then several
 
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.629 align:start position:0%
constituent and then several
constituents

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
the reason for the bill is several of
 
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
these constituents had signed
 
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
non-compete agreements when they were
 
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.469 align:start position:0%
non-compete agreements when they were
hired

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
hired
 
00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:51.670 align:start position:0%
hired
the

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
compete agreement did not have any
 
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
contingencies about separation other
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
than if the employee left on their own
 
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.070 align:start position:0%
than if the employee left on their own
however

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
when an employee is terminated it turns
 
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
out they're still locked into this
 
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
non-compete agreement so what happened
 
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
was unfortunately all things apparently
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
go back to covet these days
 
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
they were given the choice take the vacs
 
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
or get terminated they chose not to
 
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
which is their right and the employers
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
are right
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
however the employee is still holding
 
00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
them to the non-compete agreement
 
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
so what that does is in effect it
 
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
sideslim sideslides them for an entire
 
00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
year with no ability to make money
 
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
income or continue they have a gap in
 
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
their resume
 
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
so i originally wrote the bill um
 
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
honestly not knowing what the heck i was
 
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
doing i just tried to figure out a way
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
to do it and i over complicated it
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
last night i um
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
discussed it ran it by my wife
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
as i often do and she's from atlanta and
 
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
after i got done reading it to her she
 
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
said oh sweetie bless your heart i knew
 
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
i was in trouble
 
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
um that's that's never a good thing from
 
00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
a southern woman here
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
she's a director of human resources at a
 
00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:01.759 align:start position:0%
billion dollar company
 
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
she knows what she's talking about she
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
said terry you over over thought that
 
00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
make it simple make it sweet so that's
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
what i did
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
this bill as amended if you will adopt
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment simply says if you are
 
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.150 align:start position:0%
the amendment simply says if you are
terminated

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
terminated
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
the non-compete becomes void unless the
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
employer wants to pay for your
 
00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
your um your time in other words when
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
you sign a non-compete agreement you
 
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
agree i'm not going to go to one of your
 
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
competitors and take my mind and my
 
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.550 align:start position:0%
competitors and take my mind and my
intellectual

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
intellectual
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
property that i've developed or my
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
skills or knowledge or my sales contacts
 
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
with me in her your company
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
which is legitimate i don't think we
 
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
should be getting involved in private
 
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
contracts unless it affects the public
 
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
in such a way
 
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
like this where it actually would freeze
 
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
a citizen
 
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
from making any more money in their
 
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.309 align:start position:0%
from making any more money in their
field

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
field
 
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
so for example a sales and this is one
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
of my constituents she's a salesperson
 
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759 align:start position:0%
does good business
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
her employee excuse me her employer
 
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
asked her fax she said no thank you they
 
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
said okay well
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
thanks for working for us keep in mind
 
00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
you can't work for a competitor well
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
that's all she knows that's her that's
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
her feel that's our expertise
 
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
so for an employer to be able to free
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
someone out of the employment market for
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
an entire year
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
is wrong no matter how you look at it
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's wrong
 
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.110 align:start position:0%
it's wrong
so

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
in the interest of the employer
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
there's a way for them to get out of
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
that if they want to buy that employee's
 
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
loyalty for that entire year
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
then they should continue to pay it
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
so the amendment as it's written says
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
if you're terminated
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
and they wish to hold you to the
 
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
non-compete agreement they have to
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
continue your pay and benefits for
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
whatever term the non-compete agreement
 
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.470 align:start position:0%
whatever term the non-compete agreement
was

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
so if you have a one-year non-compete
 
00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.430 align:start position:0%
so if you have a one-year non-compete
agreement

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
they can terminate you but for that year
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
they have to buy you
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
and buy you out and pay you as if you
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
were still working there
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
that's your health insurance
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
and your pay and compensation
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
or i also put in there that the parties
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
can renegotiate
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
the agreement so that the company could
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
say okay
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
we'll let you out of it we'll give you a
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
lump sum there's still the ability for
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
the private
 
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
renegotiation of the deal but at the end
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
of the day if the employer is not
 
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
interested in that
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
they have to pay it and if the employer
 
00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
refuses to do that
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
and the employee is forced to litigate
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
to get their money or their freedom i've
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
provided some teeth whereby if they
 
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
prevail in court they're entitled to up
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
to trouble damages and their attorney
 
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.150 align:start position:0%
to trouble damages and their attorney
fees

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.269 align:start position:0%
fees
um

00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
according to my
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
my better half an expert most companies
 
00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
will avoid that and they'll just buy the
 
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
employer employee out
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day no one should
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
be frozen by an agreement that they
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
entered into
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
that had no contemplation of something
 
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
like this happening to them so having
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
said that i'm open to questions thank
 
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.590 align:start position:0%
said that i'm open to questions thank
you

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
questions for the presenter
 
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.870 align:start position:0%
questions for the presenter
representative

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
presenting this bill i was wondering we
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
had um
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
a another bill
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
trying to deal with a very similar
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
subject in a slightly different way it
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
was hb 1089
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
sponsored by representative cofoult have
 
00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:33.430 align:start position:0%
sponsored by representative cofoult have
you

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
seen that bill i know i have not no but
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
if there's another bill out there i mean
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
whatever car drives i'll get into it
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:44.839 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:46.959 align:start position:0%
questions have a question representative
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
roy um
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
since i'm involved with non-competes in
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
my business
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
um it's a couple supreme court rulings
 
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire over the last five
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
years it pretty much
 
00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
made most
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
most egregious parts of non-competes
 
00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:04.550 align:start position:0%
most egregious parts of non-competes
illegal

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
you cannot as i think the judge stated
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
in his ruling
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
preclude someone from being able to work
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
yes you can say they can't go after the
 
00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:15.519 align:start position:0%
same clients yes you can say you can't
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
use their intellectual property yes you
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
can say
 
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
you can't take their trade secrets but
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
you can't stop someone from working
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
you can't say you can't work with an x
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
amount of miles or things like that so
 
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
i'm interested in
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
knowing a little more about individuals
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
and is it your intention
 
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.750 align:start position:0%
and is it your intention
that

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
if the employer doesn't buy someone out
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
that it's okay to go after their client
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
base utilize their intellectual property
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh utilize
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
prior sales leads or or things like that
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
because not competes have a lot of stuff
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
in it absolutely not that you just can't
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
work absolutely they do
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
and the intent of the bill is solely
 
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:01.519 align:start position:0%
the employment piece intellectual
 
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
property remains intellectual property
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
and i believe there's even u.s supreme
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
court cases that deal with that um so no
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
this this would not be and if it looks
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
that way please let's amend it i do not
 
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
want this to make it so that employees
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
can steal
 
00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:19.839 align:start position:0%
um intellectual property or anything
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
client bases that they developed through
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
their employer or part of their
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
employment it's simply the work part now
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
as you said there are some supreme court
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
cases from new hampshire but they didn't
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
deal with termination or involuntary
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
separation to the best of my knowledge
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
they dealt with people leaving on their
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
own trying to get work somewhere else so
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
my sole goal in this is so that
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
people who are terminated for cause
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
and regardless of the reason the cause
 
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be coveted
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
should not be frozen out of work for a
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
year and so far the court hasn't
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
addressed that issue so if we need to
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
fine-tune this i i'm happy to do that i
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
think that's a good idea to specify
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
ip and things of that nature don't it's
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
about the employment itself that they
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
can work and even if it is for a
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
competitor because
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
that is their area of expertise if
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
someone works
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
pardon the frogs in my throat if someone
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
works in sales with a particular product
 
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.110 align:start position:0%
works in sales with a particular product
area

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
to tell them well you can still work in
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
sales but you got to go learn this whole
 
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
new product area and develop your i mean
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
it's it's not fair for someone who's
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
spent their career building that wealth
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
of knowledge as long as they're not
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
taking the knowledge that was the
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
property of their previous employer
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
would these
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
cases of individuals who were terminated
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
for refusal to
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
be vaccinated
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
have were they involved with the
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
healthcare industry
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
no they were sales um nothing to do with
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
healthcare one of them was i believe
 
00:13:54.079 --> 00:13:55.030 align:start position:0%
healthcare one of them was i believe
actually

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
um beauty products um
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't healthcare
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%

that we've noticed here at the
 
00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:54.949 align:start position:0%
that we've noticed here at the
department

00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
there's two things mainly that i did
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
want to note the first is that the bill
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
does define what a critical shortage is
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
but the bill does not appear to define
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
what it is when a job or skill set is in
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
high demand so the bill does not appear
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
to give the department any guidance
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
when we would make a finding or how we
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
would make a defining as to when that is
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
in high demand
 
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
it's very straightforward as to how we
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
would find something
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
is in critical shortage but we don't
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
seem to know
 
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
how we would make that finding and it
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
seems a straightforward fix would be to
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
simply say
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
if there is a critical shortage then it
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
is in high demand it would stop any
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
discretion on our part it would be a
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
simple and straightforward mechanism for
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
the second thing that we noticed is also
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
along the lines of discretion it's the
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
statute says that the com the
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner may suspend non-competes in
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
such a situation
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
and again it's not clear to us when or
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
how that discretion is expected to be
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
utilized what the standard would be for
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
the commissioner in terms of deciding
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
when to utilize that discretion and when
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
to suspend those non-competes
 
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
and again it's up to the committee and
 
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
it's up to the legislature in
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
determining how it wants to give that
 
00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:11.839 align:start position:0%
discretion but it may make sense to
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
again say if there is a critical
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
shortage and if there is a high demand
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
for that skill set to simply suspend
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
those non-competes for a period of time
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
if there is the desire to give the
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
department of labor some discretion
 
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
then imposing a standard on the
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner and how that discretion is
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
utilized might make some sense because
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
right now the way the bill is written
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
it just sort of says or it reads that
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
the commissioner may suspend and it
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
gives the commissioner discretion and
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
defining how it may suspend and in how
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
it finds whether the
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
job or skill set is in high demand so
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
those are the points of clarification if
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
this bill were to go forward that the
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
department would like to be clarified or
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
might be helpful to clarify going
 
00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:53.670 align:start position:0%
might be helpful to clarify going
forward

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
um other than that we take no position
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
on the bill ultimately
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions if
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
there are any for the department
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh mr mcnamara i'm not sure if you heard
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the
 
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.390 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the
hearing

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
um representative roy has had a complete
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
rewrite of his bill an amendment i know
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
you were referring to what's in front of
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
you and i respect that we'll try to get
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
you that
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
copy as soon as possible so you can
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
opine va uh maybe on via email uh once
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
you get that and see the
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
the perspective changes uh that being
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
easy one for you thank you very much
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
mr juve has not put a pink card in but
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
i'm making them come up anyway
 
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:42.230 align:start position:0%
i'm making them come up anyway
okay

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
five years ago when representative keith
 
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.590 align:start position:0%
five years ago when representative keith
murphy

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
murphy
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
in this committee submitted something
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
that um you must have a non-com if you
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
have a non-compete you must present it
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
to the employer before you hire them
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
um you brought me in front of your hr
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
committee and i got raked over the coals
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
for that by the bill
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
which was seems pretty
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
pretty minor now so
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
i knew you probably had something to say
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
how's that uh for the record my name is
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
dave giuve i'm a senior vice president
 
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
with the business and industry
 
00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.789 align:start position:0%
with the business and industry
association

00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
and uh for those of you that i know on
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
on a more personal level i am pleased to
 
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
say i'm no longer interim president we
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
have a new president at the bia so
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
that's a responsibility i'm happy to be
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
free from
 
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.029 align:start position:0%
free from
um

00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
miss chair i'm glad you clarified um
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
what is happening right now because i
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
was sitting in the back looking at 363
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
going this this seems
 
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.710 align:start position:0%
going this this seems
uh

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
it seems like we're talking about a
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
different bill so i will quickly adjust
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
and i remember that situation five years
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
ago i do not remember you being raked
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
over the coals my memory is we treated
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
you very respectfully no you did you did
 
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.430 align:start position:0%
you very respectfully no you did you did
i'm

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
having some fun with you david yes you
 
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.669 align:start position:0%
having some fun with you david yes you
did

00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
um i haven't seen the amendment but i
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
was able to hear the prime sponsors
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
explanation and just a couple of
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
concerns i would like to share with the
 
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.950 align:start position:0%
concerns i would like to share with the
committee

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
the first is there are
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
many companies in new hampshire and
 
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.630 align:start position:0%
many companies in new hampshire and
there

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
is a potential for more many
 
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
many other companies to be added to this
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
list that are under a federal vaccine
 
00:19:24.799 --> 00:19:25.909 align:start position:0%
list that are under a federal vaccine
mandate

00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
any employer that is receiving medicaid
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh or i think medicare money
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
is required to have a uh their employees
 
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and there are exemptions that
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
are provided for uh religious
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
beliefs or medical reasons but
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
nonetheless the employer is required to
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
implement that mandate so there's
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
really no flexibility on their part in
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
terms of an employee who
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
chooses that they want to
 
00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.070 align:start position:0%
chooses that they want to
leave

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
leave
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
secondly in
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
hearing the description of the amendment
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
it occurs to me that it it would require
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
this one essentially one year severance
 
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.070 align:start position:0%
this one essentially one year severance
for

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
um termination but there are many
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
reasons that employees may be terminated
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
because of their own behavior
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
they could be
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
having repeated uh work-related
 
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
infractions they could be threatening uh
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
other employees they could be stealing
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
from the company
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
the list is endless so it seems
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to require a company to
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
pay them
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
essentially for a year of work when
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
they've been terminated for cause
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
and then the third
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
thing i would like to remind you and the
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
chair already did a great job of this
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
this whole issue of non-competes was
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
discussed thoroughly in this committee
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
and in the house and senate and i think
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
a um
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
it was resolved in a way that was both
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
fair to employers and employees so
 
00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.029 align:start position:0%
fair to employers and employees so
this

00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
at the very least would upset a system
 
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
that it seems to be working for
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
everybody so mr chair would be happy to
 
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative vlog
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
you mr chair uh would you believe that
 
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
people have been fired over facebook
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
posts and put with political views
 
00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:28.630 align:start position:0%
posts and put with political views
i

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm willing to believe it i'm
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
not aware of that uh
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
in my own experience but would you
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
believe that employers now are so
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
strapped for employees that they are
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
almost doing anything other than
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
terminating people because they're
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
having a hard enough time finding uh
 
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
people to fill vacant positions without
 
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
adding to that problem
 
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
oh miss chip i believe both of you
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
um uh would you believe that's going to
 
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.390 align:start position:0%
um uh would you believe that's going to
end

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
end
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
um you know we're going to get past that
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
um i i i do know people that have been
 
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
fired over their
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
their facebook posts
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
then uh you know
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
fired for cause terminated for cause
 
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
okay you know but when when an employer
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
is allowed to do that um you know and
 
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
then enforce a non-compete agreement uh
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
i have a real problem with that
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
presidential cahill and followed by
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
seaworth maybe
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr juve
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
wrong but is not new hampshire an at
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
technically yes although uh as you and i
 
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
both know there are
 
00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.789 align:start position:0%
both know there are
um

00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
occasions or exceptions to that but in
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
general yes it is an at-will state
 
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
robert seaworth thank you mr chairman
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony and i'd
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
like to draw on your expertise if you if
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
you can help us
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
now you're making me nervous
 
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.310 align:start position:0%
now you're making me nervous
so

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.350 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
during the presentation the chairman
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
brought up well i'm i'm referring to
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
your comment about how the law seems to
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
have settled into a good balance right
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
now the chairman brought up an issue
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
that i have some concern about that
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
there are supreme court cases that
 
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.390 align:start position:0%
there are supreme court cases that
dictate

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
dictate
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
that that limit non-compete agreements
 
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
that are not reflected in the law so i'm
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's a gap between what
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
the courts would do if it went to court
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
and what the department of labor is
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
allowed to do based on the written law
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
any comments on that certainly thanks
 
00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
for the question um i should make sure
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
everyone clearly understands i am not a
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
lawyer and i'm especially not an
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
employment law
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
lawyer although we have many
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
of those within our membership whose
 
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
if that is the case and it seems
 
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable that it might be i might
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
suggest rather than going through with
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
this you might want to consider
 
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.909 align:start position:0%
this you might want to consider
forming

00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
forming
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
whether you do it statutorily or not
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
forming a group to look at
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
the state of current non-compete
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
statutes and the impact of of state or
 
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
federal supreme court decisions and see
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
if there is some type of remedy that
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
that is needed
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
and we would be happy to participate in
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.230 align:start position:0%
that thank you
representable

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
representable
 
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you for
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
would you
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
or your organization say that
 
00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:48.470 align:start position:0%
or your organization say that
the

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
right of an employer
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
to negotiate with an employee for a
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
non-compete clause
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
is an important and valuable right
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
that that company has
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
yes i i would say for for
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
some comp i think we can all agree that
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
most companies in the state don't have
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
non-competes but some do and for them it
 
00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.470 align:start position:0%
non-competes but some do and for them it
is

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%

good question all right if i could have
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
everyone's attention where
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
we've still got a few seconds before the
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
hearing starts
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
before we open the next public hearing
 
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.070 align:start position:0%
before we open the next public hearing
um

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
i was
 
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
some questions came up about what's on
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
the schedule for executive session later
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
the chairman did send out an email on
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
february 4th
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
some of us may have read and forgotten
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
some of us may have have missed that so
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
i wanted to read down the the bill
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
numbers that were in that email just so
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
everybody has that and can get i think
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
ahead he did remind us that he may add
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
others he may take them off as
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
circumstances dictate but here is the
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
list that he sent
 
00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:48.830 align:start position:0%
list that he sent
hb

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
hb
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
1053 hb
 
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.750 align:start position:0%
1053 hb
1076

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
1076
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
and i won't say hb every time
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
one zero nine four
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
one one two four
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
one two five one
 
00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.669 align:start position:0%
one two five one
1358

00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
1358
 
00:31:07.679 --> 00:31:10.549 align:start position:0%
1358
1363

00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
1363
 
00:31:10.559 --> 00:31:13.590 align:start position:0%
1363
1415

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:19.350 align:start position:0%
 
1472

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
all right and with that i made us a bit
 
00:31:22.399 --> 00:31:24.149 align:start position:0%
all right and with that i made us a bit
late

00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
late
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
so uh that
 
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
the chairman's mother doesn't give me a
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
call i will get us started here
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
and we have
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
representative mark allegro the prime
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and good
 
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
my name is mark allegro as was just
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
stated i'm the representative from
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
comprised of campton the town of campton
 
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
i'm here
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
i sit on the edna committee
 
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
and i hear very frequently when people
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
come up to testify this is a simple bill
 
00:32:04.559 --> 00:32:05.909 align:start position:0%
come up to testify this is a simple bill
and

00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry but i'm going to lay that one
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
on you here now this truth this truly is
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
a simple bill and i'm just going to
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
talk in two little uh clusters here
 
00:32:16.159 --> 00:32:17.669 align:start position:0%
talk in two little uh clusters here
um

00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not here to debate
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
or really even to make a point of
 
00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:22.789 align:start position:0%
or really even to make a point of
the

00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:22.799 --> 00:32:24.149 align:start position:0%
the
efficacy

00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
efficacy
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
or the safety of the vaccines
 
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
or even whether they should be called
 
00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.029 align:start position:0%
or even whether they should be called
vaccines

00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
00:32:31.039 --> 00:32:31.909 align:start position:0%
vaccines
but

00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
it's critical that the people on this
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
committee and the public understand
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
some facts about it in order for me to
 
00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.149 align:start position:0%
some facts about it in order for me to
exp

00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
exp
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
in order for me to turn off my phone
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
which i didn't silence
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
many of you are familiar with the
 
00:32:51.039 --> 00:32:52.710 align:start position:0%
many of you are familiar with the
cdc

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
cdc
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
and fda vers
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
um it is under the auspices of the
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
the us department of health and human
 
00:33:01.519 --> 00:33:03.190 align:start position:0%
the us department of health and human
services

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
the the acronym vares
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
stands for vaccine adverse effects
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.919 --> 00:33:13.269 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
the point here is that people are losing
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
their jobs
 
00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:18.310 align:start position:0%
their jobs
for

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
requesting exemptions to vaccination
 
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.789 align:start position:0%
requesting exemptions to vaccination
and

00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
i want to explain to you
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
the efficacy the dangers
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
and the reason why these people may be
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
hesitant to be vaccinated
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
again this is from the vaccine adverse
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
effects reporting system this is the
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
national institutes of health
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
cdc and fda
 
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
when we get through with this some of
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
you may choose
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
to not believe it but here are the
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
scientific facts
 
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
from the years
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
there have been 137 deaths
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
related to vaccine administration
 
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
for all current vaccines put together
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
okay that's an average of little over
 
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
four per year this is in the state of
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
in 2021 we started administering the
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
covet vaccines
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
for that one year alone
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
there were 64 deaths in the state of new
 
00:34:24.879 --> 00:34:26.149 align:start position:0%
there were 64 deaths in the state of new
hampshire

00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
that's 16 times
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
more deaths
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's more deaths
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
than all other vaccines combined
 
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:39.919 align:start position:0%
or i should say it's it's it's on the
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
order of the number of deaths for all
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
vaccines combined for 31 years
 
00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:46.839 align:start position:0%
just that one
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine feel free to interrupt me if you
 
00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
that doesn't count
 
00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations permanent disabilities
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
other injuries like miscarriages
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
or even what
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
some physicians are telling patients are
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
normal reactions
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
lymph nodes swollen up to the size of
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
golf balls
 
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.349 align:start position:0%
golf balls
okay

00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
um i have a little bit of background in
 
00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.230 align:start position:0%
um i have a little bit of background in
immunology

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
immunology
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to tell you that when your
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
lymph nodes swell up to the size of golf
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
balls or you land in the hospital for
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
some other reason
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's not a normal response to a
 
00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.349 align:start position:0%
that's not a normal response to a
vaccination

00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
you know the counter argument to all of
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
this is that well
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
compared to the number of deaths that
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
there might have been
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
if these people weren't vaccinated it's
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
a small number and that's true
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
and here's where i'm going to wrap up
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
the discussion of this data
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
that's akin to asking somebody to play
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
russian roulette
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
you put in a bullet you spin the chamber
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
you hold the gun to your head and you
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
pull the trigger
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
chances are not big that you're going to
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
blow your brains out
 
00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.230 align:start position:0%
blow your brains out
okay

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:02.950 align:start position:0%
okay
but

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
is there anybody in here who wants to
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
play russian roulette is there anybody
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
here in this building who would like to
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
be forced to play russian roulette
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
i can answer that question we can each
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
answer it for ourselves
 
00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.630 align:start position:0%
answer it for ourselves
so

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
the rest of what i have today is
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
relatively uh brief we last year at
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
about this time maybe eight nine months
 
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.870 align:start position:0%
about this time maybe eight nine months
ago

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
we had a big debate about
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
vaccines and employment
 
00:36:31.119 --> 00:36:31.990 align:start position:0%
vaccines and employment
and

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
it was a common um
 
00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.510 align:start position:0%
it was a common um
point

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
made by
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
our friends on both sides of the aisle
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
that we can't be telling businesses what
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
they have to take responsibility they
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
have to make their own decisions there's
 
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
a great deal of merit
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
but i also would put to you that
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
in addition to the power to make their
 
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
own decisions
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of making their own
 
00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.310 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of making their own
decisions

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
includes not throwing an
 
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
another tax burden on the people of new
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
you can't take a vaccine
 
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
because you've had a heart attack you
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
don't feel safe doing it or you have a
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
religious uh exemption request or you
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
just don't want to
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
when i would like this bill to say
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
to businesses is
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
it's your decision if you want to
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
release that person
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
it's your decision
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
but it's also your responsibility
 
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
so now 100 i've been in touch with our
 
00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:39.430 align:start position:0%
so now 100 i've been in touch with our
[Music]

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
department of employment security made
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
sure that some of these things that i'm
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
saying because i'm no employment expert
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
100 of unemployment insurance is paid by
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
the employer the trouble is is that
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
these people who were released because
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to or couldn't take a
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
vaccine or had
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
natural immunity is that they don't
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
receive unemployment insurance
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
proposes that employers who choose to
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
release employees for that reason
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
make available a severance package
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
for these employees
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
well why never mind the misery and truly
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
inhumanity of dumping somebody without a
 
00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.550 align:start position:0%
inhumanity of dumping somebody without a
job

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
job
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
in this market today where
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
many businesses choose not to hire you
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
if you're not vaccinated
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
but in addition to that
 
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers often pick up the tab
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
on other benefits programs like
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
food support supplemental nutrition
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
support and so on and so forth
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
in addition there's a cost to all
 
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.550 align:start position:0%
in addition there's a cost to all
taxpayers

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
at the federal level which includes we
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens
 
00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
for instance the administration of
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
unemployment uh of of the unemployment
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
program paid by excuse me if i don't
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
know how to pronounce the acronym i'll
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
spell it out futa it's the federal
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
unemployment tax
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
pays for the administration of
 
00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
unemployment uh benefits in the
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
individual states if there's more
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
unemployment there's a higher cost in
 
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
administering it
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
folks that's coming out of your pocket
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
and my pocket
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
and the pockets of other people across
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
the country just as our new hampshire
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
just as we're paying a federal tax here
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
for people in california
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
to administer these programs
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
i pointed out that taxpayers often pick
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
up the tab on food stamps and other
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
benefits programs in addition
 
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
the cost to all taxpayers federal
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers which includes
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
we new hampshire taxpayers
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
can be increased due to the well is
 
00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.390 align:start position:0%
can be increased due to the well is
increased

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
increased
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
for instance the federal government pays
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment under specific programs
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
such as the trade act
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
i don't have to repeat that the federal
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
government doesn't have money
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
the money comes out of our pockets the
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and the feds can pay up to
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
fifty percent of extended benefits
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
during high unemployment
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
so here's the deal in a nutshell
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
businesses should
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
there's a great deal of merit in the
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
argument that businesses should have the
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
ability to release employees
 
00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.270 align:start position:0%
ability to release employees
who

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to or cannot for whatever
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
reason are not vaccinated
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
but at the same time uh to cut them
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
loose in the sea of unemployment with no
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
support and foist some of that cost on
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
we the taxpayers is wrong this is a
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
simple solution
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
it says businesses go ahead and fire
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
them but you're gonna have to take the
 
00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.630 align:start position:0%
them but you're gonna have to take the
responsibility

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
off of the taxpayers shoulders you're
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
gonna have to provide a a severance
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
package it can be viewed as a severance
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
severance package for six months
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
up to two-thirds of the employees
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
compensation package
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
and we've all taken responsibility for
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
our own actions
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
the employee
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
the employer
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
and most importantly the new hampshire
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%

the last hearing is that
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
one category of employees that
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%

our other job back in the county
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%

um those folks have to be vaccinated or
 
00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
they have to
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
um be terminated
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
um you expressed a lot of legitimate
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
concern about
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
placing a burden on taxpayers
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
our county
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
nursing homes are paid for by tax
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
dollars and if we have
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
pay compensation um that comes from tax
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh tax dollars in the county uh how do
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
you respond to that yeah you're right
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
and that's a good point and thank you
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
and if i were going to request or
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
suggest an amendment for that i would
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
make provision for government entities
 
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.390 align:start position:0%
make provision for government entities
um

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
well for
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
for health care
 
00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.270 align:start position:0%
for health care
government

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
owned government-run healthcare entities
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
if it's a private health care facility
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
then i think it should fall under this
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
same the provisions of this bill
 
00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
but if it's a government entity
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
then it should uh
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
the provision should reflect current law
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
which says that healthcare
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
help government-run healthcare industry
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
if i were going to ask or um
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
ask for or
 
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
you know be highly pleased with such a
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
i would point out
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
um how flush our general fund is right
 
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
now in our rainy day fund
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
and how highly available federal funds
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
are and i would suggest that some
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
provision be made for these employees as
 
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.550 align:start position:0%
provision be made for these employees as
well

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:02.560 align:start position:0%

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:04.960 align:start position:0%

punish employees or have anybody benefit
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh unnecessarily
 
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
somebody comes out
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
finds a job two weeks later
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
well the severance package is no longer
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
in order
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
did i answer the question is that
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
first part is right so who would monitor
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
that the employee is no longer working
 
00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
would it be the former employer would it
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
be employment services would it be dol
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
would it be the actual employee
 
00:45:30.079 --> 00:45:31.510 align:start position:0%
would it be the actual employee
um

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
well if i were paying
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
the fee
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
i would be monitoring it
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh actually another um
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
aspect of this bill which i did not
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
discuss is the idea that
 
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
the employees need to file with the
 
00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.510 align:start position:0%
the employees need to file with the
state

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
a um
 
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
you know a plan and a policy
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
and that policy
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
could mesh with uh monitoring
 
00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.309 align:start position:0%
could mesh with uh monitoring
employees

00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
built into the severance program
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
that the company puts out as their
 
00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.550 align:start position:0%
that the company puts out as their
policy

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
could be a bi-weekly or monthly
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
report from the employee
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
confirming that they have not found
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
additional employment
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
very much like our unemployment system
 
00:46:11.599 --> 00:46:13.750 align:start position:0%
very much like our unemployment system
now

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
i mean yeah and this the state as well
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
could monitor this just as our current
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
unemployment system is handled thank you
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative warden thank you thank
 
00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.430 align:start position:0%
representative warden thank you thank
you

00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
my questions regarding the uh two-thirds
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
of the salary
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
and benefits received but a lot of
 
00:46:34.319 --> 00:46:35.190 align:start position:0%
and benefits received but a lot of
people

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
that are in sales receive bonuses and
 
00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.710 align:start position:0%
that are in sales receive bonuses and
commissions

00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
and the way this was written it's my
 
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
understanding that those would not be
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
included because it only refers to
 
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
salary is that your intention
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
well that's correct um
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
you can't account for
 
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
bonuses and um and
 
00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:54.470 align:start position:0%
bonuses and um and
commissions

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
this uh plan as it's written
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
somewhat more generous than our regular
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
unemployment system
 
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
which provides a maximum of i think 430
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
or so uh for unemployed individuals for
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
up to six months
 
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
this uh provides something closer to
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
reality for that employee
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
so uh yes it's entirely possible
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh that they're not making their
 
00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.470 align:start position:0%
uh that they're not making their
commissions

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
but it's something to put food on the
 
00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:31.990 align:start position:0%
but it's something to put food on the
table

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
would you say that
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
the policy
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
statements that you're looking for here
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
a policy
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
in your opinion is that something that a
 
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
private business
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
would develop on its own
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
yes because this isn't state law that
 
00:47:57.359 --> 00:47:58.549 align:start position:0%
yes because this isn't state law that
they're

00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
they're uh developing policy on this is
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
company law
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh and the only difference is that we
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
want this
 
00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:06.870 align:start position:0%
want this
policy

00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
to be available to the employee
 
00:48:09.359 --> 00:48:11.349 align:start position:0%
to be available to the employee
and

00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
as well as to potential employees of
 
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
that company
 
00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.109 align:start position:0%
that company
so

00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
this isn't uh the situation is not that
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
the state is going to approve policy
 
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
but it's going to be on file and
 
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
available as a public record
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
did i address the central issue
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
follow-up um
 
00:48:35.839 --> 00:48:37.109 align:start position:0%
follow-up um
yes

00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
the second part of that question though
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
goes to
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
since this would apply to private
 
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.750 align:start position:0%
since this would apply to private
employers

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
employers
 
00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:44.870 align:start position:0%
employers
and

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
as we on this committee have said and
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
you in your opening remarks have said we
 
00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
tend to not get in between
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
the private business and their employees
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
on line seven where it talks it says the
 
00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:02.079 align:start position:0%
policy at a minimum shell and then it
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
goes on to in what term i would use
 
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
would dictate three
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
specific items that
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
the employer must include
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
would it
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
my interpretation of that is that we're
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
dictating policy to
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
a private business would that be your
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
intention well um
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
we do that all the time although we all
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
like to run around and say that we don't
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
interfere with
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
with private businesses we do we require
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh policies and plans regarding uh
 
00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
occupational safety and health to be
 
00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:40.950 align:start position:0%
occupational safety and health to be
filed

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
filed
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
of all businesses
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
so uh i'm looking at the wording here uh
 
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
the policy at a minimum so it's up to
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
the uh corporation or the company uh the
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
business permitted employee to opt out
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
of the medical mandate well that's the
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
whole central issue here that's they're
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
already allowed to do that
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
permit an employer to terminate an
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
employee that's what we're claiming is
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
their right
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
but then to require that employer to put
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
on record
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
their policies in making such decisions
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
in other words if one person comes with
 
00:50:13.599 --> 00:50:15.109 align:start position:0%
in other words if one person comes with
a

00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
it has to be clear why they can say
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
no to that employee
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
and yes to this employee
 
00:50:26.079 --> 00:50:26.470 align:start position:0%
and yes to this employee
so

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.309 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
telling businesses what to do is what we
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
do here in the legislature
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay it's what we do
 
00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
360 days a year so i did point out that
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
this was part of the debate 10 months
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
ago but i'm not saying that i'm on board
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
we tell businesses what to do all the
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
time and we just came off of a two-year
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
period of telling businesses what to do
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
at an unprecedented level
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
so asking them to file you know this
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
this would be how
 
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
how i would say it asking them to file a
 
00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:04.630 align:start position:0%
how i would say it asking them to file a
policy

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
that could be made available to
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
employees potential employees and
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
it's a minor thing i think
 
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
please do one more follow-up
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
just to be clear i'm not unsympathetic
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
to where you're trying to go with this
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying the way that it's
 
00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:28.309 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying the way that it's
written

00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
actually that does go and dictate
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
specific things that would apply to a
 
00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
private employer the other comment that
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
i will make
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
so you're aware of w we in this
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
committee have seen multiple bills that
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
are all kind of
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
overlapping like this and i would say
 
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
this might fall
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
partially into that just just for your
 
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
information is that a question
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's great i gotta remember that
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
so yeah may i just comment uh to that or
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
answer that question
 
00:52:01.839 --> 00:52:03.670 align:start position:0%
answer that question
um

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i i just wanted to set the record
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
straight that uh
 
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
um i don't think it's a powerful
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
argument that
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be telling businesses what
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.549 align:start position:0%
to do
um

00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
or rather
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
it is a powerful argument except that we
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
here in state government really don't
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
adhere to it at all
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
so this is a uh
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
i know some of us more than others uh
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
this is a case where um
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
i think that the uh the rights of the
 
00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:34.150 align:start position:0%
i think that the uh the rights of the
individual

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
have to be placed somewhere up there
 
00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
with the rights of the businesses
 
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
that's that that has been the counter
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
argument too
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
to what we're discussing
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
further questions and i'll come back to
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
representative avaloni after giving
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative love a chance
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thanks for taking my
 
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
you know there's uh
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions you know have come up
 
00:52:59.910 --> 00:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh you won't get an argument out of me
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
as far as the uh the safety of this
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
vaccine i've got family members that
 
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
have been injured by it friends that
 
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
have been injured by it and um
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
you know there's no recourse
 
00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:11.349 align:start position:0%
you know there's no recourse
um

00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh one thing i would like to ask is that
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
would you be uh
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay with an amendment uh and it did i
 
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
think it would cover a lot of these
 
00:53:20.549 --> 00:53:20.559 align:start position:0%
bills that uh you know that were getting
 
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
hit in every direction with them
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
to relieve the company of any liability
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
from an employee coming in saying i
 
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
caught covet here and i'm suing you
 
00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:31.990 align:start position:0%
caught covet here and i'm suing you
and

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
on the other hand
 
00:53:33.359 --> 00:53:35.270 align:start position:0%
on the other hand
okay

00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:37.109 --> 00:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
give the liability to the company if
 
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:38.559 align:start position:0%
somebody is in
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
is injured by a mandated vaccine
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
you know whether it's 5 10 years down
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
the road if it can be proven that any
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine i'm talking um you know if you
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
mandate it if you force your employee to
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
get it
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
you're liable
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
would you be
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
would you be okay with an amendment
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
i would be in amongst um
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
the bills that uh
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte was speaking of
 
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
i know i don't know if it has
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
persisted or if it was withdrawn but
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
i know there was one house bill that
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
addressed the issue of uh injury due to
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
mandated vaccine
 
00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:13.750 align:start position:0%
mandated vaccine
um

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:14.549 align:start position:0%
um
if

00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
this bill now belongs to the committee
 
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
and if this committee uh wanted to put
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
that in i'd be delighted let me address
 
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
the other uh side of that coin
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
um an employee um
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
this is my bailiwick
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to tell you in spite of all
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
the contact tracing and all of this
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
other business
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna say this strongly there is
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely and utterly
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
no way
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
to tell where and when someone caught
 
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
the bug this is just scientific fact
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
all the contact racing in the world
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
there are times when you could tell when
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
it's highly unlikely that a person
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh caught the bug at a given event or
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
place because there's a natural
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
incubation period but even those very
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
fuzzy borders
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
so normally
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
one to four days later
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
if you've been exposed you might start
 
00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
coming down with symptoms
 
00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:14.430 align:start position:0%
but that can stretch out to
 
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:15.670 align:start position:0%
but that can stretch out to
[Music]

00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
days or weeks
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
so it
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
is completely and utterly impossible
 
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
to tell where and when someone caught
 
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
the bug
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
on the other hand
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
and three days later uh collapses and is
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
carted off to the hospital you know we
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
see it in the news occasionally
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
this because it's a celebrity you know
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
this celebrity died eric clapton
 
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
couldn't play his guitar for months uh
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
within days after taking the vaccine the
 
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
burden of proof will still need to
 
00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.190 align:start position:0%
burden of proof will still need to
remain

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
remain
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
with the person filing the complaint
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
the bill is now the committees i would
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
support and be very pleased to see a
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
provision like that put in as an
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative vavlani
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
representative again
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
line five and employer
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
are you talking every employer that has
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
one employee or a thousand employees
 
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
just so we're clear every employer
 
00:56:19.599 --> 00:56:20.870 align:start position:0%
just so we're clear every employer
so

00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
chairman so if a mom and pop as it was a
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
sync with a single employee lays you
 
00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:28.839 align:start position:0%
know requires a
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
vaccination because there might be
 
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
compromise they're you know and they
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
want their employee to be
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
not as much of a risk so the single mom
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
and pop would be on the hook for six
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
months of severance prank yeah
 
00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:48.559 align:start position:0%
this is an opportunity
 
00:56:50.789 --> 00:56:50.799 align:start position:0%
for citizens and neighbors to work out
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
problems amongst themselves
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh and they can
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
tell somebody look you know
 
00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.950 align:start position:0%
tell somebody look you know
oh

00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
we're not gonna mandate you to wear a
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
mask or we're not gonna mandate you to
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
keep six feet away or we're gonna change
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
your duties a little bit i hope this is
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay with you
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
let them come to a uh an agreement
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
between employee and employer but
 
00:57:12.799 --> 00:57:14.150 align:start position:0%
between employee and employer but
yes

00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
this is an employer
 
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
yes their responsibility is the same to
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
their employee just as if they had 30
 
00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:23.109 align:start position:0%
their employee just as if they had 30
employees

00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative warden
 
00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
brought up a great point about uh
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
non-salaried employees or bonus or
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
commissions would you have a look would
 
00:57:33.599 --> 00:57:34.309 align:start position:0%
commissions would you have a look would
you

00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
under section c would you have a look
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
back period added
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
for for three months more months that's
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
a good idea
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
and actually i i missed
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
that important point in there i
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
when the question was raised with me
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
immediately to my mind came the idea of
 
00:57:54.549 --> 00:57:54.559 align:start position:0%
employees who are on a salary but also
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
receive commissions or bonuses or tips
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
and i didn't understand or hear
 
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:00.799 align:start position:0%
the point
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
that uh some people are on commission
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
and such a hundred percent
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you that would be a good
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
solution to that to that matter it would
 
00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative mandeville
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for uh
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
providing testimony uh i may be the only
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
one who struggles with this so forgive
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
me if that's the case but
 
00:58:23.599 --> 00:58:24.390 align:start position:0%
me if that's the case but
the

00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
meaning and extent of the phrase medical
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
mandates is what i focus on
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
and for example i wonder if a a business
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
has a rule that
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
and it's mandated on employees that they
 
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
not come into work if they have a cold
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
flu or persistent cough
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
and an employee
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
thinks well here's a chance to get a
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
nice severance agreement
 
00:58:52.079 --> 00:58:52.950 align:start position:0%
nice severance agreement
by

00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
deciding to come in that's just one
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
example i don't know what if you could
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
define for us what the intended
 
00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.829 align:start position:0%
define for us what the intended
um

00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:01.839 --> 00:59:04.069 align:start position:0%
um
um

00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
uh breadth of
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
what a medical mandate is on the statute
 
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh i think the answer to that is
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
inherent uh in the bill if uh let's take
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
the example you say which is a good one
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh because people
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
willing to come in and work themselves
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
to death with the flu or a cold or
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
whatever and they can infect uh other
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
employees or the owners
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh but that's not a terminating medical
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
mandate an employer
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
has the right to tell an employee look
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
you're sick as a dog i don't want you
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
making everybody else sick go home
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
right he's not saying you're fired
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
he's saying go home come back when you
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
feel better
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm putting it rather casually but
 
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
this is in fact the point
 
00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.309 align:start position:0%
this is in fact the point
um

00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
now what could lead to a termination if
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
that employee says no by gum i'm coming
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
in and working
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
it's not a case where the
 
01:00:09.599 --> 01:00:10.870 align:start position:0%
it's not a case where the
but

01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
to answer your question more fully and
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
take in all contingencies
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
if an employee comes in with a head cold
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
and the employer says you're fired
 
01:00:23.349 --> 01:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
then the answer to your question is yes
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
for the sponsor
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%

for considering and for taking my
testimony

01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%

01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
next up i would like to call peter
 
01:00:38.319 --> 01:00:39.589 align:start position:0%
next up i would like to call peter
mckenna

01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
mckenna
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
to represent the department of labor who
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
thank you to the committee my name is
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
peter mckenna and i'm an attorney with
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of labor
 
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions that you
 
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
have but there are a couple of things
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
that we did want to note about this bill
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
this bill would be amending a section of
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
rsa 275 which would be under the
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
department of labor statute and it would
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
fall under the department to enforce
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
this so there are a couple of questions
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
or points that we would want to clarify
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
about the bill if it were to go forward
 
01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
and be passed
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned and it is something
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
that we would want clarified as well
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
which is the definition of a medical
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
mandate under the bill
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
because there are some clarifications as
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
to what that actually would mean to not
 
01:01:39.839 --> 01:01:41.109 align:start position:0%
to what that actually would mean to not
clarify

01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh to not comply with a medical mandate
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
the one that we had a question about
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
actually would be a drug test to not
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
comply with a drug test there is a
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
question as to whether
 
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
requiring people to comply with a drug
 
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
test as a medical mandate of an employer
 
01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
and if employees said i'm not taking a
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
drug test and they were terminated for
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
refusing to comply with a drug test
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
have they refused to comply with a
 
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
medical mandate and would they then be
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
entitled to six-month severance under
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
the bill is currently written
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
it's unclear to us if they would be and
 
01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
if we were called to enforce the bill
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's unclear how that would come down
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
with the bill currently written and so
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
some clarification going forward if the
 
01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
bill were to be passed on that point
 
01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
would be helpful
 
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
the second point that we think
 
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
clarification would be helpful is in
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
what the monthly severance pay would
 
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
actually be because there's two ways
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
that we could currently read the monthly
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
severance pay
 
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
let's say that you you have an employee
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
who made a hundred thousand dollars over
 
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
the life of their employment but they
 
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
averaged one thousand dollars a month
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
for their salary you could read
 
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the value of the employees
 
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
total compensation two ways you could
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
say that
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
one if they were to be their monthly
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
severance would be sixty six thousand
 
01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
dollars per month for six months because
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's two thirds of the value of their
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
total compensation is sixty six thousand
 
01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
dollars so they would get sixty six
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per month for six
 
01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:05.240 align:start position:0%
months or you could read that as
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
666 dollars is their two-thirds of their
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
monthly average wage so that's what they
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
would get for six months it's unclear
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
from the way the bill is written so we
 
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
would like some clarification on that
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
point going forward
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
i think those were the only two points
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
that we had about enforcement and
 
01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
clarification if you have any questions
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer them but those
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
are the only two points we wanted to
 
01:03:26.319 --> 01:03:27.349 align:start position:0%
are the only two points we wanted to
raise

01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
raise
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for your testimony
 
01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:29.839 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
 
01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:32.870 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
department

01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
i don't see any thank you very much
 
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank you next up i'm going to ask paula

hampshire hospital association and is
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill she has some written
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman members of the
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
paula minihan senior vice president
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
state government relations for the new
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital association
 
01:04:20.549 --> 01:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
representing all our hospitals in new
 
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire we are opposed to house bill
 
01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:25.589 align:start position:0%
hampshire we are opposed to house bill
1143

01:04:25.589 --> 01:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
1143
 
01:04:25.599 --> 01:04:26.549 align:start position:0%
1143
um

01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
let's see the position um it is our
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
position that employers have the right
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
to determine what is best for their
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
employees and their clients patients and
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
or patrons while this bill does not
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
define as stated what a medical mandate
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
is it could be interpreted to mean and
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
it sounds like that was the intent of
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
the sponsor
 
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
to require
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
to mean requiring vaccinations as a
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
condition of employment
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
requiring vaccinations of health care
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
workers from communicable diseases is
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
not new for hospitals and i think i've
 
01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
already testified to that in front of
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
your committee
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
on another bill hospitals have required
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
vaccination against several communicable
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
and deadly diseases such as mumps
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
measles rubella chickenpox diphtheria
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
tetanus pertussis
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
and influenza as a condition of
 
01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
employment with the same type of medical
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
and religious exemptions allowed for
 
01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:17.829 align:start position:0%
and religious exemptions allowed for
covid19

01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
covid19
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
we believe it is absolutely the right
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
thing to do for the health and safety of
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
our patients our staff and the citizens
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
and the vast majority of hospital staff
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
have been vaccinated against covid or
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
have received exemptions and we've heard
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
from many health care workers who
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
support the vaccine requirement so i
 
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
think that's an important point that
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
they feel safe and going to work because
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
people are vaccinated or that is a
 
01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.789 align:start position:0%
people are vaccinated or that is a
requirement

01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals are private organizations and
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
have extensive written policies
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
regarding employment requirements
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
including vaccination requirements this
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
bill would require all private employers
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
to submit their policies to the state
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
i we believe it's onerous and we
 
01:06:01.029 --> 01:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
question the authority and
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
appropriateness of such a mandate on
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
private employers and why just policies
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
regarding medical mandates as the bill
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
states hospitals are regulated as most
 
01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
private employers by the federal
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
occupational health and safety
 
01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.309 align:start position:0%
occupational health and safety
administration

01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
administration
 
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
not necessarily by the department of
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
labor so that's that's a somewhat of a
 
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
conflict um we are all also it's
 
01:06:23.829 --> 01:06:23.839 align:start position:0%
important to note that very very few
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
individuals have either chosen to leave
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
employment with a hospital
 
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
due to this requirement or have been
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
relieved of their position however this
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
bill would cause we believe a perverse
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
incentive to encourage individuals to
 
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
choose to not to comply
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
with the requirement to be vaccinated
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
since this would end up re they end up
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
receiving six months of severance
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
the bill before you does not um specify
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
is not specific to covid vaccines which
 
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
causes additional concerns and confusion
 
01:06:54.789 --> 01:06:54.799 align:start position:0%
for employers due to the open-ended
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
nature of the bill language we also
 
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
question why this bill does not have a
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and after hearing the
 
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
testimony of the sponsor it sounds like
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
actually pretty extensive
 
01:07:07.039 --> 01:07:08.230 align:start position:0%
actually pretty extensive
requirements

01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
for the state and
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
we believe that there is a measurable
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
financial impact to the state of new
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire including
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
to include
 
01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
increased litigation and associated
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
court costs not to mention all the other
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
reporting etc that
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
is contemplated
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to this bill and we urge
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
the committee to find it in expedient to
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
legislate happy to answer any questions
 
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:36.549 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
questions

01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again thank you
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
next i'd like to ask
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
david giuve representing bia
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for the record my
 
01:07:57.270 --> 01:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
name is dave giuve i'm a senior vice
 
01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
president for public policy with the
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
business and industry association
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
which serves as the statewide chamber of
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
commerce we have approximately 400 plus
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
employer members with over 80 000
 
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
employees throughout the state we are in
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill uh a number of
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
our reasons for opposition have already
 
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
been articulated so i won't dwell on
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
those but i
 
01:08:19.679 --> 01:08:20.630 align:start position:0%
those but i
will

01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
focus on the lack of a definition for
 
01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
medical mandate because
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
that's very broad and it could include
 
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
things like
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
mask usage i refer to that specifically
 
01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:33.669 align:start position:0%
mask usage i refer to that specifically
because

01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
if you are an employer that is not under
 
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
the federal mandate
 
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
very few employers around the state are
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
implementing covet 19 vaccine mandates
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
and the reason why
 
01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
is because they understand that a
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of their employees
 
01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:51.590 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of their employees
are

01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine defiant for lack of a better
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
word they don't want to get the vaccine
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
and they are concerned about losing what
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
could be a significant um
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
uh percentage of their workforce so
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
i hope this committee understands that
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
companies in general
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
around the state are not implementing
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
coven 19 vaccine requirements unless
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
they are under a federal
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
mandate to do so
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
that's not universal but but the
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
percentage is is very very small
 
01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.110 align:start position:0%
percentage is is very very small
um

01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
many companies especially those in the
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
hospitality and travel and tourism area
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
are implementing mask mandates and for
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
their employees and we see it all the
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
time whenever we go to a restaurant or
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
if we go to a hotel employees are
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
generally not universally but generally
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
masked and that's because of a
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
mandate on the part of the employer does
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
that qualify under medical mandate i'm
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
not sure but if it does that would that
 
01:09:53.829 --> 01:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
would impact a large number of employers
 
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
around the state
 
01:09:58.229 --> 01:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
the other thing that seems to be missing
 
01:09:59.669 --> 01:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
in this
 
01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
is the length of employment that the
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
employee would have under this bill is
 
01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:05.430 align:start position:0%
employee would have under this bill is
written

01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
and an individual could accept
 
01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.950 align:start position:0%
and an individual could accept
employment

01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
employment
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
with the understanding that there's a
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate that they would have to
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
comply with if they didn't qualify for a
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
medical or religious exemption
 
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
and then the next day
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
say you know what
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
i don't want to comply with that mandate
 
01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
i'm quitting and now all of a sudden
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
because of this legislation or this
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
proposal the employer's on the hook for
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
for six months of two-thirds salary that
 
01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
individual could
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
later in the week accept employment with
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
another company it's easy to find jobs
 
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
right now and do the same thing over
 
01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
again and over again and over again so
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
there's already been a discussion about
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
well how do we track if the employee
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
the terminated employee gets other
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
employment and i don't know that there's
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
any easy answer to that
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
but please recognize that the way this
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
is written
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's sort of like just opening up a
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
savings account for individuals
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
in continuum to to take advantage of
 
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
this legislation so one thing i uh the
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor said that i strongly agree with
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
state governments and federal
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
governments do regulate businesses and
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
we all understand that which is why it's
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
really critical
 
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
for for this committee to
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
weigh regulation and what its potential
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
impact and unforeseen consequences could
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
be on employers that concludes my
 
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
testimony i'd be happy to answer any
 
01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.390 align:start position:0%
testimony i'd be happy to answer any
questions

01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
was that a hand or no i did see
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
my questions uh
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
i believe this whole vaccine and mask
 
01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
and all it's all fear-based um you know
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
some people are afraid to catch getting
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
the virus and they'll get the vaccine
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
some people are afraid of the vaccine
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to get blood
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
clots and and what have you okay uh one
 
01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
one group sphere is no no more
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
legitimate than the others
 
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
the worker shortage
 
01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
that we're facing now you hear about it
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
every day
 
01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
especially in nursing i mean i should
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
ask this one uh you know you go to the
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
hospital and uh there's a long wait in
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
that emergency room six seven eight
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
hours uh you know they can't they can't
 
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
fill all the beds because they don't
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
have the nurses to do it um
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's my belief and would you
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
believe that you know that this this has
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
a lot to do with it
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
nurse nurses are quitting and you want
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
to find find jobs with with uh you know
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
other nursing agencies uh we've got a
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
couple right here in the legislature
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
that have done it
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to find jobs with other
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
other agencies that don't have a mask i
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
mean a vaccine mandate um you know this
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
thing's thrown a monkey wrench
 
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
into the whole thing and um
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
i i don't know where the the
 
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:08.950 align:start position:0%
the uh
uh

01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's an awful lot for what you believe
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
yeah we could
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
keep it to questions about the testimony
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
that we've heard rather than additional
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
testimony from the committee no okay um
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
i i guess that would be it you know
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
should i i can't i can't put the wrap
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
that our own i'd like to respond if i
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
could and i'll try and keep it brief
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um uh
 
01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:32.310 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um uh
your

01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:33.750 align:start position:0%
your
um

01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
observation that that this uh pandemic
 
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
is being driven by fear on both sides i
 
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
think is interesting i've honestly never
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
thought about it in that way but
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
um i i guess using myself as an example
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh i which i am vaccinated um and i
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
you know now that i think about it in
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
that way yes i it was a fear i wanted i
 
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
did not want to get covet as it turned
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
out i did anyway but my symptoms were
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
very mild i think in large part to the
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
fact that i was vaccinated
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
i think another way of putting that
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
would be people
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
and employers
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
want to do
 
01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:15.430 align:start position:0%
want to do
what

01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
they believe based on
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
science and cdc recommendations is in
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
the best interest of their employees
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
customers and people who come into the
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
place of business so that's a
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know a different way of looking at
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
it but but i don't i think what you
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
suggested is an interesting
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
way to look at it in terms of
 
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
specifically of hospitals because we do
 
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
the bia does have many hospital members
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
um and i think you were correct i think
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
there is a handful of nurses not very
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
many because as is the previous is paula
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
minihan from the hospital association
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
testified the vast majority of of people
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
who work in health care nurses
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners doctors
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
are vaccinated i am certain we could
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
find examples of people who chose not to
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
and chose to to leave employment because
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
of that but i think the numbers are
 
01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:15.679 --> 01:15:16.709 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
regardless of
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
where you fall on that issue that
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't really
 
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
impact our our overall objections to the
 
01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:28.790 align:start position:0%
impact our our overall objections to the
bill

01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions for
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything thank you very much
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
for your testimony i have one remaining
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%

01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire association of counties
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
in opposition to the bill and providing
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is kate horgan i
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
serve as the executive director of the
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire association of counties
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%

appointed
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
officials uh in county government today
 
01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
i'm here primarily on behalf of your
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
county nursing home administrators uh
 
01:16:15.669 --> 01:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan did point out
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
one of our major concerns was that this
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
will impact county taxpayers
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
there is no exemption for
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
public employers and your county nursing
 
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
homes are subject to the federal mandate
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
i will also point out that
 
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
county in the county homes we did a
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
quick survey about how many people have
 
01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
chosen to leave because of the mandates
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
that are coming down no one has been
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
terminated that includes the two
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
counties that
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
implemented the mandate at the end of
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
november beginning of december last year
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
and less than one percent of people have
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
been unable to get vaccinated or get an
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
exemption that includes a mixture of
 
01:16:59.679 --> 01:17:01.110 align:start position:0%
exemption that includes a mixture of
population

01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
from our employees including dietary
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
maintenance and our nursing staff so
 
01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
we've been able to
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
work with people to uh find a solution
 
01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
for them so we don't think this bill is
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
necessary also it was just pointed out
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
that there is a workforce shortage in
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
this state i just want to remind you as
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
members of your county delegation you
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
all probably are very much aware that
 
01:17:26.550 --> 01:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
that nursing shortage was in place well
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic has the pandemic
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
made it worse probably but it was it is
 
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
not a result of the pandemic we were
 
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
already experiencing workforce shortages
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
um i did also want to just comment uh
 
01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
because i know there's been some
 
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
discussion about whether or not cms
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
would take
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
or pull the federal funding
 
01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
i would just provide the example of
 
01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
stratfor county in september was fined a
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for not reporting the
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
exact same vaccine
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
information to cms that they had
 
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
reported the week before
 
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
no discussion no negotiation here's your
 
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
bill pay it
 
01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
um and i think that is all i have to
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
offer because everyone else covered
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
everything but i'm happy to take any
 
01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee has
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%

01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:37.280 align:start position:0%

us on time
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%

it does several things
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%

01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
that that requirement shall come with
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
the responsibility and accountability
 
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
for any consequences caused by attempted
 
01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:42.950 align:start position:0%
for any consequences caused by attempted
compliance

01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
as the choice is being made or is being
 
01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:47.590 align:start position:0%
as the choice is being made or is being
mandated

01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
mandated
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
and being made by private entities
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
without representation or consent to the
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
people of the state
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
additional burdens shall we
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
will be laid upon
 
01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:58.830 align:start position:0%
will be laid upon
the

01:20:58.830 --> 01:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
entities and what it basically does is
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
it grants
 
01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.350 align:start position:0%
it grants
standing

01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
standing
 
01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:06.229 align:start position:0%
standing
um

01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
for the moving party upon showing that
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
the moving party has suffered any amount
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
of loss or damage
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
which may have been caused by their
 
01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
attempted compliance with the entity's
 
01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:18.390 align:start position:0%
attempted compliance with the entity's
mandate

01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
so what this does is basically say
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:26.239 --> 01:21:27.430 align:start position:0%
 
wants

01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
wants
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
desires to fulfill a mandate to get
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
access to employment or to get access to
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
goods and services
 
01:21:36.159 --> 01:21:37.110 align:start position:0%
goods and services
and

01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
they do so and
 
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
are injured by that
 
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
that they have the ability to say hey
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
i've been injured by this and it will
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
give them standing to then
 
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
have their day in court and prove with
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
the preponderance of evidence
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
that that it was actually caused by them
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
complying to that specific individual's
 
01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:59.669 align:start position:0%
complying to that specific individual's
mandate

01:21:59.669 --> 01:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
01:21:59.679 --> 01:22:03.350 align:start position:0%
mandate
um

01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
there's been there's a lot
 
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
i just sat in on the last bill and
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of questions about
 
01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:16.629 --> 01:22:16.639 align:start position:0%
get involved in
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
setting rules for for businesses in
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
reality this doesn't even do that
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
if a business chooses not to have a rule
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
or a mandate they don't have to worry
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
about it at all that's their choice
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
if a business decides to have a rule or
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
a mandate that
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
for for employment or for access to
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
their goods and services all this is
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
doing is saying that if you choose to
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
make that decision for another human
 
01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:43.910 align:start position:0%
make that decision for another human
being

01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
that you're responsible for any damage
 
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
that occurs to the person if they're
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
trying to comply with it
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
now there's there's an argument that
 
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
i've heard by from many that say well if
 
01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
the person doesn't want to do it they
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
can just
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
not do it not get not work or not you
 
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
know not work at that particular
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
business or not go and um get what
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
they're they're trying to get from a
 
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
particular um you know
 
01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
vendor or or service provider
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
but the truth of the matter is
 
01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:17.510 align:start position:0%
but the truth of the matter is
that

01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
what we tend to call rules or or
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
mandates revolve around coercion of one
 
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
sword or another
 
01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
and coercion though it sounds like a bad
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
word is something that all of us do all
 
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
the time we've been doing it since
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
kindergarten do the right thing i'll
 
01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
give you a star do the wrong thing i put
 
01:23:35.669 --> 01:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
you in the corner
 
01:23:35.679 --> 01:23:36.550 align:start position:0%
you in the corner
okay

01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not trying to fight that that's how
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
our world works that's our penal system
 
01:23:40.239 --> 01:23:41.510 align:start position:0%
our world works that's our penal system
works

01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
works
 
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to do is say that if
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
you're making that decision
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
that you're responsible for damages
 
01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
caused by that decision and that's what
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to do with this bill
 
01:23:52.239 --> 01:23:55.030 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to do with this bill
um

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.149 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
i would ask for your support
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
so that we can give people some sort of
 
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
ability to say hey i have been damaged
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
by something that you asked me to do
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
now the idea that well
 
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
they don't have to do that it's true but
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
if you take an individual
 
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
um one of the things i learned in the
 
01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.189 align:start position:0%
um one of the things i learned in the
military

01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
military
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
was that if you torture a person enough
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
they'll break
 
01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
everybody breaks
 
01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:27.910 align:start position:0%
everybody breaks
okay

01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
and then i hear another thing all the
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
time where people say well
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
everybody has their price
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
so if we make the the carrot big enough
 
01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
if we make the the the plus big enough
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
well i can get people to do that too
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
so eventually if i make the carrot big
 
01:24:46.629 --> 01:24:46.639 align:start position:0%
enough or i make the stick
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
painful enough
 
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
the person's going to do what i want
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
them to do they're going to submit at
 
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
some point
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
all this is saying that is if i'm doing
 
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:54.870 align:start position:0%
all this is saying that is if i'm doing
that

01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
i need to be careful not to harm people
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
in doing it
 
01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
that's all all i'm asking is that
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
we put some laws in place so that
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
when people are making this
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
determination and setting these rules
 
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
that they put more consideration they
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
are very careful to make sure that what
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
they're asking people what they're
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
asking their employees or other people
 
01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
i ask for your support in this bill and
 
01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:27.750 align:start position:0%
i ask for your support in this bill and
i'm

01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions on it
 
01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.669 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions on it

um

01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
could you give me an example
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
just reading the la starting on 22
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
where it says a business private
 
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
business entity that imposes a medical
 
01:25:46.159 --> 01:25:47.750 align:start position:0%
business entity that imposes a medical
mandate

01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to leave employee out for
 
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
now on a customer could you give me an
 
01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:52.790 align:start position:0%
now on a customer could you give me an
example

01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:53.510 align:start position:0%
example
of

01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
how or where that would apply in other
 
01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:56.310 align:start position:0%
how or where that would apply in other
words

01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
words
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
business a gives puts out a mandate for
 
01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
their customer and somehow a customer is
 
01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:03.910 align:start position:0%
their customer and somehow a customer is
uh

01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.270 align:start position:0%
uh
damaged

01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
damaged
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
can you give me an example of that
 
01:26:10.149 --> 01:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
sure um
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
what this is trying to cover is that
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to determine what a
 
01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
person's going to going to submit when
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to break what is it what
 
01:26:22.149 --> 01:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
what good thing or what bad thing is it
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
that's going to cause them well i need
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
to keep my job or i really want to be
 
01:26:29.110 --> 01:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
able to go to these concerts okay
 
01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
so if someone says hey you can't have
 
01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
access to this or you can't have a job
 
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
here unless you do this okay
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
what this is going to do is say that if
 
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
that person decides well i'm going to go
 
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
ahead and do what they ask me
 
01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:45.669 align:start position:0%
ahead and do what they ask me
okay

01:26:45.669 --> 01:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
then they end up getting hurt because of
 
01:26:48.239 --> 01:26:49.510 align:start position:0%
then they end up getting hurt because of
it

01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
that they can at that point say hey i've
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
been harmed and i i need to be able to
 
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:54.790 align:start position:0%
been harmed and i i need to be able to
be

01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:56.629 align:start position:0%
be
um

01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
yes but uh could you give me draw me in
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
a specific example
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
of a private business and a customer
 
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
relationship where this would apply give
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
me an exact
 
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
not a broad one but
 
01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
a customer in our employee relationship
 
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
not employee no customer a business and
 
01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
a customer okay
 
01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:23.910 align:start position:0%
a customer okay
so

01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:24.790 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
you have a business
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
and it says we require um vaccines you
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
got to show us your vaccine passport to
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
gain entrance into our business for
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
goods and services so
 
01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:36.790 align:start position:0%
goods and services so
um

01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
someone goes to that business and they
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
say hey i want to come in here and they
 
01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
say well you can't because because you
 
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
you're not fulfilling this requirement
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
and they say okay well i really want to
 
01:27:50.310 --> 01:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
shop here so i'm going to fulfill that
 
01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.669 align:start position:0%
shop here so i'm going to fulfill that
requirement

01:27:51.669 --> 01:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
and they go and fulfill the requirement
 
01:27:55.110 --> 01:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
and in doing so
 
01:27:58.950 --> 01:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
then they should be able to say hey i
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
this will give them standing so they get
 
01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
their day in court but they're still
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
going to have to show
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
that it was that particular businesses
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
requirement that they were trying to
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
fulfill and that the
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
um damage is related directly to that
 
01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.470 align:start position:0%
um damage is related directly to that
requirement

01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
so if it's a vaccine passport you'd have
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
to show a preponderance of evidence that
 
01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%
you were harmed by the vaccine
 
01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
so all this is doing is really giving
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
also

01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative warden followed by thank
 
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
if you looked
 
01:28:46.629 --> 01:28:46.639 align:start position:0%
if you interpreted this
 
01:28:46.639 --> 01:28:47.669 align:start position:0%
if you interpreted this
language

01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:28:47.679 --> 01:28:50.390 align:start position:0%
language
broadly

01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
i could it says that if
 
01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:54.870 align:start position:0%
i could it says that if
somebody

01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
has any damage
 
01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:58.310 align:start position:0%
has any damage
that

01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
happened from attempted compliance with
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
the medical mandate and i wonder if you
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
share my concern that if that's
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
interpreted too broadly for example
 
01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:07.189 align:start position:0%
interpreted too broadly for example
somebody

01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
might be driving
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
walgreens drugstore to get
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
a vaccination let's say if that's
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
required by the employer
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
and on the way there he gets in a
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
traffic accident
 
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
because he was trying to comply with
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
this mandate but it's any damages and
 
01:29:29.189 --> 01:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
now the employer is responsible for the
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
car accident medical bills can you see
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
how it could be interpreted that way
 
01:29:35.110 --> 01:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
well i do but in order to do that you
 
01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
would have to prove one
 
01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
that you were going to that walmart to
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
fulfill a
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
mandate that a particular employer or a
 
01:29:46.719 --> 01:29:47.750 align:start position:0%
mandate that a particular employer or a
particular

01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:48.950 align:start position:0%
particular
uh

01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
company had in order for you to have
 
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
that access so you'd have to prove that
 
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
that was the case
 
01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
and then um you would have to prove that
 
01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:03.030 align:start position:0%
and then um you would have to prove that
um

01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
it was related directly to that i don't
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
see that i mean it would take a
 
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
preponderance of evidence i don't see
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:13.110 --> 01:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question

thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
representative taking the question can
 
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
you define private business entity for
 
01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:22.390 align:start position:0%
you define private business entity for
me

01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
a private business entity is any private
 
01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:28.310 align:start position:0%
a private business entity is any private
company

01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
from one person to a thousand
 
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
the way i read
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not employed anymore so
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
employee doesn't apply to me but i am a
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
customer right um
 
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
and um let's say that um i go out i'm
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
like mr gervais i i get the vaccine
 
01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
because i don't want to get covered
 
01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:58.070 align:start position:0%
because i don't want to get covered
and

01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
but when i get the vaccine
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
i suffered some sort of damage my wife
 
01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
was sick for a full day that was damage
 
01:31:06.159 --> 01:31:07.030 align:start position:0%
was sick for a full day that was damage
um

01:31:07.030 --> 01:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
the way i read this
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
it would appear that
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
at that point i've been damaged by the
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine i can now go after every
 
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
company for which i'm a customer
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
that has a vaccine requirement for
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know access
 
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
and i can
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
collect damages from each and every one
 
01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
of them because i'm a customer at all of
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
these various companies
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
can you respond oh sure
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
um well one you could go after one you
 
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't go after every company
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
because well because what you're saying
 
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
one particular company's mandate is the
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
one that caused you to get that vaccine
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
so once you've done one you'd be done
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is you would have to
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
prove that
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
that particular company's mandate's the
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
one that caused you to
 
01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
attempt to get the vaccine and then you
 
01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
would have to prove that the damage that
 
01:32:07.110 --> 01:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
you suffered was from the vaccine
 
01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
i hear what you're saying but i don't
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
see it in the build language um
 
01:32:18.149 --> 01:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
can you point out where all of these
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
requirements for one and done uh for
 
01:32:23.350 --> 01:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
example is in there it just talks about
 
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
a customer and it doesn't say that a
 
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
particular company um would
 
01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
be the
 
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
the one thing that motivated me to get
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
uh vaccinated all it says is if i'm
 
01:32:35.669 --> 01:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
damaged by the vaccine
 
01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
i can um collect from any company for
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
which i'm a customer
 
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
um damages
 
01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:43.430 align:start position:0%
um damages
well

01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i don't see
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
it that way
 
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
but uh and and i do believe that in this
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's a you know it is saying that a
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
private company okay
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
um i understand your concern and i would
 
01:32:59.189 --> 01:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
be you know willing to to amend the
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
language to to cover that um
 
01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:03.990 align:start position:0%
language to to cover that um
but

01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:33:05.669 --> 01:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
i honestly i don't see it that way but
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to make changes if necessary
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mandeville
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for your
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
testimony uh at several points in your
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
testimony you
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
used the word
 
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
injured or hurt
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
and yet the
 
01:33:22.639 --> 01:33:24.070 align:start position:0%
and yet the
proposed

01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh bill
 
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
on line 24 for example talks about any
 
01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:29.189 align:start position:0%
on line 24 for example talks about any
damages

01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
damages
 
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
on line 26 talks about any amount of
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
loss or damage which may have been
 
01:33:34.639 --> 01:33:36.709 align:start position:0%
loss or damage which may have been
caused

01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
caused
 
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
i take it from reading the bill that
 
01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:39.669 align:start position:0%
i take it from reading the bill that
this

01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
injury-based damage necessarily but
 
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
could include any kind of economic
 
01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:49.750 align:start position:0%
could include any kind of economic
damage

01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
damage
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
or consequential damage
 
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:58.629 align:start position:0%
 
a

01:33:58.629 --> 01:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
an attempted compliance
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
with the medical
 
01:34:02.239 --> 01:34:03.830 align:start position:0%
with the medical
mandate

01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
did you intend it to be as
 
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
broad as that
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
such that perhaps someone who lost a
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
business opportunity
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
could sue for the loss of business
 
01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity or did you intend it to be
 
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
more limited
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
to the kind of
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
damages that occur as a matter of a
 
01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:27.189 align:start position:0%
damages that occur as a matter of a
medical

01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
its intent
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
was not to be quite that broad in the
 
01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
way that you just put it um and again
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
it's something that that i certainly
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
would be willing to amend i think that
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
overall its intent is to
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that that there is
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
some recourse for individuals that are
 
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
severely injured um
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
when a company
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
private entity makes a decision for them
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:06.149 --> 01:35:06.159 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
 
01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:09.830 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
representative

01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much
 
01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you like to call
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
peter mcnamara and uh pauline paula hand
 
01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
uh peter peter mcnamara department of
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
labor we are behind schedule so i
 
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if you would be
 
01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:28.470 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if you would be
brief

01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
my name is peter mckenna and i'm an
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
attorney with the new hampshire
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
department of labor
 
01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
this bill would be amending
 
01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
chapter 275 so it would fall to the
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
department of labor to enforce this
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
and there are a couple of provisions
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
that are specific to the enforcement
 
01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
here at labor that i wanted to highlight
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
because they would be
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
of concern if we were to enforce this
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
the first is specific to the question of
 
01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:05.189 align:start position:0%
the first is specific to the question of
damages

01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
damages
 
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
under this bill damages would not be
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
defined and so i want to provide some
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
context because for the department there
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
are a couple of
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
types of damages that we do have
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
encounters with and that we do enforce
 
01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
as it relates to workers compensation
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
because we do deal with workers
 
01:36:20.159 --> 01:36:21.590 align:start position:0%
because we do deal with workers
compensation

01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
and when a worker is injured there are
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
two kinds of damages that we do
 
01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:26.390 align:start position:0%
two kinds of damages that we do
encounter

01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
encounter
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
obviously one is medical bills we deal
 
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
with any kind of medical bills that they
 
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
incur and the payments for those
 
01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
as well as any loss of earnings
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
potential oh excuse me as well as any
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
loss of earnings potential but there are
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
a number of other damages that we don't
 
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
ever deal with or calculate
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
pain and suffering emotional damages
 
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
loss of consortium none of those are
 
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
ones that we ever deal with or calculate
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
but under this bill damages is not
 
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
defined and so it seems that those would
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
be encapsulated in this definition and
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
they would fall to us to enforce
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
but they're not damages that we
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
traditionally ever deal with that our
 
01:37:05.109 --> 01:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
hearing officers ever calculate and so
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's something that just traditionally
 
01:37:10.149 --> 01:37:10.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't fall to us or that
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
the statutes ever impose on us
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
the second is that labor traditionally
 
01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
and always deals with employers and
 
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
employees those are the relationships
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
that we deal with those are the parties
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
that we deal with this statute would
 
01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
inject a third party into that and that
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
is customers we don't ever deal with
 
01:37:29.189 --> 01:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
customers that's not something that
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
labor has dealt with historically
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
and so that would that would be a third
 
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
party that we would now be adjudicating
 
01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
claims with
 
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
um and so seeing that this bill is
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
really granting standing to deal with a
 
01:37:43.189 --> 01:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
certain new class of claims
 
01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh it might make sense if we're going to
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
be imbuing standing for this kind of
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
claim to put it elsewhere because of the
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
issues of damages and this new party
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
given that labor doesn't deal with these
 
01:37:57.669 --> 01:37:57.679 align:start position:0%
kinds of damages nor this party um if it
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
were to be put with labor certainly we
 
01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
take no position and we would find a way
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
to make it work but i did want to note
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
that on the damages and on the parties
 
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
they would both be unusual in that labor
 
01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
has not dealt with either of those in
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
the past
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
and has been noted in the past and other
 
01:38:13.679 --> 01:38:14.790 align:start position:0%
and has been noted in the past and other
bills

01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
don't need to expand on it either but
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
there is no definition of medical
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
mandate it can be interpreted very
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
broadly a limiting definition can be
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
helpful in enforcement apart from that i
 
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
don't have anything to add and would be
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%

we are opposed to house bill 1410
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
it does require as stated on an employer
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
to assume liability for any damages that
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
employee or customer can prove to have
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
occurred as a result of attempted
 
01:39:44.950 --> 01:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
compliance with medical mandates um as
 
01:39:47.590 --> 01:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
has been stated there's some confu
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
we find this bill confusing we actually
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
don't believe it's necessary and
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
it raises a lot of questions and i'll
 
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
just rattle off a couple that have
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
already been actually raised medical
 
01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
mandates not defined unclear what the
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor means by that term but we're
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
assuming he's referring to the vaccine

01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
grabbed my question
 
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
we ran this by some of our hr directors
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
and they had that exact same question
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
attempted compliance if they were
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
driving to a location to get a vaccine
 
01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
and they got into an accident what does
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
that mean that the employer would be
 
01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
liable um it's unclear but that's the
 
01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
exact um example that an hr director
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
came up with there's also federal
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%

other examples that hr gave me but
 
01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
for all these reasons we are opposed to
 
01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
this bill and we urge you to find this
 
01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
bill in expedient to legislate happy to
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%

01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative seaworth
 
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
that testimony i want to go back to one
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
of the things that you said at the
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
beginning of your testimony was that
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is not necessary and i'm
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
interested in some details on that and
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll make up an example
 
01:41:43.679 --> 01:41:44.550 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll make up an example
um

01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
let's say i i want to go into a hospital
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
for surgery and
 
01:41:49.199 --> 01:41:49.990 align:start position:0%
for surgery and
the

01:41:49.990 --> 01:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
the hospital tells me before you do you
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
get this prescription in preparation for
 
01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
for coming in
 
01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:00.159 align:start position:0%
and i don't really want to get it but
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
that's the condition so i do and i'm
 
01:42:02.159 --> 01:42:03.830 align:start position:0%
that's the condition so i do and i'm
injured

01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
injured
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
do i now have standing to say
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
i was injured as a result of something
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
you did is that part of why you say the
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
bill isn't necessary well i don't know
 
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
that this bill
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
contemplates that necessarily um
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
we're imposing a medical mandate on an
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
employee not on a patient
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
or a customer
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
i guess you could consider yourself a
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
customer i don't consider patients
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:38.239 --> 01:42:39.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
that is um info called informed consent
 
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
when you are um
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
agreeing with your medical provider for
 
01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
um whatever surgery or whatever service
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
that is needed you you go through a
 
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
informed consent process and that is
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
part of um
 
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
you know medical liability and all that
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
so that i don't see that really
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
contemplated here we're talking about
 
01:43:04.950 --> 01:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
employees um
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
and again workers comp um laws
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
i think um cover cover the those
 
01:43:10.719 --> 01:43:12.470 align:start position:0%
i think um cover cover the those
scenarios

01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
scenarios
 
01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i've answered your
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:20.550 --> 01:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
i don't see additional hands thank you
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
very much thank you
 
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i will be brief
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
because i know you're behind schedule uh
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
for the record again my name is dave
 
01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
giuve senior vice president with the
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
business and industry association we are
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
here in opposition to this bill there's
 
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
been a lot
 
01:43:54.390 --> 01:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
discussed in uh why it's problematic a
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
couple of things i would like to
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
add to that and i actually would like to
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
focus on the whole customer aspect of
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
this bill because i think representative
 
01:44:04.470 --> 01:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
sullivan i believe raised a pretty
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
interesting point of which
 
01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
i became aware of this morning i made
 
01:44:13.109 --> 01:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
reservations at a restaurant
 
01:44:15.510 --> 01:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh for the weekend to take my wife out
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
and they clearly said
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry making brownie points for
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
valentine's day
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
happy wife happy life
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
um the restaurant clearly indicated
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
proof of vaccination will be required
 
01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
for for entry
 
01:44:33.030 --> 01:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh which is not a problem for us because
 
01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
we're both vaccinated nonetheless
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
uh if this bill went into effect um
 
01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
i could look at that restaurant and any
 
01:44:43.030 --> 01:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
other restaurant or place of business
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
that has that requirement and file a
 
01:44:47.830 --> 01:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
civil lawsuit saying that i was injured
 
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
i don't even really have to be injured
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
to file the lawsuit the company is it
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
you know maybe completely without merit
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
but the company still has to defend
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
themselves so
 
01:45:00.550 --> 01:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
i think this is a little more than a uh
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
public policy that would result in a
 
01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:04.719 align:start position:0%
whole new cottage industry of lawsuits
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
against employers who are who are trying
 
01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
in the face of pandemic so i would ask
 
01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
that you um i don't know that this bill
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
is fixable i would recommend that you
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
kill it thank you mr chair
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
and welcome
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative mandeville recognized for
 
01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
a question thank you mr chairman thank
 
01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
you for testifying um coming back to uh
 
01:45:28.149 --> 01:45:28.159 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth's excellent
 
01:45:30.870 --> 01:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
question uh let's say and you you did
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
mention that your group includes some
 
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
hospitals let's say a hospital had a
 
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
rule that uh in order to have surgery
 
01:45:38.229 --> 01:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
you needed to have certain blood work
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
done and so you went to a place to get
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
blood work done and they injured you
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
would your reading of this bill create
 
01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:47.430 align:start position:0%
would your reading of this bill create
an

01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
a legal obligation of the hospital
 
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
for the injuries that you had sustained
 
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
by virtue of the
 
01:45:58.950 --> 01:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
blood testing facility
 
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh i i think your question is a good
 
01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
illustration of one of the problems with
 
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is that it is so broad almost
 
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
anything could apply the prime sponsor
 
01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned if you were involved in a
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
traffic accident on the way to get a
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
vaccine that would
 
01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
apply well what if you were ran a red
 
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
light and created the accident is the
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
is the business entity somehow now
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for the damage that created
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know we could probably come up with
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
a thousand different examples
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
of of whether this bill would or would
 
01:46:33.669 --> 01:46:33.679 align:start position:0%
not apply but but to me that's one of
 
01:46:40.149 --> 01:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:40.159 --> 01:46:42.229 align:start position:0%
 
love

01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
love
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thanks for taking my
 
01:46:46.229 --> 01:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
question uh correct me if i'm wrong
 
01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
but i believe that an employer has uh no
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
no right to your uh
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
say for instance hiv status uh hep c
 
01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
status and a host of other things
 
01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:58.229 align:start position:0%
status and a host of other things
uh

01:46:58.229 --> 01:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
why did they have access to your vaccine
 
01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:01.510 align:start position:0%
why did they have access to your vaccine
status

01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
status
 
01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:04.719 align:start position:0%
well um with respect you you are wrong
 
01:47:06.550 --> 01:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
for employers who are under the federal
 
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
mandate they are obligated to
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
collect that information
 
01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:13.830 align:start position:0%
collect that information
and

01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:15.669 --> 01:47:15.679 align:start position:0%
keep a record of it of course those
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
records are confidential the way any
 
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
employee information would be held
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
confidential but employers under uh the
 
01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
federal vaccine mandates do
 
01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
have a requirement to collect that
 
01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.830 align:start position:0%
have a requirement to collect that
information

01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:32.790 align:start position:0%
follow up
so

01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates and
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
um other things uh they contradict each
 
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
other's what you're saying
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
um you know the federal man vaccine
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
mandate and i guess it's hipaa where you
 
01:47:44.709 --> 01:47:44.719 align:start position:0%
know you're not entitled to my my
 
01:47:47.189 --> 01:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
medical background um you know that it
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like to me like there's
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
a different definite contradiction here
 
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh if that contradiction exists it's
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
going to take someone far more clever
 
01:48:00.870 --> 01:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
than i to puzzle it out
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:04.149 --> 01:48:04.159 align:start position:0%

01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know i i discovered that
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
the there was no no uh no background
 
01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
check done on this uh this individual
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
and uh and
 
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
you know we we did stop it at the at the
 
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
taylor library in in derry uh
 
01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
you know they they decided to go to not
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
have it uh then they were gonna do it in
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
their public park and there was an
 
01:49:22.229 --> 01:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
outrage over that
 
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
and uh then they did it a private entity
 
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
this uh this individual was was dancing
 
01:49:31.510 --> 01:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
with kids rubbing butts uh you know just
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
really going way too far and uh and
 
01:49:35.589 --> 01:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
there was never a background check done
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
on them
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
you know i later found out that a few
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
years ago in nashua
 
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
there was a a drag queen
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
story hour uh and uh
 
01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
later to find out that uh you know the
 
01:49:50.070 --> 01:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
guy was a convicted sex offender and um
 
01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
there's a hole in our law i guess is
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to say you know school
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
bus drivers school teachers school
 
01:49:59.109 --> 01:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
school administrators uh you know school
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
volunteers they all have to have to do
 
01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
anybody working with a child
 
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
except for a lot in the library
 
01:50:08.229 --> 01:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
you know we all received in the email uh
 
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
talking about the the cost and the time
 
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
concerned uh you know uh the cost uh
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll hit on that in a little while
 
01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
but uh you know the time uh i had to go
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
up to the state police uh one time to uh
 
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
to straighten out a background check on
 
01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
a gun purchase okay and uh
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
you know while i i ended up getting it
 
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
straightened out but uh while i was
 
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
there people were there getting
 
01:50:32.550 --> 01:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
10 minutes at the bet at the longest was
 
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
all it took
 
01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:37.109 align:start position:0%
all it took
okay

01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
ten minutes and i i i think it was ten
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
dollars at the time
 
01:50:42.870 --> 01:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
um you know not not a big deal
 
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:50:45.669 --> 01:50:45.679 align:start position:0%
you know uh not when we're talking about
 
01:50:48.229 --> 01:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh you know the a lifelong life a
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
lifetime of misery
 
01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
for a child that's been molested you
 
01:50:54.149 --> 01:50:54.159 align:start position:0%
know uh
 
01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
if i if i conduct indulge into that uh
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
you know i was molested as a child you
 
01:51:03.750 --> 01:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
know at six years old you know uh
 
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:06.080 align:start position:0%

couldn't hang around with me
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh you know as i got a little older you
 
01:51:14.229 --> 01:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
know relationships i i couldn't hold on
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
to anything you know
 
01:51:17.189 --> 01:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:51:19.270 --> 01:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
lost a lot of jobs because of the
 
01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
drinking and drugging uh you know uh
 
01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
doing doing some crazy things you know
 
01:51:24.719 --> 01:51:26.149 align:start position:0%
doing doing some crazy things you know
um

01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
you know eventually getting sober
 
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
you know at 60 years old
 
01:51:32.870 --> 01:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
finally taking a look at this thing you
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
know and uh you know uh
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
it was a a long time of suffering
 
01:51:41.189 --> 01:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
you know a lifetime of suffering and uh
 
01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
you know for us not not to fill this
 
01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:43.750 align:start position:0%
you know for us not not to fill this
hole

01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
hole
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
to me it'd be wrong you know uh i i feel
 
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
very fortunate you know to to be able to
 
01:51:51.669 --> 01:51:51.679 align:start position:0%
sit here you know that this kid that
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
went through all that hell and and and
 
01:51:56.070 --> 01:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
did all that stuff uh gets to sit sit as
 
01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:57.679 align:start position:0%
a member of the new hampshire state
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
legislature and try to fix this uh you
 
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
know and i i'd hope you'd vote otp on
 
01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
any questions representative of
 
01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte
 
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:15.669 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
um

01:52:15.669 --> 01:52:15.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
to focus on fingerprints is this
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
is that analogous to a lot of other
 
01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
background checks that says uh i'm i'm
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar with this at all so is that
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
is that something that's yes exactly
 
01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question uh after uh
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
discussing this with the the state
 
01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
police background check division uh i
 
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
found out that the federal background
 
01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:42.790 align:start position:0%
found out that the federal background
check

01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
check
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
does include fingerprints
 
01:52:46.709 --> 01:52:46.719 align:start position:0%
and it's cheaper
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's four dollars cheaper uh 25 dollars
 
01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
for a state and 21 for a federal
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:03.669 --> 01:53:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative um warden
 
01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
followed by c sullivan yes
 
01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
thanks for your testimony
 
01:53:13.189 --> 01:53:13.199 align:start position:0%
my question is on the definition of a
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
background investigation because in line
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
four you say the
 
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
library shall require a background
 
01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
investigation and
 
01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
a criminal history records check which
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
makes me think that you mean the
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
background investigation is different
 
01:53:31.510 --> 01:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
from a criminal
 
01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:32.709 align:start position:0%
from a criminal
record

01:53:32.709 --> 01:53:32.719 align:start position:0%
record
 
01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
and so i'm just wondering what you mean
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
by background investigations that you
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
know pat call up their parents or call
 
01:53:41.189 --> 01:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
call their past employers
 
01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh if you if you feel if you agree with
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
me that needs further definition
 
01:53:47.109 --> 01:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
i i guess we could probably wrap that
 
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
into into one one or the other i think
 
01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:50.070 align:start position:0%
into into one one or the other i think
they

01:53:50.070 --> 01:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:53:54.310 --> 01:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:57.990 align:start position:0%
 
sullivan

01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
lines uh
 
01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
28 and 29 on the first page
 
01:54:02.719 --> 01:54:03.830 align:start position:0%
28 and 29 on the first page
um

01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:05.189 --> 01:54:05.199 align:start position:0%
says that the
 
01:54:06.790 --> 01:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
trustees may require the candidate to
 
01:54:09.589 --> 01:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
pay the actual cost of
 
01:54:11.669 --> 01:54:11.679 align:start position:0%
seeing how this includes volunteers
 
01:54:13.589 --> 01:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
would you see
 
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
would you think that that might shut
 
01:54:17.109 --> 01:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
down the uh
 
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
the flow of volunteers to libraries if
 
01:54:21.430 --> 01:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
they have to actually pay for their own
 
01:54:23.350 --> 01:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
criminal background check
 
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
see i put the word may in there for the
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
reason of how important is it uh
 
01:54:29.669 --> 01:54:29.679 align:start position:0%
the library would have to make that
 
01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
decision um you know as far as you know
 
01:54:34.149 --> 01:54:34.159 align:start position:0%
having this volunteer
 
01:54:35.910 --> 01:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
how important is it as far as protecting
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:42.790 --> 01:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you representative
 
01:54:45.589 --> 01:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
uh you go on further off of what
 
01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
representative warden said
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
further on towards excuse me in line six
 
01:54:53.109 --> 01:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
of page one the trustee shall require a
 
01:54:55.669 --> 01:54:55.679 align:start position:0%
federal records check
 
01:54:58.629 --> 01:54:58.639 align:start position:0%
would you i don't know what that is
 
01:55:01.669 --> 01:55:01.679 align:start position:0%
the federal federal records uh check
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
does does the whole country uh you know
 
01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:05.679 align:start position:0%
it uh you know does a record check for
 
01:55:06.790 --> 01:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
every state
 
01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
if we do just the state police
 
01:55:10.709 --> 01:55:10.719 align:start position:0%
background check it's for new hampshire
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
so somebody somebody could have moved
 
01:55:14.790 --> 01:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
from connecticut and uh you know been a
 
01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
child sex offender and um
 
01:55:18.790 --> 01:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
you know that they could slip through
 
01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
the cracks
 
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
you specifically reference the situation
 
01:55:31.270 --> 01:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
what i guess i'm trying the point i'm
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
trying to make here is
 
01:55:36.070 --> 01:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
just because they're a drag queen
 
01:55:39.189 --> 01:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
and you want a criminal background check
 
01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
because of that incident or was it this
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
other incident where there was another
 
01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
situation where someone was a convicted
 
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
sex offender in another situation i just
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
want to make sure i understand the
 
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
correlation just because they're a drag
 
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
queen does not make him a sex offender
 
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
but neither is a school bus driver
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
neither is a school volunteer neither is
 
01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
a teacher okay uh if you're going to be
 
01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
working with children
 
01:56:06.070 --> 01:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
you you should be checked out especially
 
01:56:07.589 --> 01:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
if you're going to be rubbing butts with
 
01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
them um you know
 
01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:12.310 align:start position:0%
them um you know
anyway

01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions
 
01:56:17.189 --> 01:56:17.199 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much
 
01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to sit in your seat but
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
you understand you can't ask questions
 
01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
i'm going to call kathy
 
01:56:27.750 --> 01:56:27.760 align:start position:0%

hi thank you kathy growny from the
 
01:56:40.830 --> 01:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
griffin-free public
 
01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
library um i'm here because on behalf of
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
my town my trustee
 
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
we can't hear you okay closer
 
01:56:54.070 --> 01:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
yeah you don't have a sticker if you
 
01:56:56.950 --> 01:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to church you can't hear me
 
01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
let me know i'll speak up
 
01:57:00.870 --> 01:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
my name is kathy growny i'm the library
 
01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:02.719 align:start position:0%
director at the griffin-free public
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
library in auburn new hampshire and i'm
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
here because i oppose the bill
 
01:57:10.709 --> 01:57:10.719 align:start position:0%
we are a small conservative community
 
01:57:12.870 --> 01:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
of 5600 people
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
and like
 
01:57:16.390 --> 01:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
most of new hampshire libraries
 
01:57:20.470 --> 01:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
we are the community center for our town
 
01:57:23.430 --> 01:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
i am the only full-time staff member
 
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
who did get a background check as policy
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
so we're not against that and we
 
01:57:31.109 --> 01:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
understand and are very supportive
 
01:57:33.669 --> 01:57:33.679 align:start position:0%
of the safety of our community
 
01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
my concern with hb 1529
 
01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
is the requirement for library
 
01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
volunteers to obtain and pay for
 
01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens are civically
 
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
minded and proud of it
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
they enjoy volunteering their time to
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
help support and build their communities
 
01:57:54.790 --> 01:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
one example of this for us is we hold an
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
annual book sale
 
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
consisting of 20 000 items which is 25
 
01:58:01.510 --> 01:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
percent bigger than the size of our
 
01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:02.629 align:start position:0%
percent bigger than the size of our
library

01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
library
 
01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's held over four days which is made
 
01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
possible by dozens of community
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
volunteers these are people that we know
 
01:58:12.550 --> 01:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
that are patrons of the library who
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
support their community
 
01:58:16.390 --> 01:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
they are not random people coming in to
 
01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:18.310 align:start position:0%
they are not random people coming in to
volunteer

01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
the majority of volunteers sign up just
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
a couple of days in advance
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
which does not give them enough time to
 
01:58:27.830 --> 01:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
get these background checks
 
01:58:30.550 --> 01:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
in addition auburn residents are known
 
01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
to be extremely frugal and majority of
 
01:58:36.070 --> 01:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
our volunteers are on fixed incomes they
 
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
are proud to volunteer their time
 
01:58:40.709 --> 01:58:40.719 align:start position:0%
but this bill requires them to pay in
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
order to volunteer which places an undue
 
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
burden on them
 
01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:46.639 align:start position:0%
and creates a better barrier to their
 
01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:48.639 align:start position:0%
community involvement
 
01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
and the result is we won't have
 
01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:51.750 align:start position:0%
and the result is we won't have
volunteers

01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
volunteers
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
and as of one person full-time
 
01:58:57.189 --> 01:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
i can't run a community center without
 
01:59:00.149 --> 01:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
my amazing dedicated community members
 
01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
and volunteers this bill is written has
 
01:59:05.189 --> 01:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequence of being
 
01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
detrimental to our operation as a
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
community center and will have a
 
01:59:11.189 --> 01:59:11.199 align:start position:0%
negative impact on our community and our
 
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
volunteers well-being thank you
 
01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you have any questions
 
01:59:18.070 --> 01:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
paul by callum thank you mr chairman and
 
01:59:22.229 --> 01:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
um my question is
 
01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:25.589 align:start position:0%
um my question is
the

01:59:25.589 --> 01:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:59:28.709 --> 01:59:28.719 align:start position:0%
the boundaries of existing state law if
 
01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with them so if i
 
01:59:34.070 --> 01:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
volunteer to be a youth coordinator for
 
01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
your library
 
01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:36.950 align:start position:0%
your library
does

01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:59:39.669 --> 01:59:39.679 align:start position:0%
are there requirements
 
01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
for the state or from the town
 
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
yes so um based on law as i understand
 
01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:47.510 align:start position:0%
yes so um based on law as i understand
it

01:59:47.510 --> 01:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:59:49.109 --> 01:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
you could not volunteer as a youth
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
coordinator i have a person on staff a
 
01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
part-time person that works 10 hours a
 
01:59:57.270 --> 01:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
week they are our children's librarian
 
01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
and because a volunteer cannot do
 
02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
something a staff member does they would
 
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
never do that so the majority of our
 
02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
volunteers you know whether they're
 
02:00:07.830 --> 02:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
moving books or sorting books
 
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
they're not alone with kids they're
 
02:00:12.310 --> 02:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
known to us they are library community
 
02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:19.990 align:start position:0%
known to us they are library community
members

02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.189 --> 02:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
thank you uh and
 
02:00:30.390 --> 02:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
no more questions uh i'll now chair if
 
02:00:33.189 --> 02:00:33.199 align:start position:0%
there are further questions
 
02:00:40.950 --> 02:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:43.109 --> 02:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:00:43.119 --> 02:00:45.109 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:46.149 --> 02:00:46.159 align:start position:0%
would you
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%

02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:52.070 align:start position:0%
could you please
explain

02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
the necessary qualifications and
 
02:00:56.480 --> 02:00:58.149 align:start position:0%
the necessary qualifications and
required

02:00:58.149 --> 02:00:58.159 align:start position:0%
required
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
education for the term director
 
02:01:04.149 --> 02:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
sure i have a masters of science degree
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
from simmons college
 
02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
plus i have 20 plus years experience
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
direct experience being a library
 
02:01:14.070 --> 02:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
director so i have a master's level
 
02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:15.270 align:start position:0%
director so i have a master's level
degree

02:01:15.270 --> 02:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
degree
 
02:01:17.589 --> 02:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
in training as well as
 
02:01:21.189 --> 02:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:23.990 --> 02:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:25.669 --> 02:01:25.679 align:start position:0%
so your
 
02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
master's i'm what i'm asking is not what
 
02:01:31.589 --> 02:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
your education is
 
02:01:35.189 --> 02:01:35.199 align:start position:0%
what is the required education that's
 
02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
the return we have the term director
 
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
i can only speak for my library and for
 
02:01:43.750 --> 02:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
my library it is a master's degree from
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
an american library association
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
accredited institution
 
02:01:50.310 --> 02:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not familiar with a state law that
 
02:01:52.709 --> 02:01:52.719 align:start position:0%
requires that okay
 
02:01:55.669 --> 02:01:55.679 align:start position:0%
follow-up please one more follow-up
 
02:01:55.679 --> 02:01:56.870 align:start position:0%
follow-up please one more follow-up
um

02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:56.880 --> 02:01:58.229 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:01:58.229 --> 02:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:59.589 --> 02:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
could you
 
02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
tell me
 
02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
if there is any reason at all which you
 
02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
would think
 
02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
there would be a requirement
 
02:02:09.990 --> 02:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
for background checks
 
02:02:11.910 --> 02:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
for anyone
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
as an employee i'm not talking about
 
02:02:15.119 --> 02:02:16.629 align:start position:0%
as an employee i'm not talking about
necessarily

02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
02:02:16.639 --> 02:02:18.550 align:start position:0%
necessarily
um

02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:21.270 --> 02:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
people who volunteer i'm talking
 
02:02:24.229 --> 02:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
specifically about an employee of any
 
02:02:26.070 --> 02:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
kind in a library
 
02:02:29.109 --> 02:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
i i have no issue and i
 
02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
as i said our town for full-time
 
02:02:33.910 --> 02:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
employees does do background checks i'm
 
02:02:35.830 --> 02:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
not at issue with doing background
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
checks on employees
 
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
um i i think that that is um a
 
02:02:41.589 --> 02:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
reasonable precaution to take when
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
someone is employed by the by the town
 
02:02:48.390 --> 02:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you so much
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
i appreciate it
 
02:02:59.750 --> 02:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
02:03:04.390 --> 02:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
representing libraries in new hampshire
 
02:03:19.510 --> 02:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
you're not on
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
is that better okay
 
02:03:27.270 --> 02:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for that uh instruction so my
 
02:03:29.669 --> 02:03:29.679 align:start position:0%
name is deborah holdly and i am the
 
02:03:31.350 --> 02:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
library director of the moultonborough
 
02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
public library um the population we
 
02:03:36.310 --> 02:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
serve is about 5 000 however in the
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
summer we
 
02:03:39.830 --> 02:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
triple and sometimes quadruple that
 
02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:40.950 align:start position:0%
triple and sometimes quadruple that
amount

02:03:40.950 --> 02:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
amount
 
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
there is a significant portion of our
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
population who are retired and they make
 
02:03:47.830 --> 02:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
up a large portion of our dedicated
 
02:03:50.470 --> 02:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
volunteer corps at the library
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
there is a strong sense of community
 
02:03:55.430 --> 02:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
pride and philanthropic spirit in
 
02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:56.870 align:start position:0%
pride and philanthropic spirit in
moultonborough

02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
moultonborough
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
the the library is known for its
 
02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
community engagement and we have a
 
02:04:03.189 --> 02:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
strong support for the library one of
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
the ways that people do show their
 
02:04:07.750 --> 02:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
support is to volunteer to help with
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
services programs landscaping and
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
as our previous speaker our annual book
 
02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:14.950 align:start position:0%
as our previous speaker our annual book
sale

02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
sale
 
02:04:17.189 --> 02:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
we rely on these individuals and putting
 
02:04:19.510 --> 02:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
barriers to volunteer will compromise
 
02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
the library services we provide
 
02:04:24.069 --> 02:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
as a small library the process of
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
federal background checks would be
 
02:04:29.030 --> 02:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
cumbersome and require significant staff
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
time to prepare process and review all
 
02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
the applications for the amount of
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
volunteers we have
 
02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:35.830 align:start position:0%
volunteers we have
also

02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:04:37.350 --> 02:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
due to the nature of some of our
 
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
volunteer opportunities the background
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
checks would not be completed in time
 
02:04:43.750 --> 02:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
for us to bring them on board especially
 
02:04:45.990 --> 02:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
those arriving in the summer months and
 
02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
only staying for the season that is our
 
02:04:49.990 --> 02:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
busiest time and that's when we need the
 
02:04:51.669 --> 02:04:51.679 align:start position:0%
most volunteers
 
02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
so i thank you today for listening to my
 
02:04:56.470 --> 02:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
concerns and testimony as to why i
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
oppose house bill 1529
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
02:05:01.679 --> 02:05:04.870 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
questions

02:05:04.870 --> 02:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:07.910 --> 02:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again thank you um
 
02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
i'll make one comment one of the reasons
 
02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
we're very eager to make sure the
 
02:05:15.030 --> 02:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
microphone's picking you up well is all
 
02:05:16.629 --> 02:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
of these hearings
 
02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
are on youtube
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
and they're actually closed captioning
 
02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
the hearings as well so it's very
 
02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
important that everybody be clearly
 
02:05:25.510 --> 02:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
understood for the
 
02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
ais over at the
 
02:05:29.350 --> 02:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
google palace
 
02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:30.470 align:start position:0%
google palace
um

02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
next up
 
02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
i will uh ask denise van zanten and
 
02:05:37.750 --> 02:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully i got that right
 
02:05:39.270 --> 02:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire library
 
02:05:41.669 --> 02:05:41.679 align:start position:0%
association speaking in opposition to
 
02:05:50.149 --> 02:05:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
get on
 
02:05:54.229 --> 02:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
ah red light got it thank you my name is
 
02:05:57.350 --> 02:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
denise manzan i am the current president
 
02:05:59.510 --> 02:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire library association
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
and i'm also the director of the
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
manchester city library
 
02:06:04.950 --> 02:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
i do support background checks we've
 
02:06:06.069 --> 02:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
been doing background checks at the
 
02:06:07.990 --> 02:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
manchester city library the state checks
 
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
on all volunteers and our employees
 
02:06:12.149 --> 02:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
since i took over as director
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
however as you know new hampshire
 
02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
libraries pride themselves on providing
 
02:06:17.830 --> 02:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
a welcoming and safe environment for our
 
02:06:20.229 --> 02:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
community members and to do so many of
 
02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
our libraries already do the state
 
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
background check
 
02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
and all of this guidance falls under our
 
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
library board of trustees library board
 
02:06:30.550 --> 02:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
of trustees make the decision as to what
 
02:06:32.870 --> 02:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
the hiring practices are going to be and
 
02:06:34.629 --> 02:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
most of them follow what their town or
 
02:06:36.629 --> 02:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
city is doing
 
02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
they had cost and time to administer a
 
02:06:41.589 --> 02:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
federal background check which i spoke
 
02:06:44.470 --> 02:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
to my city security manager about and
 
02:06:46.870 --> 02:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
they take two to three months
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
where it's one to two weeks of the state
 
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
background checks right now and
 
02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
the cost of the city was more for this
 
02:06:54.400 --> 02:06:57.350 align:start position:0%
the cost of the city was more for this
check

02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
but my real concern as the library
 
02:07:00.950 --> 02:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
association president is most of our
 
02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
libraries serve populations under 7 500
 
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
people so they are very small
 
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
very different from manchester
 
02:07:10.950 --> 02:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
and they rely as we all do on our
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
neighbors to support many important
 
02:07:17.589 --> 02:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
services at our libraries in the state
 
02:07:19.510 --> 02:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
and while the bill allows us to put that
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
cost onto the employee or the volunteer
 
02:07:25.830 --> 02:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
i do feel as my colleagues do that this
 
02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
does impact the good will
 
02:07:30.149 --> 02:07:30.159 align:start position:0%
and the community spirit in our in our
 
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
communities and the support for the
 
02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:33.589 align:start position:0%
communities and the support for the
libraries

02:07:33.589 --> 02:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
libraries
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
so i thank you for listening
 
02:07:37.910 --> 02:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
to me today and for your service to our
 
02:07:40.229 --> 02:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
state's constituents
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that testimony
 
02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
are there questions representative
 
02:07:43.760 --> 02:07:45.430 align:start position:0%
are there questions representative
turcotte

02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
turcotte
 
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you for
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
the question i should ask this of the
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor but i didn't so maybe you
 
02:07:52.470 --> 02:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
know the answer what's the approximate
 
02:07:54.629 --> 02:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
cost of a background check
 
02:07:56.550 --> 02:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
i was told the federal background check
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
for the city of manchester is 48 dollars
 
02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
and 50 cents
 
02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
and that's coming from a previous police
 
02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
officer who deals with department of
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
safety regularly so i i don't know
 
02:08:14.310 --> 02:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
that's what i was told follow-up yeah
 
02:08:15.750 --> 02:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
just make sure i heard you correctly
 
02:08:18.870 --> 02:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
48.50 would be for a full-time employee
 
02:08:23.109 --> 02:08:23.119 align:start position:0%
20 for volunteers thank you
 
02:08:27.189 --> 02:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:30.149 --> 02:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
 
02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
is it safe to say that you would be in
 
02:08:35.830 --> 02:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
favor of background checks as long as
 
02:08:39.030 --> 02:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
they are paid for by the community
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
i am in favor of the state background
 
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
checks the federal background checks are
 
02:08:46.149 --> 02:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
very labor intensive and require a lot
 
02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
more work
 
02:08:49.430 --> 02:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
and i was also told that it does not
 
02:08:51.189 --> 02:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
cover the whole country because some
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
states have privacy laws and do not
 
02:08:54.550 --> 02:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
share that information
 
02:08:58.149 --> 02:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
again from my city security manager
 
02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:03.030 --> 02:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:08.229 --> 02:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
if you can help me understand you said
 
02:09:11.109 --> 02:09:11.119 align:start position:0%
that city of manchester's library does
 
02:09:15.669 --> 02:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
have a policy of checks on volunteers
 
02:09:17.270 --> 02:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:18.950 align:start position:0%
is that
universal

02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
universal
 
02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:20.390 align:start position:0%
universal
um

02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
or is this so earlier someone mentioned
 
02:09:25.589 --> 02:09:25.599 align:start position:0%
like the one-day volunteer who stands
 
02:09:27.750 --> 02:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
outside is it every does it cover
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
everyone or is there a scope so at my
 
02:09:33.109 --> 02:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
library um we do background checks state
 
02:09:35.350 --> 02:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
background checks on all employees and
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
on our volunteers
 
02:09:38.950 --> 02:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
so we do have to plan in advance for
 
02:09:40.229 --> 02:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
certain things
 
02:09:42.709 --> 02:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
and i do have a lot more staff
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
and i have a city security manager who
 
02:09:46.950 --> 02:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
actually takes care of taking the checks
 
02:09:48.870 --> 02:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
and doing all the processing for me so
 
02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not your typical new hampshire
 
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
library and our trustees do set the
 
02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:56.069 align:start position:0%
library and our trustees do set the
policies

02:09:56.069 --> 02:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:57.430 --> 02:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:10:00.229 --> 02:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
any further questions seeing none thank
 
02:10:03.109 --> 02:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you very much
 
02:10:06.629 --> 02:10:06.639 align:start position:0%
um next up i have a card from katherine
 
02:10:09.189 --> 02:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
heck i believe
 
02:10:09.199 --> 02:10:09.990 align:start position:0%
heck i believe
from

02:10:09.990 --> 02:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:10:13.030 --> 02:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association in
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
good morning committee members my name
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
is catherine heck from the new hampshire
 
02:10:25.830 --> 02:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
municipal association and we are here to
 
02:10:28.069 --> 02:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill as well i don't want to
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
be redundant in any of the testimony
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
that you've heard directly from our
 
02:10:33.990 --> 02:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
public librarians however i did want to
 
02:10:36.229 --> 02:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
bring forward that many of our member
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
libraries conduct background checks for
 
02:10:41.109 --> 02:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
all of their employees full or part-time
 
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
and for some of their regular volunteers
 
02:10:45.030 --> 02:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
that's a standard practice because
 
02:10:47.669 --> 02:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
they're regular volunteers we do feel
 
02:10:50.149 --> 02:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
that this bill will hamper a local
 
02:10:53.669 --> 02:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
library's ability to plan programs for
 
02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
speakers a one-time speaker perhaps
 
02:10:58.709 --> 02:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
activities or some of the events that
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
you heard about in previous testimony in
 
02:11:03.430 --> 02:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
addition to the cost associated with
 
02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
that as many volunteers may or may not
 
02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
be open to paying to have to volunteer
 
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
i also want to express that 153 of our
 
02:11:15.510 --> 02:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
communities in new hampshire have a
 
02:11:18.390 --> 02:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
population of under 5 000 so that's a
 
02:11:20.629 --> 02:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
significant number of public libraries
 
02:11:22.830 --> 02:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
that rely heavily on our
 
02:11:26.149 --> 02:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
volunteer personnel in order to move
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
forward their mission and serve their
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
community so i can take any questions
 
02:11:31.109 --> 02:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
that you might have
 
02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions
 
02:11:37.990 --> 02:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:42.550 --> 02:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
would you as a municipal
 
02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:47.910 align:start position:0%
would you as a municipal
representative

02:11:47.910 --> 02:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
see any circumstances under which
 
02:11:53.990 --> 02:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
you would actually support this and any
 
02:11:57.750 --> 02:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
i would have to really go back to our
 
02:12:01.589 --> 02:12:01.599 align:start position:0%
members and and see
 
02:12:01.599 --> 02:12:02.390 align:start position:0%
members and and see
what

02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:12:04.069 --> 02:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
what we might be able to do to amend
 
02:12:06.629 --> 02:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
this bill to perhaps accomplish the
 
02:12:09.189 --> 02:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor's intent and make sure that our
 
02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
local libraries can continue to function
 
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
so i would have to defer and have input
 
02:12:16.550 --> 02:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
from our stakeholders sir
 
02:12:18.790 --> 02:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
02:12:20.470 --> 02:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
so when you say you would have to go to
 
02:12:22.550 --> 02:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
your members
 
02:12:26.310 --> 02:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
um let me divulge my position i am also
 
02:12:29.990 --> 02:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
a selectmen for the town of unity
 
02:12:32.629 --> 02:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
we are member organization
 
02:12:34.750 --> 02:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
does that mean you're going to ask every
 
02:12:37.430 --> 02:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
municipality would you send a letter to
 
02:12:39.990 --> 02:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
or a communique or a phone call or
 
02:12:41.669 --> 02:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
something to the selectmen of the town
 
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
of unity to let us know
 
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
that you want our input
 
02:12:50.709 --> 02:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
um i would have to say most likely not
 
02:12:52.950 --> 02:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
we've taken a position of opposition to
 
02:12:55.109 --> 02:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
this bill based on our policies that we
 
02:12:56.709 --> 02:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
already have in place that all of our
 
02:12:59.669 --> 02:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
members including unity have developed
 
02:13:02.229 --> 02:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
however we would work with particularly
 
02:13:05.030 --> 02:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
the libraries to see how we could make
 
02:13:07.990 --> 02:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
palatable to everybody if that were the
 
02:13:10.159 --> 02:13:12.390 align:start position:0%
palatable to everybody if that were the
case

02:13:12.390 --> 02:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:13:14.709 --> 02:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:13:17.030 --> 02:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:23.280 align:start position:0%

representing nhlta
 
02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
in opposition position to the bill and
 
02:13:38.390 --> 02:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you very much i'm

marcia mclaughlin
 
02:13:43.510 --> 02:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
i'm here
 
02:13:46.149 --> 02:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
one as the chair of my
 
02:13:48.709 --> 02:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
library board of trustees in greenland
 
02:13:52.229 --> 02:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
at the weeks public library and speaking
 
02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
today as the president of the new
 
02:13:57.589 --> 02:13:57.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire library trustees association
 
02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
in opposition of this bill
 
02:14:00.079 --> 02:14:01.669 align:start position:0%
in opposition of this bill
and

02:14:01.669 --> 02:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:14:04.149 --> 02:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
i very first have to say i'm hoping that
 
02:14:06.310 --> 02:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
you all will all vote to make this
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate in its current
 
02:14:09.119 --> 02:14:10.950 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate in its current
form

02:14:10.950 --> 02:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
form
 
02:14:13.830 --> 02:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
i'd begin by asking why
 
02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
i did hear representatives loves
 
02:14:20.069 --> 02:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
reference to what caused him to draw up
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
this particular bill
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
but beyond that i don't know what the
 
02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
problem is that you are trying to fix
 
02:14:29.669 --> 02:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
with this particular bill
 
02:14:31.350 --> 02:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to reiterate the points
 
02:14:33.510 --> 02:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
that have already been made in any time
 
02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:34.550 align:start position:0%
that have already been made in any time
of

02:14:34.550 --> 02:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:14:36.790 --> 02:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
depth by other people who have spoken in
 
02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:38.069 align:start position:0%
depth by other people who have spoken in
opposition

02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
most of the libraries in new hampshire
 
02:14:42.790 --> 02:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
already do the
 
02:14:45.669 --> 02:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
background checks for their employees
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
not necessarily for the volunteers
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's on an individual basis the
 
02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
library trustees have that within their
 
02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
discretion both on the the background
 
02:15:02.149 --> 02:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:04.790 --> 02:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
they've spoken about volunteerism and i
 
02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
i can only um ditto that that the impact
 
02:15:11.189 --> 02:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
that would be made on volunteerism by
 
02:15:13.350 --> 02:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
this bill if you require
 
02:15:16.870 --> 02:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
the background check one
 
02:15:20.149 --> 02:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
i can speak personally about hiring a
 
02:15:23.030 --> 02:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
new library director this past summer
 
02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
we made and i will refer to that in my
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
third point we made a conditional office
 
02:15:29.750 --> 02:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
of employment
 
02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
to our new director
 
02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
and it took eight weeks
 
02:15:38.069 --> 02:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
in order for us to do both the local and
 
02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:15:41.430 --> 02:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
federal background check i
 
02:15:43.270 --> 02:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
was very impressed when representative
 
02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
love referred to a 10 minute
 
02:15:47.589 --> 02:15:47.599 align:start position:0%
i'd love to know where that was done
 
02:15:50.550 --> 02:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
that you could get that done but it in
 
02:15:52.870 --> 02:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
in that it goes to
 
02:15:54.950 --> 02:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
stated in the bill
 
02:15:58.709 --> 02:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
that the conditional offer of employment
 
02:16:00.229 --> 02:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
as i said many
 
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
mine is not the only library that has
 
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
experienced lengthy delays in being able
 
02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
to bring staff on board
 
02:16:07.679 --> 02:16:09.030 align:start position:0%
to bring staff on board
that

02:16:09.030 --> 02:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:12.470 --> 02:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
making an offer of employment does not
 
02:16:14.709 --> 02:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
mean that the person who has been
 
02:16:17.189 --> 02:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
offered the job can automatically begin
 
02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
working in our case it was you had to
 
02:16:22.149 --> 02:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
have the background jet
 
02:16:25.669 --> 02:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
check completed before we could bring
 
02:16:28.069 --> 02:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
you on staff which is understandable i
 
02:16:30.390 --> 02:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
think that that's what you all mr love
 
02:16:32.309 --> 02:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
is seeking to have happen is that they
 
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
don't begin working until you know
 
02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:36.870 align:start position:0%
don't begin working until you know
um

02:16:36.870 --> 02:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:39.990 --> 02:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
and having these delays as i said in our
 
02:16:43.750 --> 02:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
case it really put a very uh
 
02:16:46.230 --> 02:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
deep hardship on our staff again we're a
 
02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
small community
 
02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
four thousand people we have seven
 
02:16:53.110 --> 02:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
library employees only two full-time and
 
02:16:56.469 --> 02:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
and um five part-time so we were short
 
02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
one full-time fully vested
 
02:17:00.629 --> 02:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
employee for that
 
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
actually from june through the end of
 
02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:04.389 align:start position:0%
actually from june through the end of
september

02:17:04.389 --> 02:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
september
 
02:17:07.429 --> 02:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
so i just go back to my my original
 
02:17:09.830 --> 02:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
question which is why
 
02:17:12.309 --> 02:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
what are we trying to fix that that that
 
02:17:12.319 --> 02:17:13.669 align:start position:0%
what are we trying to fix that that that
exists

02:17:13.669 --> 02:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
exists
 
02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to take any questions
 
02:17:17.429 --> 02:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
02:17:19.990 --> 02:17:20.000 align:start position:0%

02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again thank you
 
02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
very much that was the last card i had
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
was there anybody else who was planning
 
02:17:28.230 --> 02:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
i don't see any so i'll once again turn
 
02:17:36.709 --> 02:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:38.469 --> 02:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
it's actually my fault and then i pass
 
02:17:39.910 --> 02:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
it on to you i know what i'm doing i
 
02:17:41.669 --> 02:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
have air i have errands show up just
 
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
looking for me so i can walk out
 
02:17:47.589 --> 02:17:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:54.309 --> 02:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
and call representative brody the shanes
 
02:17:54.319 --> 02:17:55.030 align:start position:0%
and call representative brody the shanes
to

02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:03.589 --> 02:18:03.599 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:18:04.549 --> 02:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
to the committee for letting me
 
02:18:07.190 --> 02:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
introduce house bill 1508 prohibiting
 
02:18:09.429 --> 02:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
the discharge of volunteer firefighters
 
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
or volunteer emergency medical
 
02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
technicians from other employment
 
02:18:16.230 --> 02:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 1508 is a bipartisan bill
 
02:18:18.709 --> 02:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
that protects an employee that protects
 
02:18:20.790 --> 02:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
an employee from districts that
 
02:18:23.349 --> 02:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
prohibits an employer from discharging
 
02:18:25.509 --> 02:18:25.519 align:start position:0%
or disciplining an employee who is a
 
02:18:27.509 --> 02:18:27.519 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighter emergency medical
 
02:18:29.750 --> 02:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
technician whose failure to report for
 
02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
work was due to the employee responding
 
02:18:34.469 --> 02:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
to an emergency the bill was formulated
 
02:18:36.309 --> 02:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
with the office of legislative services
 
02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
using language from maine's and
 
02:18:39.270 --> 02:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
massachusetts laws that protect
 
02:18:41.589 --> 02:18:41.599 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighters and emts who are
 
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
late to their day jobs because of an
 
02:18:45.669 --> 02:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
emergency call bill was requested by a
 
02:18:46.950 --> 02:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
constituent who is a volunteer
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
firefighter the constituent explained to
 
02:18:50.709 --> 02:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
me that the recruitment of volunteer
 
02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
firefighters has been extremely
 
02:18:53.669 --> 02:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
difficult for many of new hampshire's
 
02:18:55.830 --> 02:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
communities especially in rural areas
 
02:18:57.589 --> 02:18:57.599 align:start position:0%
one concern many potential recruits
 
02:18:59.270 --> 02:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
raise is possible conflicts with their
 
02:19:01.110 --> 02:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
work hours they have a concern that if
 
02:19:03.110 --> 02:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
they get called if they're on a call you
 
02:19:04.709 --> 02:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
know there's specific times where these
 
02:19:06.629 --> 02:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
folks can be taught called in and that
 
02:19:08.709 --> 02:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
if they take those specific times to be
 
02:19:11.110 --> 02:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
called in that um if an emergency lasts
 
02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
longer than anticipated it makes so then
 
02:19:15.429 --> 02:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
they uh you know go past that amount of
 
02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
allotted call time where they kind of
 
02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
work and balance out their work schedule
 
02:19:20.150 --> 02:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
that they could end up being late and
 
02:19:22.629 --> 02:19:22.639 align:start position:0%
that could lead to discipline or
 
02:19:24.870 --> 02:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
being passed on future
 
02:19:26.629 --> 02:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
opportunities at their current place of
 
02:19:29.990 --> 02:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
work like promotions or raises
 
02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:31.030 align:start position:0%
work like promotions or raises
um

02:19:31.030 --> 02:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:33.990 --> 02:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
so this is a it's a huge concern for uh
 
02:19:37.030 --> 02:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
for folks who want to be involved want
 
02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
to help their communities want to serve
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
their communities but feel as if that it
 
02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
would conflict with their professional
 
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
work and their their future
 
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
economic opportunities 1508 is also a
 
02:19:51.110 --> 02:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
public safety bill with a shortage of
 
02:19:52.950 --> 02:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighters
 
02:19:54.870 --> 02:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
part-time or volunteer emts across the
 
02:19:56.790 --> 02:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
state especially in rural areas doing
 
02:19:58.389 --> 02:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
anything we can do to help recruit and
 
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
retain vital public safety
 
02:20:04.309 --> 02:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
public seat oh wow hello
 
02:20:04.319 --> 02:20:06.550 align:start position:0%
public seat oh wow hello
oh

02:20:06.550 --> 02:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:20:09.990 --> 02:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess i'm cursed i don't know
 
02:20:12.150 --> 02:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
can yeah can you hear me
 
02:20:14.830 --> 02:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
okay we'll go with this for now then
 
02:20:17.349 --> 02:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
um where was i
 
02:20:18.630 --> 02:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's essential for all of us to have
 
02:20:21.030 --> 02:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
these public safety workers and these
 
02:20:29.110 --> 02:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:51.030 align:start position:0%
 
hello

02:20:51.030 --> 02:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:59.190 --> 02:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
hello

02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:28.150 --> 02:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
hello oh i can't oh there we go look at
 
02:21:41.429 --> 02:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:43.030 --> 02:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
all right i'll i'll i'm going to repeat
 
02:21:44.710 --> 02:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
my last point in case the people in line
 
02:21:46.469 --> 02:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear me so um
 
02:21:48.870 --> 02:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's a public safety bill uh these folks
 
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
they're it's important that we retain
 
02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
and recruit volunteer firefighters
 
02:21:53.910 --> 02:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
especially with the shortage that we
 
02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
have in a number of communities across
 
02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's essential for our safety and it's
 
02:22:01.110 --> 02:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
essential to protect people's lives and
 
02:22:03.510 --> 02:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
property with life without them life
 
02:22:05.429 --> 02:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
would be much much more difficult should
 
02:22:07.030 --> 02:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
also note the new hampshire fire chiefs
 
02:22:08.469 --> 02:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
association is supportive of this
 
02:22:10.469 --> 02:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
legislation they recognize how the bill
 
02:22:11.910 --> 02:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
will improve recruitment and public
 
02:22:14.070 --> 02:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
safety in their communities well lastly
 
02:22:16.070 --> 02:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
comment on the fiscal note in a very
 
02:22:17.270 --> 02:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
roundabout way the fiscal note
 
02:22:18.389 --> 02:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
essentially says the cost of the
 
02:22:20.550 --> 02:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers is next to zero there may be
 
02:22:22.950 --> 02:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
some cost for litigation in the court
 
02:22:24.710 --> 02:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
system but that seemed to be
 
02:22:27.670 --> 02:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
um the only feasible increase explained
 
02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note i think the new
 
02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:30.070 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note i think the new
hampshire

02:22:30.070 --> 02:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:22:32.309 --> 02:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
um municipal association or some other
 
02:22:34.389 --> 02:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
organization might have mentioned or
 
02:22:36.230 --> 02:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
maybe towns or something that they would
 
02:22:38.469 --> 02:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
have to work people's schedules around
 
02:22:39.990 --> 02:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
and that might have some perceived cost
 
02:22:41.830 --> 02:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
because a lot of public employees are
 
02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
also volunteer firefighters but i think
 
02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's a cost that they would probably
 
02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
be able to easily incur so
 
02:22:51.670 --> 02:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
with that i will take any questions on
 
02:22:58.230 --> 02:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:00.550 --> 02:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
02:23:03.270 --> 02:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
as as i read this um it appears that the
 
02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:04.469 align:start position:0%
as as i read this um it appears that the
only

02:23:04.469 --> 02:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
um instance where an employee would be
 
02:23:10.070 --> 02:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
protected would be in showing up late
 
02:23:12.309 --> 02:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't appear unless i'm reading
 
02:23:14.710 --> 02:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
it incorrectly that if someone left work
 
02:23:16.870 --> 02:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
in the middle of a shift in order to
 
02:23:19.990 --> 02:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
respond to a emergency or if they left
 
02:23:23.270 --> 02:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
early um before their shift was over uh
 
02:23:24.550 --> 02:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
does not appear that they will be
 
02:23:25.990 --> 02:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
protected in that instance is that
 
02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:26.870 align:start position:0%
protected in that instance is that
correct

02:23:26.870 --> 02:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:23:28.309 --> 02:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
um to my understanding where the bill is
 
02:23:30.070 --> 02:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
written correct they also need to get a
 
02:23:32.070 --> 02:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
note from a fire chief so from the fire
 
02:23:33.750 --> 02:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
chief that they serve under to show that
 
02:23:36.070 --> 02:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
you know that they actually um that they
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
actually were being called that they're
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
coming back from a duty call the reason
 
02:23:42.550 --> 02:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
why we didn't do it so then it was um
 
02:23:43.590 --> 02:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
they were leaving the middle of their
 
02:23:45.510 --> 02:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
work shift was because there's kind of
 
02:23:47.910 --> 02:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
an expectation where when you choose
 
02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
your shifts that you're on duty right
 
02:23:51.590 --> 02:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
that you can be called in that you would
 
02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
work that around your work schedule how
 
02:23:54.870 --> 02:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
it currently exists
 
02:23:57.510 --> 02:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
so we didn't want to be too stringent on
 
02:23:58.950 --> 02:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
employers to make it so that people were
 
02:24:00.550 --> 02:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
scheduling full eight-hour work days and
 
02:24:02.710 --> 02:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
saying well i'm on call and you know if
 
02:24:04.870 --> 02:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
i have to leave for theoretically you
 
02:24:06.550 --> 02:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
know three hours of that call or four
 
02:24:09.349 --> 02:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
hours of sorry of my you know day shift
 
02:24:11.110 --> 02:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
that you know you're you're just gonna
 
02:24:12.150 --> 02:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
have to deal with it and try to find
 
02:24:13.349 --> 02:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
other help that would seem a little bit
 
02:24:14.469 --> 02:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
too stringent when there's a labor
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
shortage for everyone so the idea was
 
02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
just to try to make it so there's some
 
02:24:20.309 --> 02:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
basic protections for folks who have the
 
02:24:21.830 --> 02:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
uncontrollable thing where they're in
 
02:24:23.110 --> 02:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
the last hour of their kind of their
 
02:24:24.710 --> 02:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
duty shift that they're called to and
 
02:24:25.990 --> 02:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
they end up you know having to do a
 
02:24:27.590 --> 02:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
two-hour call and they're an hour late
 
02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
for work that there's no kind of
 
02:24:29.990 --> 02:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
repercussions because they were doing
 
02:24:31.270 --> 02:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
something that's important for keeping
 
02:24:39.110 --> 02:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:41.030 --> 02:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:24:42.870 --> 02:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
introducing your bill
 
02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
my question is to clarify the language
 
02:24:49.270 --> 02:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
says no employer do you mean that of any
 
02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
size down to the employer of a single
 
02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:54.070 align:start position:0%
size down to the employer of a single
employee

02:24:54.070 --> 02:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
employee
 
02:24:56.790 --> 02:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh which line is that uh five
 
02:24:58.710 --> 02:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
line five thank you oh the very first
 
02:25:00.870 --> 02:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
line thank you okay no employer yeah i
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
mean i think the way employers written
 
02:25:03.990 --> 02:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
into the bill to my understanding is
 
02:25:07.110 --> 02:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
employers anyone who's employed so i
 
02:25:08.710 --> 02:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
think that would be anyone who you know
 
02:25:10.230 --> 02:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
they have a w-2 with any business
 
02:25:12.469 --> 02:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
whether it's the state government county
 
02:25:14.309 --> 02:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
government local government or any other
 
02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:19.270 --> 02:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative mandeville followed by
 
02:25:21.030 --> 02:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative warden
 
02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:25:23.830 --> 02:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
02:25:26.230 --> 02:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
testimony i i was going to ask the
 
02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
question that representative sullivan
 
02:25:30.389 --> 02:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
did about the distinction um
 
02:25:32.389 --> 02:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
and i and your answer was quite clear
 
02:25:35.590 --> 02:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
i'd refer though to the methodologies
 
02:25:38.790 --> 02:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
methodology section which talks about
 
02:25:40.710 --> 02:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
the need to leave work in addition to
 
02:25:43.030 --> 02:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
failure report work that's just the
 
02:25:45.270 --> 02:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
methodology but if you do look then at
 
02:25:47.190 --> 02:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
the bill text itself
 
02:25:50.710 --> 02:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
in the first line of section two
 
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
in the definition of responding to an
 
02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
emergency it means responding to
 
02:25:58.710 --> 02:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
leaving work to respond to and that
 
02:26:01.349 --> 02:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
still gave me a little bit of confusion
 
02:26:03.990 --> 02:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
about the distinction between
 
02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:05.510 align:start position:0%
about the distinction between
um

02:26:05.510 --> 02:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
not turning up because you were on a
 
02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:09.110 align:start position:0%
not turning up because you were on a
call

02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
call
 
02:26:11.990 --> 02:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
or leaving because one occurred when you
 
02:26:13.590 --> 02:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
were at work could you
 
02:26:15.990 --> 02:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
just clarify that i beg your pardon what
 
02:26:17.510 --> 02:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
line are you talking about i'm sorry uh
 
02:26:21.510 --> 02:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
the first line of um
 
02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
section two
 
02:26:24.790 --> 02:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
okay yep i see that section two yeah i
 
02:26:26.230 --> 02:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
think actually i think i'm mistaken
 
02:26:27.830 --> 02:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
there was a couple of um editions of
 
02:26:30.550 --> 02:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
this build that we had written and um
 
02:26:32.309 --> 02:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
i think my my memory served me
 
02:26:34.389 --> 02:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
incorrectly i was operating um and i
 
02:26:36.309 --> 02:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
introduced a different version that i
 
02:26:37.510 --> 02:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
had written over the summer i think
 
02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
you're correct though that um this bill
 
02:26:41.429 --> 02:26:41.439 align:start position:0%
would include also responding to
 
02:26:43.030 --> 02:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
emergencies while someone's on the job
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:52.070 --> 02:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and thanks for bringing this
 
02:26:53.429 --> 02:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
bill to us
 
02:26:55.349 --> 02:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
question on
 
02:26:55.359 --> 02:26:56.469 align:start position:0%
question on
line

02:26:56.469 --> 02:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:26:56.479 --> 02:26:57.990 align:start position:0%
line
22

02:26:57.990 --> 02:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
22
 
02:27:00.469 --> 02:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
you said that somebody's a volunteer
 
02:27:02.750 --> 02:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
unless he or she has worked
 
02:27:06.710 --> 02:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
975 hours in the last six months
 
02:27:08.309 --> 02:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
is that an arbitrary figure you came up
 
02:27:10.309 --> 02:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
with or is it consistent with other
 
02:27:12.309 --> 02:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
statute or labor law
 
02:27:14.070 --> 02:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
and how did you get that number i think
 
02:27:16.070 --> 02:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
um if i'm not mistaken it's i can't
 
02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
remember which statute but it's based on
 
02:27:19.190 --> 02:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
the statute from other states from one
 
02:27:20.389 --> 02:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
of our neighboring states either maine
 
02:27:21.910 --> 02:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
or massachusetts
 
02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:23.270 align:start position:0%
or massachusetts
um

02:27:23.270 --> 02:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:25.830 --> 02:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh the fire chiefs association had no
 
02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
opposition to the way that was written
 
02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
in their understanding but i would be
 
02:27:31.190 --> 02:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
open to an amendment if it doesn't make
 
02:27:32.630 --> 02:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
sense with our current state laws with
 
02:27:37.590 --> 02:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:38.790 --> 02:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
president of warden what were you
 
02:27:41.270 --> 02:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:51.429 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:54.150 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
representative

02:27:54.150 --> 02:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:27:57.630 --> 02:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
um i too have a question on 21 and 22
 
02:28:00.469 --> 02:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
975 hours over a preceding six-month
 
02:28:04.710 --> 02:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
period would make them a full-time um
 
02:28:07.349 --> 02:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
classify them as full-time position
 
02:28:10.710 --> 02:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:12.150 --> 02:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i think that's why it says
 
02:28:13.830 --> 02:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
but shall not include any person to
 
02:28:15.990 --> 02:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
receive compensation for over nine like
 
02:28:17.670 --> 02:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
it's not including those people so if
 
02:28:19.030 --> 02:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
someone's worked
 
02:28:24.070 --> 02:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
so 974 hours they would be covered under
 
02:28:28.550 --> 02:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
this section
 
02:28:30.070 --> 02:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
the way it's written currently yes
 
02:28:31.990 --> 02:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
correct and one last question mr
 
02:28:34.630 --> 02:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
chairman follow up um thank you line 18
 
02:28:36.550 --> 02:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
to 19 where the emergency occurs during
 
02:28:38.389 --> 02:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
a period other than normal working hours
 
02:28:40.630 --> 02:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
of the employee
 
02:28:43.349 --> 02:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
again comes to into the fact that are we
 
02:28:45.190 --> 02:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
looking to have them be
 
02:28:47.510 --> 02:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
able to leave their job be late to their
 
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
job leave their job early
 
02:28:51.590 --> 02:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't
 
02:28:53.910 --> 02:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
it looks like they can do anything they
 
02:28:55.510 --> 02:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
want as a volunteer firefighter with
 
02:28:58.309 --> 02:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
their full-time position somewhere else
 
02:28:59.429 --> 02:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that we're
 
02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
clear clarifying that for the employees
 
02:29:03.910 --> 02:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
that would be reading this
 
02:29:05.590 --> 02:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean um i think i would be
 
02:29:07.590 --> 02:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
definitely open to an amendment where um
 
02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
there could be some changes to section
 
02:29:11.670 --> 02:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
two because i can see that as a sticking
 
02:29:13.750 --> 02:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
point especially to remember many
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
private employers
 
02:29:17.429 --> 02:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
right but um let me just read those
 
02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
lines again you said 18 and 19
 
02:29:27.030 --> 02:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:28.150 --> 02:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i can definitely see the
 
02:29:29.990 --> 02:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
discrepancy there with um the overall
 
02:29:31.910 --> 02:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill so i'd be open to an
 
02:29:37.590 --> 02:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:39.349 --> 02:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for the
 
02:29:42.389 --> 02:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
testimony the question i have is i i
 
02:29:47.349 --> 02:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:50.790 --> 02:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
beneficial to recruitment
 
02:29:54.070 --> 02:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
but could you tell me on a say an
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
annualized basis in the state of new
 
02:29:55.760 --> 02:29:57.270 align:start position:0%
annualized basis in the state of new
hampshire

02:29:57.270 --> 02:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:29:59.429 --> 02:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
how many firefighters or medical techs
 
02:30:01.110 --> 02:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
have been discharged
 
02:30:04.070 --> 02:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
or received disciplinary action by an
 
02:30:04.080 --> 02:30:05.990 align:start position:0%
or received disciplinary action by an
employer

02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
employer
 
02:30:07.590 --> 02:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
no because we don't collect any data on
 
02:30:11.349 --> 02:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:12.389 --> 02:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:30:12.399 --> 02:30:13.910 align:start position:0%
thank you
fault

02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
fault
 
02:30:15.670 --> 02:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any situations where
 
02:30:17.429 --> 02:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
this has actually occurred
 
02:30:19.990 --> 02:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any specific examples
 
02:30:22.469 --> 02:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
however i have um i spoke to this
 
02:30:24.150 --> 02:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
specific firefighter who then introduced
 
02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
me to some other folks that he had tried
 
02:30:28.230 --> 02:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
to recruit who raised this concern as to
 
02:30:29.910 --> 02:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
a reason why they didn't decide to
 
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
volunteer right they had busy work
 
02:30:34.790 --> 02:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
schedules that they were worried as if
 
02:30:37.030 --> 02:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
um if they were late to work that that
 
02:30:38.790 --> 02:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
would end up creating disciplinary
 
02:30:40.389 --> 02:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
actions at their workplace whether or
 
02:30:42.230 --> 02:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
not those were you know legitimate
 
02:30:44.309 --> 02:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
concerns that they had that's a you know
 
02:30:45.670 --> 02:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's something that i could say would
 
02:30:47.429 --> 02:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
maybe be up for debate but it was a
 
02:30:49.910 --> 02:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
concern for volunteer firefighters well
 
02:30:51.990 --> 02:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
potential recruits who decided that they
 
02:30:53.110 --> 02:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
didn't want to become volunteer
 
02:30:53.120 --> 02:30:59.110 align:start position:0%
didn't want to become volunteer
firefighters

02:30:59.110 --> 02:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:01.990 --> 02:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh can you hear me
 
02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:02.870 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh can you hear me
yes

02:31:02.870 --> 02:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:31:02.880 --> 02:31:03.910 align:start position:0%
yes
um

02:31:03.910 --> 02:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:06.389 --> 02:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking uh my question
 
02:31:09.510 --> 02:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh discipli uh if an employer
 
02:31:12.870 --> 02:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
chose to not pay the employee for the
 
02:31:14.790 --> 02:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
time that they were
 
02:31:18.469 --> 02:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
missing because of a fire or
 
02:31:18.479 --> 02:31:19.910 align:start position:0%
missing because of a fire or
whatever

02:31:19.910 --> 02:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:31:21.990 --> 02:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
would that be considered disciplinary
 
02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:23.910 align:start position:0%
would that be considered disciplinary
action

02:31:23.910 --> 02:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
action
 
02:31:25.670 --> 02:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
say for example
 
02:31:29.190 --> 02:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
it was a fire all night and the employee
 
02:31:31.110 --> 02:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
called in sick for the day
 
02:31:34.230 --> 02:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
would the employer
 
02:31:36.469 --> 02:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
be disciplining them if they chose not
 
02:31:40.469 --> 02:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
to pay them for that particular shift
 
02:31:42.550 --> 02:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
in my interpretation no when i and the
 
02:31:44.710 --> 02:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
way the bills were written um
 
02:31:44.720 --> 02:31:45.750 align:start position:0%
way the bills were written um
no

02:31:45.750 --> 02:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:31:47.510 --> 02:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
it would just be not compensating
 
02:31:49.590 --> 02:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
someone for work that they didn't do
 
02:31:51.590 --> 02:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
because they didn't show up to work and
 
02:31:52.870 --> 02:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
obviously it was extenuating
 
02:31:55.349 --> 02:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
circumstances but if they don't you know
 
02:31:57.349 --> 02:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
work and put in that labor then i don't
 
02:31:59.750 --> 02:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
see how an employer has an obligation to
 
02:32:01.349 --> 02:32:01.359 align:start position:0%
pay someone based on you know depending
 
02:32:02.870 --> 02:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
on how the contract is structured and
 
02:32:04.550 --> 02:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
everything okay
 
02:32:05.590 --> 02:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:32:05.600 --> 02:32:08.389 align:start position:0%
thank you
sullivan

02:32:08.389 --> 02:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:11.270 --> 02:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you again mr chairman um if in
 
02:32:11.280 --> 02:32:13.270 align:start position:0%
thank you again mr chairman um if in
line

02:32:13.270 --> 02:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:32:15.110 --> 02:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
15 and 16
 
02:32:18.070 --> 02:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
if the phrase leaving work to respond to
 
02:32:20.070 --> 02:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
was stricken from that
 
02:32:20.080 --> 02:32:20.870 align:start position:0%
was stricken from that
um

02:32:20.870 --> 02:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:23.270 --> 02:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
would that
 
02:32:26.550 --> 02:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
with the uh bill without that phrase
 
02:32:28.150 --> 02:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
still um
 
02:32:33.270 --> 02:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:35.190 --> 02:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh to my understanding yes i think that
 
02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
was the language that um some of us had
 
02:32:39.990 --> 02:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
discussed previously about adding to
 
02:32:41.429 --> 02:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
make it more expanded when we were kind
 
02:32:43.990 --> 02:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
of discussing myself and the co-sponsors
 
02:32:45.910 --> 02:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
of what we wanted the scope of this bill
 
02:32:47.830 --> 02:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
to be i think this edition right now
 
02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
which you know shame on me for uh for
 
02:32:53.830 --> 02:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know bringing forward a um
 
02:32:55.830 --> 02:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh for introducing something that i
 
02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
didn't entirely um understand its full
 
02:33:00.790 --> 02:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
intent but um we wanted it so then it
 
02:33:05.110 --> 02:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:07.030 --> 02:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
on a call and they were late to work
 
02:33:08.790 --> 02:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be a punishment and we
 
02:33:10.710 --> 02:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
talked about possibly having it so then
 
02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
if they were at work and they were on
 
02:33:14.790 --> 02:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
call and they were brought out of work
 
02:33:16.070 --> 02:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
we felt as if that might be too
 
02:33:18.950 --> 02:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
stringent on to employers who already
 
02:33:21.510 --> 02:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
have a a you know a shortage of labor
 
02:33:22.790 --> 02:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
right now so we thought it would be a
 
02:33:25.190 --> 02:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
good balance um to try to make it so
 
02:33:27.670 --> 02:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
than people who are late to work that
 
02:33:29.190 --> 02:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
they're not punished and that they can
 
02:33:31.110 --> 02:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
you know feasibly work their schedules
 
02:33:32.550 --> 02:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
around their current work schedule as
 
02:33:34.710 --> 02:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
many volunteer firefighters do
 
02:33:36.150 --> 02:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
i think there's merit to how it's
 
02:33:38.230 --> 02:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
currently written but i also think that
 
02:33:39.750 --> 02:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
there's more drawbacks how it's
 
02:33:41.190 --> 02:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
currently written so i would be more
 
02:33:43.510 --> 02:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
than open to an amendment to striking
 
02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:44.630 align:start position:0%
than open to an amendment to striking
out

02:33:44.630 --> 02:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:33:47.110 --> 02:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
the language on lines 15 and 16 leaving
 
02:33:52.070 --> 02:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:54.630 --> 02:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah i think i think the or i
 
02:33:56.630 --> 02:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
don't know if it would be um
 
02:33:58.230 --> 02:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
necessary maybe the war would still be
 
02:33:59.429 --> 02:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
necessary but i see what you're saying
 
02:34:00.550 --> 02:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
representative i would be opening to
 
02:34:02.950 --> 02:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
strike we'll leave it to all us
 
02:34:06.230 --> 02:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
um but um i i guess the the reason for
 
02:34:08.710 --> 02:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
suggesting that is it seems
 
02:34:10.389 --> 02:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
it seems inconsistent because at first
 
02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
it says at the commencement of a shift
 
02:34:14.790 --> 02:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
and then it says or leaving work so i
 
02:34:17.270 --> 02:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
just we either need to adjust it one way
 
02:34:19.590 --> 02:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
or the other in order to make it work
 
02:34:20.950 --> 02:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
yeah no i'd agree with that and also
 
02:34:22.469 --> 02:34:22.479 align:start position:0%
changing the uh language as
 
02:34:24.150 --> 02:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
representative avalani i'm greatly
 
02:34:26.550 --> 02:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned how we decide uh you know how
 
02:34:28.230 --> 02:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
long someone has been rendered in the
 
02:34:29.670 --> 02:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
capacity and everything i think that
 
02:34:31.990 --> 02:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
would be a good um clarification too so
 
02:34:34.070 --> 02:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
then you know someone who's worked 974
 
02:34:36.389 --> 02:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
hours is an um you know
 
02:34:38.150 --> 02:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
at a certain point there should be a
 
02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
more a better line that might be drawn
 
02:34:41.670 --> 02:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
that's better for this state for
 
02:34:44.070 --> 02:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
understanding who can benefit from this
 
02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:51.270 --> 02:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
02:34:54.710 --> 02:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
representative senators again um section
 
02:34:56.870 --> 02:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
4 27-29
 
02:34:58.710 --> 02:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
this is protective legislation that is
 
02:35:00.710 --> 02:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
under the purview of the department of
 
02:35:01.990 --> 02:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
labor and you're taking it out and
 
02:35:03.910 --> 02:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
sending it to superior court instead of
 
02:35:05.510 --> 02:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
department of labor
 
02:35:12.550 --> 02:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:14.309 --> 02:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
i can't cite any specific one that i
 
02:35:15.830 --> 02:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
have right now i can try to get back to
 
02:35:17.349 --> 02:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
you with that though but if you think
 
02:35:19.110 --> 02:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
it's better on the department of labor i
 
02:35:21.429 --> 02:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
would you know
 
02:35:23.510 --> 02:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
i would agree with your judgment you've
 
02:35:24.950 --> 02:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
served on the labor committee for a long
 
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
time so i think if you think an
 
02:35:28.150 --> 02:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
amendment should be made so then it's
 
02:35:30.230 --> 02:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
under the labor uh
 
02:35:32.150 --> 02:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
you know the division of labor i think
 
02:35:33.750 --> 02:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
that would make sense
 
02:35:40.309 --> 02:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:41.429 --> 02:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for the
 
02:35:41.439 --> 02:35:43.670 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for the
representative

02:35:43.670 --> 02:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:35:49.590 --> 02:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:51.510 --> 02:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
i have
 
02:35:55.990 --> 02:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:58.309 --> 02:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
they have not
 
02:36:04.150 --> 02:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:10.230 --> 02:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:13.590 --> 02:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
mr mckenna would you please approach
 
02:36:17.670 --> 02:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:19.270 --> 02:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
as as the judge would say please
 
02:36:23.270 --> 02:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:24.790 --> 02:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
good morning i'm peter mckenna from the
 
02:36:26.550 --> 02:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire department of labor i
 
02:36:28.070 --> 02:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
believe there are some questions for you
 
02:36:30.790 --> 02:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um 27 28 29 of the
 
02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:36.309 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um 27 28 29 of the
bill

02:36:36.309 --> 02:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:36:37.830 --> 02:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
it seems to be a sticking point for me
 
02:36:40.150 --> 02:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
taking a protective legislation under
 
02:36:42.150 --> 02:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
dol and putting it in sending it over to
 
02:36:44.070 --> 02:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
02:36:47.030 --> 02:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
would you guys find that troublesome
 
02:36:49.429 --> 02:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
so it
 
02:36:51.030 --> 02:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
certainly there are times in which there
 
02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
are dual causes of action in our statute
 
02:36:55.910 --> 02:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
there are times in which
 
02:36:57.910 --> 02:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
claimants can choose to either take
 
02:36:59.750 --> 02:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
things to a forum within the deep within
 
02:37:01.590 --> 02:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
the department thank you or they can
 
02:37:03.349 --> 02:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
either send things to the department or
 
02:37:06.070 --> 02:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
they can choose to go to superior court
 
02:37:07.510 --> 02:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware if there are any under
 
02:37:09.510 --> 02:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
this particular subheading but there are
 
02:37:11.190 --> 02:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
times in which people can make a choice
 
02:37:14.070 --> 02:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
as to where they want to go in a forum
 
02:37:15.429 --> 02:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the line in which you're
 
02:37:15.439 --> 02:37:18.790 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the line in which you're
describing

02:37:18.790 --> 02:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:19.990 --> 02:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
and could you give me the line again
 
02:37:24.870 --> 02:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:28.630 --> 02:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:30.230 --> 02:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
if you don't have numbers on yours oh i
 
02:37:32.389 --> 02:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
see i do see the numbers yes sorry uh
 
02:37:32.399 --> 02:37:36.070 align:start position:0%
see i do see the numbers yes sorry uh
chairman

02:37:36.070 --> 02:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:38.630 --> 02:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
yes and so interpreting this um there
 
02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:39.910 align:start position:0%
yes and so interpreting this um there
are

02:37:39.910 --> 02:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:37:41.590 --> 02:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
two things that could be done looking at
 
02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:43.110 align:start position:0%
two things that could be done looking at
this

02:37:43.110 --> 02:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:37:44.950 --> 02:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
reading this they could go to superior
 
02:37:48.550 --> 02:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:50.230 --> 02:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
go forward with this action but seeing
 
02:37:53.270 --> 02:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
that it's under 275 the department could
 
02:37:55.429 --> 02:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
also issue a warning letter to this
 
02:37:57.190 --> 02:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
employer if they chose to go forward
 
02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
with if they took disciplinary action
 
02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:00.950 align:start position:0%
with if they took disciplinary action
and

02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
that warning letter would instruct the
 
02:38:04.309 --> 02:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
employer that they would have 30 days to
 
02:38:06.550 --> 02:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
correct that action and if they chose
 
02:38:08.309 --> 02:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
not if they did not correct that action
 
02:38:10.710 --> 02:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
within 30 days we could seek a civil
 
02:38:13.190 --> 02:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
penalty of 2500 that's what the
 
02:38:15.030 --> 02:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
department would be able to do on its
 
02:38:17.190 --> 02:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
own or this claim it could go forward
 
02:38:19.110 --> 02:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
under superior court under this law but
 
02:38:20.710 --> 02:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
the department on its own would be able
 
02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
to go forward with the penalty provision
 
02:38:24.309 --> 02:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
which is the catch-all provision under
 
02:38:24.319 --> 02:38:26.550 align:start position:0%
which is the catch-all provision under
273-11

02:38:26.550 --> 02:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
273-11
 
02:38:28.309 --> 02:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
but under this it would provide its own
 
02:38:29.750 --> 02:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
cause of action
 
02:38:31.670 --> 02:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
which does exist in some places under
 
02:38:33.910 --> 02:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
the law but i wouldn't implicate the
 
02:38:37.110 --> 02:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
department i don't read this as the
 
02:38:39.030 --> 02:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
as the department would be the one
 
02:38:40.630 --> 02:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
litigating this it's unclear to me if
 
02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
the department would be the one
 
02:38:43.190 --> 02:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
litigating this or if this simply
 
02:38:44.790 --> 02:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
provides a cause of action for the
 
02:38:46.710 --> 02:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
claimant to go forward against their
 
02:38:46.720 --> 02:38:48.230 align:start position:0%
claimant to go forward against their
employer

02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
employer
 
02:38:49.910 --> 02:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
correct that was my follow-up mr
 
02:38:52.309 --> 02:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
chairman yes that was my question as
 
02:38:53.990 --> 02:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
well is this going to go strictly the
 
02:38:55.270 --> 02:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
superior court is the department of
 
02:38:56.870 --> 02:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
labor under protective clause is going
 
02:38:58.630 --> 02:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
to be able to adjudicate this before it
 
02:39:01.270 --> 02:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
goes to superior court and
 
02:39:03.670 --> 02:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
the one year um
 
02:39:05.429 --> 02:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
isn't there a limit a limited amount of
 
02:39:06.950 --> 02:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
time where an employee can file
 
02:39:08.790 --> 02:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
agreements with an employer with dol i
 
02:39:08.800 --> 02:39:11.110 align:start position:0%
agreements with an employer with dol i
mean

02:39:11.110 --> 02:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:39:12.550 --> 02:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
so it depends on what they would be
 
02:39:14.469 --> 02:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
filing with the department in this case
 
02:39:17.270 --> 02:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:19.910 --> 02:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
in this case the department couldn't
 
02:39:21.670 --> 02:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
restore someone to their position if
 
02:39:23.030 --> 02:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
they were terminated the department
 
02:39:24.710 --> 02:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have the ability to do that all
 
02:39:26.230 --> 02:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
we could do would be to penalize the
 
02:39:28.469 --> 02:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
employer and we could warn the employer
 
02:39:29.750 --> 02:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
so we could say
 
02:39:31.590 --> 02:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
you have 30 days to correct it or we
 
02:39:34.870 --> 02:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
could penalize you with a 2500 fine so
 
02:39:36.630 --> 02:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
through that mechanism they could
 
02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
correct it by restoring the person to
 
02:39:40.870 --> 02:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
their position within those 30 days but
 
02:39:42.630 --> 02:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
if they chose not to do that all we as
 
02:39:43.990 --> 02:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
the department would be able to do would
 
02:39:45.590 --> 02:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
be to issue the fine we actually don't
 
02:39:47.670 --> 02:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
have a mechanism where we could order
 
02:39:49.990 --> 02:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
them to restore them to the position
 
02:39:52.230 --> 02:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
so if they chose to come to us and try
 
02:39:53.910 --> 02:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
to get us to do something under this law
 
02:39:55.510 --> 02:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
all we would be able to do would be to
 
02:39:57.349 --> 02:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
get that fine give them the warning
 
02:39:59.510 --> 02:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
first and then get that fine if they
 
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
actually wanted reinstatement i think
 
02:40:03.270 --> 02:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
they would have to circumvent that
 
02:40:05.429 --> 02:40:05.439 align:start position:0%
process and and go straight to superior
 
02:40:07.670 --> 02:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
court under this provision so
 
02:40:09.349 --> 02:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
in that way it
 
02:40:11.270 --> 02:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a strange fit to be under
 
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
the labor laws in that regard but it's
 
02:40:14.950 --> 02:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
not i don't believe that it's
 
02:40:14.960 --> 02:40:15.990 align:start position:0%
not i don't believe that it's
completely

02:40:15.990 --> 02:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
completely
 
02:40:17.349 --> 02:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
i believe there are other provisions
 
02:40:18.870 --> 02:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
under the labor statute and which
 
02:40:21.190 --> 02:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
provide sort of dual causes of action
 
02:40:22.469 --> 02:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
that a person can
 
02:40:24.150 --> 02:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
pursue i think that there are provisions
 
02:40:25.830 --> 02:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
of the wage claim statute that also
 
02:40:27.750 --> 02:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
allow people to pursue a couple of
 
02:40:31.030 --> 02:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
different tracks that they can go under
 
02:40:32.950 --> 02:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
and one last follow-up mr chairman
 
02:40:34.630 --> 02:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
and that already exists without adding
 
02:40:36.309 --> 02:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
language to this you can go to superior
 
02:40:37.830 --> 02:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
court anyways if you've been agreed by a
 
02:40:39.910 --> 02:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
former employer
 
02:40:41.269 --> 02:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
so that way there wouldn't be a dual
 
02:40:43.190 --> 02:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
edge to this you're going to get a fine
 
02:40:44.550 --> 02:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
from dol and then you're also going to
 
02:40:45.510 --> 02:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
have to get
 
02:40:47.030 --> 02:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up from
 
02:40:48.710 --> 02:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
the court system judicial system
 
02:40:50.790 --> 02:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
specific to an emergency responder being
 
02:40:52.630 --> 02:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
fired from correct
 
02:40:54.309 --> 02:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
however this is worded
 
02:40:56.070 --> 02:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know specific to this in a
 
02:40:57.510 --> 02:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
situation like this i don't know what
 
02:40:59.110 --> 02:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
the cause of action the existing cause
 
02:41:01.510 --> 02:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
of action would be
 
02:41:03.110 --> 02:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of if they could go to superior
 
02:41:04.710 --> 02:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
court right now and get reinstated i
 
02:41:06.150 --> 02:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
just don't know what the law on that is
 
02:41:06.160 --> 02:41:07.190 align:start position:0%
just don't know what the law on that is
existing

02:41:07.190 --> 02:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
existing
 
02:41:09.190 --> 02:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman for your
 
02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:13.590 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman for your
announcements

02:41:13.590 --> 02:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:15.429 --> 02:41:15.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman following up on
 
02:41:17.830 --> 02:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
the same uh line of thinking
 
02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:18.950 align:start position:0%
the same uh line of thinking
um

02:41:18.950 --> 02:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:21.429 --> 02:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
as i would read this um if i was a lay
 
02:41:21.439 --> 02:41:22.550 align:start position:0%
as i would read this um if i was a lay
person

02:41:22.550 --> 02:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:41:25.030 --> 02:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
i i might assume that the only um
 
02:41:27.429 --> 02:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
recourse is in superior court um would
 
02:41:28.950 --> 02:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
it be helpful to add some language
 
02:41:31.190 --> 02:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
indicating that you know you went into
 
02:41:32.710 --> 02:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
detail about how you start with the
 
02:41:35.269 --> 02:41:35.279 align:start position:0%
department of labor
 
02:41:37.349 --> 02:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
and then perhaps to the superior court
 
02:41:40.070 --> 02:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
or you might do both because basically
 
02:41:41.670 --> 02:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
you want the department of labor to
 
02:41:43.750 --> 02:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
correct the problem with the employer
 
02:41:45.269 --> 02:41:45.279 align:start position:0%
but you want the superior court to
 
02:41:47.830 --> 02:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
reinstate you to your uh former position
 
02:41:47.840 --> 02:41:49.269 align:start position:0%
reinstate you to your uh former position
um

02:41:49.269 --> 02:41:49.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:51.830 --> 02:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
it seemed would you agree that we might
 
02:41:53.590 --> 02:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
need some additional language there to
 
02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
clarify the
 
02:41:55.200 --> 02:41:55.990 align:start position:0%
clarify the
um

02:41:55.990 --> 02:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:57.750 --> 02:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
who's in charge of what
 
02:41:59.990 --> 02:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
certainly i think if i think depending
 
02:42:01.510 --> 02:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
on what you wanted the department to be
 
02:42:02.950 --> 02:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
able to do there would need to be some
 
02:42:04.790 --> 02:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
more clarity if you wanted their the
 
02:42:06.630 --> 02:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
department to be the sort of the first
 
02:42:09.269 --> 02:42:09.279 align:start position:0%
forum to go to before you went to the
 
02:42:11.429 --> 02:42:11.439 align:start position:0%
superior court next i think there needs
 
02:42:13.510 --> 02:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
to be some additional clarity and there
 
02:42:14.710 --> 02:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
would need to be some further
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
empowerment of the department to
 
02:42:18.070 --> 02:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
actually be able to order to be
 
02:42:19.990 --> 02:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
reinstated to the position because right
 
02:42:21.590 --> 02:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
now the department doesn't have that
 
02:42:23.110 --> 02:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
power we we just don't have the
 
02:42:25.110 --> 02:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
authority to order that reinstatement
 
02:42:27.349 --> 02:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
right now if this law were to be passed
 
02:42:28.790 --> 02:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
as such and we were to learn of a
 
02:42:30.389 --> 02:42:30.399 align:start position:0%
situation like this
 
02:42:32.070 --> 02:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
all we would be able to do would be to
 
02:42:33.510 --> 02:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
send that warning letter that they have
 
02:42:35.429 --> 02:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
30 days to correct and then to issue the
 
02:42:37.830 --> 02:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
penalty and and obviously that wouldn't
 
02:42:39.349 --> 02:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
be very satisfying i think to someone
 
02:42:40.950 --> 02:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
who lost their position
 
02:42:42.389 --> 02:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
i expect and then they would want to go
 
02:42:43.830 --> 02:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
to superior court if they wanted
 
02:42:45.670 --> 02:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
something more than just us issuing the
 
02:42:48.070 --> 02:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
warning letter and the penalty so if
 
02:42:49.429 --> 02:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
there was some other
 
02:42:52.469 --> 02:42:52.479 align:start position:0%
track that was envisioned it could be to
 
02:42:54.070 --> 02:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
make the department of labor the first
 
02:42:56.309 --> 02:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
stop and to have a more full hearing on
 
02:42:57.750 --> 02:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
02:42:59.110 --> 02:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
where the claimant could actually bring
 
02:43:01.110 --> 02:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
the claim that's one option have us be
 
02:43:03.269 --> 02:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
the forum where that was heard and
 
02:43:05.429 --> 02:43:05.439 align:start position:0%
empower the department to
 
02:43:08.309 --> 02:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
actually reinstate the position and then
 
02:43:10.630 --> 02:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
have the appeal to that peering be the
 
02:43:12.870 --> 02:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
superior court or you could create two
 
02:43:14.389 --> 02:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
tracks you could say one you could have
 
02:43:16.630 --> 02:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
the hearing of the department of labor
 
02:43:18.309 --> 02:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
and empower the department although i
 
02:43:19.670 --> 02:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
think there'd be additional language
 
02:43:22.550 --> 02:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
needed to actually reinstate or they
 
02:43:24.309 --> 02:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
could go to the superior court straight
 
02:43:25.990 --> 02:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
from the beginning i think those that
 
02:43:27.750 --> 02:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
would be another way to write it
 
02:43:29.830 --> 02:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
but our present read of the bill is that
 
02:43:31.349 --> 02:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
we certainly wouldn't have the authority
 
02:43:34.309 --> 02:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
as presently written to imp reinstate
 
02:43:36.070 --> 02:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
someone to their position if they lost
 
02:43:36.080 --> 02:43:36.950 align:start position:0%
someone to their position if they lost
it

02:43:36.950 --> 02:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:43:38.550 --> 02:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
and all we currently could do would be
 
02:43:39.750 --> 02:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
that warning
 
02:43:41.590 --> 02:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
and that penalty but right now as
 
02:43:43.030 --> 02:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
reading they could circumvent us
 
02:43:44.309 --> 02:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
entirely and just go straight to
 
02:43:45.990 --> 02:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
superior court is how we would read it
 
02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.469 align:start position:0%
superior court is how we would read it
now

02:43:48.469 --> 02:43:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:49.990 --> 02:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan followed by
 
02:43:52.550 --> 02:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative cahill
 
02:43:54.150 --> 02:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
are there areas where you do have the
 
02:43:56.469 --> 02:43:56.479 align:start position:0%
power to reinstate
 
02:43:57.910 --> 02:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm not talking about this bill i'm
 
02:44:00.150 --> 02:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
talking about in other parts of uh the
 
02:44:02.550 --> 02:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
statute does the department ever have
 
02:44:05.349 --> 02:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
the ability to reinstate an employee to
 
02:44:09.030 --> 02:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:10.309 --> 02:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
going through things in my head now but
 
02:44:11.590 --> 02:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
off top of my head i don't believe that
 
02:44:13.750 --> 02:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
we do i think it is wage it is
 
02:44:15.590 --> 02:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
restoring wages but no i'm not aware of
 
02:44:17.269 --> 02:44:17.279 align:start position:0%
any ability that we have to actually
 
02:44:19.670 --> 02:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
restore someone to their job it is
 
02:44:22.070 --> 02:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
awarding wages and issuing penalties but
 
02:44:25.269 --> 02:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
no i don't believe we have that power
 
02:44:29.030 --> 02:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:31.110 --> 02:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
representative cahill
 
02:44:32.950 --> 02:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
02:44:36.070 --> 02:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
mckenna um i'm sympathetic to the bill
 
02:44:38.150 --> 02:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
but i wonder if this is sort of like an
 
02:44:38.160 --> 02:44:39.590 align:start position:0%
but i wonder if this is sort of like an
accommodation

02:44:39.590 --> 02:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
02:44:41.190 --> 02:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
where an employer
 
02:44:42.790 --> 02:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
is obligated might feel that they're
 
02:44:44.070 --> 02:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
obligated to
 
02:44:45.750 --> 02:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
come to do it if they can but if it
 
02:44:47.670 --> 02:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
comes too much of an issue
 
02:44:50.070 --> 02:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
then where do they draw the line on
 
02:44:52.150 --> 02:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
how many how many fires or events you
 
02:44:54.070 --> 02:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
know at what frequency
 
02:44:56.070 --> 02:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
is not no longer manageable for their
 
02:44:56.080 --> 02:45:05.990 align:start position:0%
is not no longer manageable for their
business

02:45:05.990 --> 02:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:08.950 --> 02:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
and so i think that is
 
02:45:09.990 --> 02:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:45:11.429 --> 02:45:11.439 align:start position:0%
a reading of what the bill i think is
 
02:45:13.030 --> 02:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
attempting to strike
 
02:45:14.389 --> 02:45:14.399 align:start position:0%
the balance that the bill is attempting
 
02:45:15.590 --> 02:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
to strike
 
02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:17.030 align:start position:0%
to strike
um

02:45:17.030 --> 02:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:19.269 --> 02:45:19.279 align:start position:0%
and i think if it came to us for
 
02:45:21.349 --> 02:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
and i think if we were
 
02:45:22.870 --> 02:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
brought into this i think that would be
 
02:45:24.389 --> 02:45:24.399 align:start position:0%
the read that we would attempt to make
 
02:45:25.990 --> 02:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
if we were
 
02:45:27.510 --> 02:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
made aware of this and were attempting
 
02:45:29.030 --> 02:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
to decide if it were appropriate to
 
02:45:31.110 --> 02:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
issue that warning letter and attempt to
 
02:45:32.870 --> 02:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
eventually pursue a fine i think that's
 
02:45:34.469 --> 02:45:34.479 align:start position:0%
how we would attempt to interpret this
 
02:45:35.670 --> 02:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
and if that was
 
02:45:38.870 --> 02:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
the violation that were committed um
 
02:45:40.150 --> 02:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
that's how we would attempt to read this
 
02:45:41.349 --> 02:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
and see if that was the violation that
 
02:45:42.630 --> 02:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
was committed
 
02:45:48.710 --> 02:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:50.950 --> 02:45:50.960 align:start position:0%

representative mandeville a point of
 
02:46:05.429 --> 02:46:05.439 align:start position:0%
order mr chairman could i request that
 
02:46:07.110 --> 02:46:07.120 align:start position:0%

come back up just for a moment
 
02:46:12.150 --> 02:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
yes of course
 
02:46:16.070 --> 02:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:17.670 --> 02:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
approach the bench
 
02:46:19.349 --> 02:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
and as a matter of full disclosure i
 
02:46:21.349 --> 02:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
should mention that i'm a um
 
02:46:23.269 --> 02:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
an officer in the harrisville volunteer
 
02:46:26.230 --> 02:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
fire company
 
02:46:27.590 --> 02:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative de chase thank you for
 
02:46:29.429 --> 02:46:29.439 align:start position:0%
coming back i we've been talking about
 
02:46:31.910 --> 02:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
the possibility of an amendment
 
02:46:34.790 --> 02:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
i wonder if i could encourage you with
 
02:46:36.710 --> 02:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
the other sponsors of this bill and any
 
02:46:38.070 --> 02:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
input you've received from the new
 
02:46:39.990 --> 02:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire chiefs association
 
02:46:43.190 --> 02:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
to think about and
 
02:46:47.030 --> 02:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
clarify one way or the other as between
 
02:46:49.269 --> 02:46:49.279 align:start position:0%
a sort of
 
02:46:51.750 --> 02:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
start of shift only or
 
02:46:54.710 --> 02:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
something more broadly than that because
 
02:46:57.110 --> 02:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
this isn't just about recruitment this
 
02:46:59.349 --> 02:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
is also about
 
02:47:02.389 --> 02:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
the kind of service that small rural
 
02:47:03.830 --> 02:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
towns get
 
02:47:03.840 --> 02:47:05.750 align:start position:0%
towns get
from

02:47:05.750 --> 02:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:47:08.150 --> 02:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
people who are employed and
 
02:47:10.309 --> 02:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
it isn't just whether they take a job or
 
02:47:12.230 --> 02:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
not or get a job or not it's whether
 
02:47:12.240 --> 02:47:13.190 align:start position:0%
not or get a job or not it's whether
they

02:47:13.190 --> 02:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:47:15.269 --> 02:47:15.279 align:start position:0%
are able to come at all
 
02:47:16.710 --> 02:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
and so if
 
02:47:18.550 --> 02:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
your group would give some thought to
 
02:47:19.990 --> 02:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
that and provide the committee with
 
02:47:22.309 --> 02:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
input on that question i for one would
 
02:47:23.429 --> 02:47:23.439 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
02:47:25.030 --> 02:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so much for the question
 
02:47:26.710 --> 02:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
with with every bill that you know i
 
02:47:27.830 --> 02:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
bring forward in front of committee i
 
02:47:29.990 --> 02:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
take notes and i write down the exact
 
02:47:32.070 --> 02:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
request that the committee has made and
 
02:47:33.830 --> 02:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
so i think everyone here has brought up
 
02:47:35.830 --> 02:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
a number of you know concerns and i was
 
02:47:36.950 --> 02:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
already planning on drafting an
 
02:47:38.150 --> 02:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
amendment and giving it to your
 
02:47:40.870 --> 02:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
researcher and having them uh you know
 
02:47:42.309 --> 02:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
submit it to the committee for you guys
 
02:47:44.790 --> 02:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
as consideration as a place to start i
 
02:47:46.150 --> 02:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
do that with every bill that i kind of
 
02:47:47.990 --> 02:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
bring forward to a committee because it
 
02:47:50.070 --> 02:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
should be more on my responsibility to
 
02:47:51.590 --> 02:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
fix the problems that i made than the
 
02:47:53.990 --> 02:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
committee to fix my problems so that's
 
02:47:55.429 --> 02:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
how i always look at it and i hope
 
02:47:57.269 --> 02:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
committees appreciate that but yeah i
 
02:47:58.710 --> 02:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
have some notes here and based on the
 
02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
feedback i'll have ols draft up
 
02:48:01.990 --> 02:48:02.000 align:start position:0%

and i'm here today with a bill which
 
03:39:07.110 --> 03:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
i believe addresses a problem that's
 
03:39:08.469 --> 03:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
been ongoing
 
03:39:10.950 --> 03:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:39:14.630 --> 03:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
yes with uh hb 1514 fn i hope to resolve
 
03:39:16.389 --> 03:39:16.399 align:start position:0%
an issue that needs leads to disputes
 
03:39:18.790 --> 03:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
over what happens with unused
 
03:39:22.389 --> 03:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
time when on with employment ends
 
03:39:25.269 --> 03:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
i have a history here of several years
 
03:39:27.269 --> 03:39:27.279 align:start position:0%
of claims filed with the state
 
03:39:28.790 --> 03:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
department of labor
 
03:39:31.590 --> 03:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh 24 percent of them in 2018
 
03:39:33.910 --> 03:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
were related to this issue
 
03:39:36.150 --> 03:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
in 2019 there was 26 percent of the
 
03:39:38.389 --> 03:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
claims 2021
 
03:39:38.399 --> 03:39:40.469 align:start position:0%
claims 2021
29

03:39:40.469 --> 03:39:40.479 align:start position:0%
29
 
03:39:42.469 --> 03:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
we shut up a bit in in 20 where there
 
03:39:44.309 --> 03:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
were 42
 
03:39:46.710 --> 03:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
of the claims involving this issue
 
03:39:48.870 --> 03:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
and it's mostly because people
 
03:39:51.510 --> 03:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
believe that what's earned what's on
 
03:39:54.469 --> 03:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
their pay stub belongs to them
 
03:39:56.389 --> 03:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
and this is something that i understand
 
03:39:58.469 --> 03:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
in the policy and the practice of the of
 
03:39:59.910 --> 03:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
the employer
 
03:40:01.590 --> 03:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
sets the tone it determines that but
 
03:40:03.510 --> 03:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
there are exceptions i think to where we
 
03:40:05.349 --> 03:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
all we all might agree
 
03:40:05.359 --> 03:40:06.870 align:start position:0%
all we all might agree
that

03:40:06.870 --> 03:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:40:08.870 --> 03:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
that the employer the employee has
 
03:40:10.870 --> 03:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
earned and should retain the time should
 
03:40:12.150 --> 03:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
be paid for it
 
03:40:16.150 --> 03:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:17.590 --> 03:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
i've cited the case where several
 
03:40:17.600 --> 03:40:18.630 align:start position:0%
i've cited the case where several
employees

03:40:18.630 --> 03:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
employees
 
03:40:20.229 --> 03:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
lost their earned time when the business
 
03:40:21.429 --> 03:40:21.439 align:start position:0%
was sold
 
03:40:23.590 --> 03:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh this was a uh
 
03:40:25.429 --> 03:40:25.439 align:start position:0%
assisted living center people weren't
 
03:40:27.750 --> 03:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
making a lot of money but the employer's
 
03:40:29.990 --> 03:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
policy said accrued vacation is not paid
 
03:40:31.910 --> 03:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
a termination and they made no no
 
03:40:33.189 --> 03:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
provision for their hours to be
 
03:40:35.110 --> 03:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
transferred to the new company where
 
03:40:36.790 --> 03:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
they continued to work in the same
 
03:40:39.030 --> 03:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
positions that they had done before
 
03:40:42.070 --> 03:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
the prior owner might have
 
03:40:43.990 --> 03:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
paid them or might have transferred the
 
03:40:46.630 --> 03:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
liability that didn't happen this was
 
03:40:48.469 --> 03:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
beyond the control of these employees
 
03:40:51.510 --> 03:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
who each lost a few hundred dollars
 
03:40:53.590 --> 03:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh in another case an employee lost
 
03:40:55.349 --> 03:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
three weeks when laid off obviously
 
03:40:56.710 --> 03:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
without notice you don't get people
 
03:40:58.229 --> 03:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
noticed i'm going to lay you off two
 
03:41:00.469 --> 03:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
months from now
 
03:41:02.550 --> 03:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
the employer's policy required that two
 
03:41:05.030 --> 03:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
weeks advance notice was was needed when
 
03:41:07.030 --> 03:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
requesting time off and that was of
 
03:41:08.469 --> 03:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
course impossible under these
 
03:41:08.479 --> 03:41:09.910 align:start position:0%
course impossible under these
circumstances

03:41:09.910 --> 03:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
03:41:12.870 --> 03:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
you earn the time it's on your pay stub
 
03:41:14.870 --> 03:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
a layoff happens nobody knows when it's
 
03:41:16.870 --> 03:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
going to happen it happens to you and
 
03:41:19.189 --> 03:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
now instead of having a job
 
03:41:22.389 --> 03:41:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh you're collecting unemployment
 
03:41:24.070 --> 03:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
so this is those are the two examples
 
03:41:26.150 --> 03:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
the other situation is where
 
03:41:28.389 --> 03:41:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh and i i had to credit or former
 
03:41:30.950 --> 03:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
member representative nunez
 
03:41:32.469 --> 03:41:32.479 align:start position:0%
who uh
 
03:41:34.469 --> 03:41:34.479 align:start position:0%
gave me this information suggestion
 
03:41:36.150 --> 03:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
leaving the employee leaves in good
 
03:41:36.160 --> 03:41:37.510 align:start position:0%
leaving the employee leaves in good
standing

03:41:37.510 --> 03:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
standing
 
03:41:40.070 --> 03:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
that is they've given notice and they
 
03:41:42.309 --> 03:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
work their notice and maybe provide some
 
03:41:45.030 --> 03:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
assistance with training their new hire
 
03:41:46.870 --> 03:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
they leave amicable you know that's to
 
03:41:48.389 --> 03:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
be encouraged
 
03:41:50.070 --> 03:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
so when that happens i think it's
 
03:41:51.990 --> 03:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable that you would pay them say
 
03:41:53.830 --> 03:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
to the person well i i guess you could
 
03:41:55.590 --> 03:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
have taken the two weeks and just left
 
03:41:57.189 --> 03:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
me in the lurch with
 
03:41:58.870 --> 03:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
very little notice but instead you did
 
03:42:01.030 --> 03:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
the right thing by by the company and
 
03:42:02.309 --> 03:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
for yourself
 
03:42:03.910 --> 03:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
and i wouldn't want you to forfeit that
 
03:42:06.229 --> 03:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
which you've earned because you've
 
03:42:08.830 --> 03:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
really done the right thing
 
03:42:08.840 --> 03:42:10.550 align:start position:0%
really done the right thing
so

03:42:10.550 --> 03:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:42:13.590 --> 03:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony
 
03:42:16.150 --> 03:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
and i also have a letter here i believe
 
03:42:17.670 --> 03:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
you've all received this this is from
 
03:42:17.680 --> 03:42:18.790 align:start position:0%
you've all received this this is from
the

03:42:18.790 --> 03:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:42:21.349 --> 03:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
wendy hunt of the
 
03:42:23.670 --> 03:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
greater nashua chamber of commerce which
 
03:42:26.150 --> 03:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
has i believe she said 400 members at
 
03:42:28.389 --> 03:42:28.399 align:start position:0%
first glance they saw the bill as it was
 
03:42:29.830 --> 03:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
it was described
 
03:42:32.150 --> 03:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
saying that the vacation vacation pay
 
03:42:33.830 --> 03:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
must be must be paid
 
03:42:36.469 --> 03:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
but upon learning of the nuances what
 
03:42:38.229 --> 03:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
was covered and what wasn't covered how
 
03:42:39.910 --> 03:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't apply to
 
03:42:42.469 --> 03:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
businesses with less than 15 people
 
03:42:45.429 --> 03:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
employees our user to lose it is not
 
03:42:46.630 --> 03:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
touched here
 
03:42:46.640 --> 03:42:47.590 align:start position:0%
touched here
the

03:42:47.590 --> 03:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:42:49.429 --> 03:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
ms hunt has written a letter saying that
 
03:42:51.349 --> 03:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
they now endorse the bill and i support
 
03:42:53.910 --> 03:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
it and that's that's the sort of thing i
 
03:42:55.990 --> 03:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
think many employers in this state would
 
03:42:56.000 --> 03:42:56.950 align:start position:0%
think many employers in this state would
do

03:42:56.950 --> 03:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:42:59.030 --> 03:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
knowing that it doesn't it doesn't
 
03:43:00.950 --> 03:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
warrant them to pay someone who's
 
03:43:02.229 --> 03:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
wronged the company in some way
 
03:43:02.239 --> 03:43:03.429 align:start position:0%
wronged the company in some way
embezzled

03:43:03.429 --> 03:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
embezzled
 
03:43:07.189 --> 03:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
or done harm to it only those who have
 
03:43:09.990 --> 03:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
either determination not not beyond
 
03:43:11.269 --> 03:43:11.279 align:start position:0%
their control
 
03:43:14.150 --> 03:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
or have as it was stated here left
 
03:43:16.229 --> 03:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
left in good standing
 
03:43:17.830 --> 03:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
i think that's a healthy situation to
 
03:43:17.840 --> 03:43:18.550 align:start position:0%
i think that's a healthy situation to
have

03:43:18.550 --> 03:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:43:21.429 --> 03:43:21.439 align:start position:0%
i'll be glad to take any questions
 
03:43:22.630 --> 03:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions to the
 
03:43:22.640 --> 03:43:23.990 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions to the
representative

03:43:23.990 --> 03:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:43:25.750 --> 03:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative mandeville
 
03:43:27.670 --> 03:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh so in the
 
03:43:30.229 --> 03:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
context of a change of uh business
 
03:43:32.790 --> 03:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
ownership and having this impact uh
 
03:43:34.469 --> 03:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
do you have any
 
03:43:34.479 --> 03:43:36.150 align:start position:0%
do you have any
um

03:43:36.150 --> 03:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:38.150 --> 03:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
ideas about how it
 
03:43:40.550 --> 03:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
has has worked or would work differently
 
03:43:42.070 --> 03:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
or better
 
03:43:43.030 --> 03:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:43:45.510 --> 03:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative uh in fact i'm aware of
 
03:43:47.269 --> 03:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
several instances where it has been
 
03:43:50.469 --> 03:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:52.630 --> 03:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
i once worked for a company that was
 
03:43:54.790 --> 03:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
acquired by another company
 
03:43:57.269 --> 03:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
which instead inquired two companies at
 
03:43:57.279 --> 03:43:58.070 align:start position:0%
which instead inquired two companies at
once

03:43:58.070 --> 03:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
once
 
03:44:00.229 --> 03:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
and in neither instance was was the
 
03:44:02.790 --> 03:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
vacation time or any benefit changed it
 
03:44:05.510 --> 03:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
carried over under the new ownership
 
03:44:05.520 --> 03:44:06.389 align:start position:0%
carried over under the new ownership
uh

03:44:06.389 --> 03:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:44:09.110 --> 03:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
i i threw this acquisition i also met my
 
03:44:10.870 --> 03:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
my future wife so there was good deal
 
03:44:13.030 --> 03:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
all the way around
 
03:44:14.870 --> 03:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
and uh hi dear
 
03:44:16.870 --> 03:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:44:18.630 --> 03:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
and when she stayed with the company and
 
03:44:21.429 --> 03:44:21.439 align:start position:0%
it was sold twice more and the last time
 
03:44:23.189 --> 03:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
that you had to reapply for her job and
 
03:44:24.870 --> 03:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
in every case
 
03:44:28.309 --> 03:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
the vacation was not gone it extended
 
03:44:30.070 --> 03:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
and that's the right way to do it i
 
03:44:30.080 --> 03:44:34.630 align:start position:0%
and that's the right way to do it i
believe

03:44:34.630 --> 03:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:37.590 --> 03:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
any additional questions represent
 
03:44:38.790 --> 03:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
03:44:40.630 --> 03:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
representative cahill um
 
03:44:42.550 --> 03:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
on line six through eight could you
 
03:44:57.269 --> 03:44:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:00.070 --> 03:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
well again i think the
 
03:45:03.110 --> 03:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
the uh the employer has the policy and
 
03:45:05.030 --> 03:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
communicates it
 
03:45:05.040 --> 03:45:06.309 align:start position:0%
communicates it
and

03:45:06.309 --> 03:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:45:08.229 --> 03:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's often explained as to
 
03:45:10.469 --> 03:45:10.479 align:start position:0%
how how much time you'll earn and how
 
03:45:13.030 --> 03:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
you can how you can ask a request for it
 
03:45:14.469 --> 03:45:14.479 align:start position:0%
and when it will be used and if there's
 
03:45:17.830 --> 03:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:19.269 --> 03:45:19.279 align:start position:0%
i think this is rather this is not
 
03:45:20.950 --> 03:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
unlike how the department already
 
03:45:22.229 --> 03:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
requires people
 
03:45:24.469 --> 03:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
employers to track payroll how many
 
03:45:26.469 --> 03:45:26.479 align:start position:0%
hours you've worked you know it's it's
 
03:45:28.630 --> 03:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
related to that it's i think this is
 
03:45:30.469 --> 03:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
something that's maybe even even buried
 
03:45:32.150 --> 03:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
down in the rules and could come up a
 
03:45:34.710 --> 03:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
bit in the statute like we often like to
 
03:45:34.720 --> 03:45:35.750 align:start position:0%
bit in the statute like we often like to
do

03:45:35.750 --> 03:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:45:35.760 --> 03:45:37.269 align:start position:0%
do
um

03:45:37.269 --> 03:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:39.189 --> 03:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
so this is i think this is how many
 
03:45:42.469 --> 03:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
companies that that provide uh vacations
 
03:45:45.030 --> 03:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
are in time off or pto i believe this is
 
03:45:47.670 --> 03:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
how they how they operate currently
 
03:45:50.710 --> 03:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
so it's not really uh
 
03:45:53.189 --> 03:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps a new requirement if you already
 
03:45:56.389 --> 03:45:56.399 align:start position:0%
have vacation time have a process
 
03:45:58.229 --> 03:45:58.239 align:start position:0%
and if you don't it seemed like it would
 
03:46:01.030 --> 03:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
be a sensible thing to do
 
03:46:04.950 --> 03:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:07.030 --> 03:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um in the absence
 
03:46:08.870 --> 03:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
of an accrual system earned time shall
 
03:46:10.790 --> 03:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
be paid on a pro-rated basis can you
 
03:46:12.630 --> 03:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
explain if the company
 
03:46:12.640 --> 03:46:13.830 align:start position:0%
explain if the company
has

03:46:13.830 --> 03:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
has
 
03:46:14.790 --> 03:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
less than
 
03:46:17.590 --> 03:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
say 15 say coupling has 15 employees as
 
03:46:19.110 --> 03:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
written and if they don't have an
 
03:46:20.469 --> 03:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
accrual system you just walk in your
 
03:46:21.750 --> 03:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
boss saying a few days off and he
 
03:46:23.429 --> 03:46:23.439 align:start position:0%
decides to pay you
 
03:46:24.550 --> 03:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
how would
 
03:46:25.510 --> 03:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
how would
 
03:46:27.349 --> 03:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
earn time shall be paid on a prorated
 
03:46:28.710 --> 03:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
basis if they don't have an accrual
 
03:46:28.720 --> 03:46:29.830 align:start position:0%
basis if they don't have an accrual
system

03:46:29.830 --> 03:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:46:31.990 --> 03:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
well i would think if they if they say
 
03:46:34.710 --> 03:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
to you that we give you two weeks a year
 
03:46:37.349 --> 03:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
then you then you uh divide that two
 
03:46:40.309 --> 03:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
weeks by the by the year it's vice versa
 
03:46:41.830 --> 03:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
and you would determine how much you
 
03:46:45.590 --> 03:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
would get if it was being accrued
 
03:46:47.670 --> 03:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
on you know depending on when when you
 
03:46:48.830 --> 03:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
when you're
 
03:46:51.189 --> 03:46:51.199 align:start position:0%
leaving thank you
 
03:46:53.750 --> 03:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative warden thank you
 
03:46:55.590 --> 03:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gail
 
03:46:58.070 --> 03:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
the question is regarding the number of
 
03:47:00.150 --> 03:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
15 or more employees is that number
 
03:47:03.429 --> 03:47:03.439 align:start position:0%
arbitrary or is that common in new
 
03:47:03.439 --> 03:47:04.389 align:start position:0%
arbitrary or is that common in new
hampshire

03:47:04.389 --> 03:47:04.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:47:06.950 --> 03:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
labor statute thank you for the question
 
03:47:09.750 --> 03:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
mr warden in fact uh that information
 
03:47:11.750 --> 03:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
was suggested to me by
 
03:47:13.990 --> 03:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
a woman who operates a business
 
03:47:15.910 --> 03:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
consulting with small businesses and she
 
03:47:18.070 --> 03:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
said don't just don't just pick a number
 
03:47:19.990 --> 03:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
use something that's fairly constant and
 
03:47:22.070 --> 03:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
well i also talked with
 
03:47:25.990 --> 03:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
deputy ogden and yes this number 15 is
 
03:47:28.630 --> 03:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
used in other places although i can't
 
03:47:34.630 --> 03:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:35.910 --> 03:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
03:47:35.920 --> 03:47:38.630 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
cahill

03:47:38.630 --> 03:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:40.630 --> 03:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you michael
 
03:47:42.389 --> 03:47:42.399 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to uh go back to your
 
03:47:44.150 --> 03:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
seat but you cannot uh
 
03:47:48.469 --> 03:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:50.710 --> 03:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
like to call rudy ogden department of
 
03:47:58.070 --> 03:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:00.309 --> 03:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you chairman um in
 
03:48:02.309 --> 03:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
terms of uh the department's position
 
03:48:04.469 --> 03:48:04.479 align:start position:0%
we've spoken on this bill or bills like
 
03:48:08.070 --> 03:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
this in the past um i would echo uh the
 
03:48:10.309 --> 03:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
words of representative cahill to state
 
03:48:13.429 --> 03:48:13.439 align:start position:0%
that we do see this issue come up quite
 
03:48:15.830 --> 03:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
frequently and but i mean by come up is
 
03:48:18.550 --> 03:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
that we get a lot of calls from folks
 
03:48:20.550 --> 03:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
usually in or around the time of their
 
03:48:22.870 --> 03:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
separation from employment where they
 
03:48:25.510 --> 03:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
ask us how this works and what i mean by
 
03:48:26.950 --> 03:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
that is when folks are considering
 
03:48:28.630 --> 03:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
leaving employment or are being told
 
03:48:30.150 --> 03:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
you're leaving employment they
 
03:48:32.070 --> 03:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
oftentimes will say you know what about
 
03:48:34.630 --> 03:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
the time that i've my vacation time or
 
03:48:38.309 --> 03:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
earn time present law 275 435
 
03:48:41.429 --> 03:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
specifically does clearly indicate
 
03:48:43.429 --> 03:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
that relative to such benefits if there
 
03:48:45.510 --> 03:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
are such benefits that they are as
 
03:48:48.309 --> 03:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
prescribed in the employer's policies or
 
03:48:50.229 --> 03:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
the employer's practice
 
03:48:52.309 --> 03:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
so presently what law says is that if an
 
03:48:54.469 --> 03:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
employer has a use it or lose it policy
 
03:48:56.309 --> 03:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
or if employer has other certain
 
03:48:59.269 --> 03:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
conditions uh relative to making that
 
03:49:01.670 --> 03:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
time become truly earned
 
03:49:03.189 --> 03:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
that they're able to impose those
 
03:49:05.030 --> 03:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
conditions so i just point out that that
 
03:49:07.269 --> 03:49:07.279 align:start position:0%
question comes up quite often as cited
 
03:49:08.870 --> 03:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
by representative cahill a number of the
 
03:49:11.429 --> 03:49:11.439 align:start position:0%
wage claims that we see come up do often
 
03:49:13.510 --> 03:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
involve this as at least an issue
 
03:49:15.830 --> 03:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's other issues but many
 
03:49:18.070 --> 03:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
times when folks leave employment and
 
03:49:19.990 --> 03:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
they file a wage claim they will cite
 
03:49:22.710 --> 03:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
this as an issue of which they want to
 
03:49:22.720 --> 03:49:23.670 align:start position:0%
this as an issue of which they want to
uh

03:49:23.670 --> 03:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:49:26.550 --> 03:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
review or have a decision come through
 
03:49:28.710 --> 03:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
an administrative law hearing in terms
 
03:49:30.469 --> 03:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
of representative avalani's question
 
03:49:32.870 --> 03:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
concerning the proration i think to the
 
03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
extent we had any additional words to
 
03:49:37.189 --> 03:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
that i would say that we would read that
 
03:49:39.349 --> 03:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
as saying that yes if you said you
 
03:49:40.950 --> 03:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
accrue a day a month they would get a
 
03:49:42.710 --> 03:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
day a month whereas if you said they uh
 
03:49:44.469 --> 03:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
get two weeks vacation and the person
 
03:49:46.710 --> 03:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
only works six months they would only be
 
03:49:48.550 --> 03:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
entitled to that week that's how we
 
03:49:49.910 --> 03:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
would see it i believe that's how
 
03:49:51.429 --> 03:49:51.439 align:start position:0%
representative cahill
 
03:49:53.990 --> 03:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
intended to describe it relative to the
 
03:49:56.309 --> 03:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
comment on 15 or more
 
03:49:57.990 --> 03:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
the other part of the law in which we
 
03:50:00.150 --> 03:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
see that i'll just give an example is
 
03:50:02.550 --> 03:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
when it talks about safety summary forms
 
03:50:04.550 --> 03:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
or joint loss management committees that
 
03:50:05.990 --> 03:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
is something that is triggered when an
 
03:50:06.000 --> 03:50:07.030 align:start position:0%
is something that is triggered when an
employer

03:50:07.030 --> 03:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
employer
 
03:50:09.269 --> 03:50:09.279 align:start position:0%
meets 15 or more so it is something that
 
03:50:12.070 --> 03:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not saying 15 is the deciding
 
03:50:13.590 --> 03:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
factor but that's certainly something
 
03:50:15.110 --> 03:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
that's leveraged elsewhere as a point in
 
03:50:16.790 --> 03:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
which an employer is considered perhaps
 
03:50:19.590 --> 03:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
shifting from very small to something
 
03:50:21.750 --> 03:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
more than that i'm happy to take any
 
03:50:23.349 --> 03:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
questions or
 
03:50:26.710 --> 03:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that come up
 
03:50:27.990 --> 03:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
is that a question or you're scratching
 
03:50:29.750 --> 03:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
your head representative sullivan
 
03:50:31.830 --> 03:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
okay adjusting your glasses
 
03:50:33.110 --> 03:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth followed by
 
03:50:33.120 --> 03:50:34.550 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth followed by
abelani

03:50:34.550 --> 03:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
abelani
 
03:50:36.550 --> 03:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:50:38.309 --> 03:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner for helping us out
 
03:50:38.319 --> 03:50:39.110 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner for helping us out
here

03:50:39.110 --> 03:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:50:39.120 --> 03:50:40.550 align:start position:0%
here
um

03:50:40.550 --> 03:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:42.950 --> 03:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
i know as you said we've
 
03:50:45.750 --> 03:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
addressed this bill similar language a
 
03:50:49.110 --> 03:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
number of times i remember
 
03:50:51.830 --> 03:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
but not the details that you had
 
03:50:53.830 --> 03:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
discussed with us
 
03:50:56.469 --> 03:50:56.479 align:start position:0%
the issue that new hampshire does not
 
03:51:00.309 --> 03:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
require that paid vacation be offered
 
03:51:00.319 --> 03:51:02.070 align:start position:0%
require that paid vacation be offered
and

03:51:02.070 --> 03:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:51:03.830 --> 03:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
i think you've shared with us some of
 
03:51:07.189 --> 03:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
the department's experience with that if
 
03:51:09.830 --> 03:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
if you remember as i remember maybe you
 
03:51:12.150 --> 03:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
can help me yeah so to be clear there is
 
03:51:13.670 --> 03:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
not a requirement in new hampshire that
 
03:51:16.309 --> 03:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
an employer provide any vacation time
 
03:51:19.429 --> 03:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
benefits such as vacation annual sick or
 
03:51:21.110 --> 03:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
things of that nature
 
03:51:22.790 --> 03:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
through a new hampshire employment law
 
03:51:24.550 --> 03:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's the employer's prerogative the
 
03:51:26.550 --> 03:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
employer can say i give you two two
 
03:51:29.510 --> 03:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
weeks a year two days a year or nothing
 
03:51:31.309 --> 03:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
so what we have when we talk about
 
03:51:33.990 --> 03:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
275.43 it's not a compulsory obligation
 
03:51:36.229 --> 03:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
that they have to provide vacation time
 
03:51:38.309 --> 03:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
it's saying if they provide vacation
 
03:51:40.309 --> 03:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
time they can actually then further
 
03:51:40.319 --> 03:51:41.189 align:start position:0%
time they can actually then further
state

03:51:41.189 --> 03:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:51:43.830 --> 03:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
such vacation time becomes due according
 
03:52:04.710 --> 03:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:05.990 --> 03:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:52:08.389 --> 03:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
i have a question rudy um
 
03:52:10.630 --> 03:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
we have some long-held beliefs in this
 
03:52:13.429 --> 03:52:13.439 align:start position:0%
committee in the state such that an
 
03:52:15.030 --> 03:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
employee's tips are owned by the
 
03:52:17.590 --> 03:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
employee and not the owner that we've
 
03:52:20.870 --> 03:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
upheld for years one of the things that
 
03:52:22.630 --> 03:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
i've expressed to representative cahill
 
03:52:24.710 --> 03:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
over the years with this bill has to do
 
03:52:26.630 --> 03:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
with not everyone has vacation time or
 
03:52:28.070 --> 03:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
earned time sometimes they just have a
 
03:52:29.670 --> 03:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
certain amount of hours do with it what
 
03:52:31.750 --> 03:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
you wish sick time house
 
03:52:33.830 --> 03:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that does bother me
 
03:52:35.750 --> 03:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
is the fact that if someone is working
 
03:52:37.269 --> 03:52:37.279 align:start position:0%
for a company it has for a number of
 
03:52:40.710 --> 03:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
years and has something provided to them
 
03:52:41.910 --> 03:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
that says this is what you're going to
 
03:52:43.510 --> 03:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
have that company gets bought out and
 
03:52:45.110 --> 03:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
those things go away
 
03:52:47.670 --> 03:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
what is the department's opinion
 
03:52:50.070 --> 03:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
when there's a change in ownership
 
03:52:52.150 --> 03:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
and the new ownership
 
03:52:54.469 --> 03:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
vacates or changes or alters or takes
 
03:52:54.479 --> 03:52:55.750 align:start position:0%
vacates or changes or alters or takes
away

03:52:55.750 --> 03:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
away
 
03:52:58.389 --> 03:52:58.399 align:start position:0%
those benefits that the original owner
 
03:53:00.870 --> 03:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
has put in place for the employees what
 
03:53:02.790 --> 03:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
is your what would your standing be on
 
03:53:04.950 --> 03:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
that so as representative cahill i think
 
03:53:06.630 --> 03:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
brought up those are oftentimes some of
 
03:53:08.630 --> 03:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
the worst scenarios because the way the
 
03:53:10.469 --> 03:53:10.479 align:start position:0%
law reads the
 
03:53:13.110 --> 03:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
employer who's ceasing operations or
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
doing the transfer they would hold the
 
03:53:17.349 --> 03:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
obligation if any and that's what i mean
 
03:53:19.269 --> 03:53:19.279 align:start position:0%
by that is if i'm an employer and i say
 
03:53:21.510 --> 03:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
to my folks you have two weeks or six
 
03:53:23.189 --> 03:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
weeks of time and you're entitled to
 
03:53:25.429 --> 03:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
that time and you don't lose it if i
 
03:53:27.429 --> 03:53:27.439 align:start position:0%
sell to a new owner
 
03:53:30.710 --> 03:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
at time of sale i should make that right
 
03:53:32.790 --> 03:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
if i don't make that right it is not the
 
03:53:35.429 --> 03:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
new owner's responsibility to take care
 
03:53:37.590 --> 03:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
of that the new owner unless as part of
 
03:53:39.990 --> 03:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
the purchase agreement they agreed to
 
03:53:41.990 --> 03:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
take on that liability and obligation
 
03:53:44.550 --> 03:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
they do not hold it we have had cases in
 
03:53:46.389 --> 03:53:46.399 align:start position:0%
which we have gone after the old
 
03:53:47.990 --> 03:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
employer and there have actually been
 
03:53:49.670 --> 03:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
cases where we've gone after the old
 
03:53:49.680 --> 03:53:50.790 align:start position:0%
cases where we've gone after the old
employer

03:53:50.790 --> 03:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
employer
 
03:53:53.189 --> 03:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
and we have had some success but i would
 
03:53:54.950 --> 03:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
point out that sometimes what happens in
 
03:53:56.550 --> 03:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
these scenarios is when someone is
 
03:53:58.229 --> 03:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
vacating a business
 
03:54:00.389 --> 03:54:00.399 align:start position:0%
and they sell that business and all of
 
03:54:02.309 --> 03:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
its assets and everything else it then
 
03:54:04.389 --> 03:54:04.399 align:start position:0%
can be very difficult to try and recoup
 
03:54:06.229 --> 03:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
time so i don't know if that's answering
 
03:54:07.830 --> 03:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
chairman infant time but i would say our
 
03:54:09.990 --> 03:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
view of it is is that there is not in
 
03:54:11.030 --> 03:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
the law
 
03:54:13.510 --> 03:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
of equity wand in which to make that
 
03:54:15.990 --> 03:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
right truly the way the law reads is the
 
03:54:18.309 --> 03:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
older exiting player should make that
 
03:54:20.150 --> 03:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
right if they do not it's not the new
 
03:54:22.389 --> 03:54:22.399 align:start position:0%
employer's obligation
 
03:54:25.030 --> 03:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
understood but the old employer
 
03:54:27.110 --> 03:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
the laws are in place that they would
 
03:54:28.550 --> 03:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
make them
 
03:54:31.590 --> 03:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
liable if their policy was that the time
 
03:54:34.630 --> 03:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
remains if if the policy was that the
 
03:54:36.469 --> 03:54:36.479 align:start position:0%
what i mean by that is if
 
03:54:37.750 --> 03:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
they essentially would have to have a
 
03:54:39.910 --> 03:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
policy that was not use it or lose it
 
03:54:41.429 --> 03:54:41.439 align:start position:0%
they would have to have a policy that
 
03:54:43.429 --> 03:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
says when you end employment you keep
 
03:54:44.630 --> 03:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
your time
 
03:54:46.710 --> 03:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
because then when the company ceases
 
03:54:48.950 --> 03:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
operation and employment ended all of
 
03:54:51.110 --> 03:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
those individuals by rights should have
 
03:54:53.750 --> 03:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
been paid out their time if that doesn't
 
03:54:56.550 --> 03:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
happen at time of transfer that's where
 
03:54:58.229 --> 03:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
it becomes a problem because now those
 
03:55:01.030 --> 03:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
folks lost that time you'd have to go
 
03:55:03.429 --> 03:55:03.439 align:start position:0%
after the old employer you cannot bring
 
03:55:05.110 --> 03:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
that claim to the new employer
 
03:55:07.269 --> 03:55:07.279 align:start position:0%
understood so if it was not a use it or
 
03:55:09.670 --> 03:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
lose it mechanism in there
 
03:55:13.110 --> 03:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:16.070 --> 03:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
whatever form an employee manual
 
03:55:18.150 --> 03:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
and the old employer
 
03:55:20.630 --> 03:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
does not provide that you do have the
 
03:55:22.870 --> 03:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in law right now
 
03:55:25.510 --> 03:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
to go after that to try to perfect there
 
03:55:27.030 --> 03:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
have been instances in which we've done
 
03:55:28.710 --> 03:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
that i would say we've done it tried to
 
03:55:30.870 --> 03:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
handle it two ways one
 
03:55:32.790 --> 03:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
at times we've tried to
 
03:55:35.990 --> 03:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
see if the new owner will do we actually
 
03:55:38.150 --> 03:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
will sometimes say can we see the how
 
03:55:40.790 --> 03:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
this was handled was there a transfer of
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
that obligation if there clearly wasn't
 
03:55:45.269 --> 03:55:45.279 align:start position:0%
then sometimes there's even been
 
03:55:47.110 --> 03:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
discussions is there any appetite for
 
03:55:48.710 --> 03:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
taking that time over and then if
 
03:55:50.389 --> 03:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
there's not then the new employer is out
 
03:55:53.110 --> 03:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
of it and then we have pursued the old
 
03:55:53.120 --> 03:55:54.229 align:start position:0%
of it and then we have pursued the old
employer

03:55:54.229 --> 03:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
employer
 
03:55:55.670 --> 03:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
and there have been instances in which
 
03:55:57.990 --> 03:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
we've been able to do wage adjustments
 
03:56:00.630 --> 03:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
and say okay old employer you sold
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
you now have this liability for those
 
03:56:04.469 --> 03:56:04.479 align:start position:0%
unpaid wages but i would point out those
 
03:56:06.469 --> 03:56:06.479 align:start position:0%
cases are hard because the old business
 
03:56:07.429 --> 03:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
is actually
 
03:56:09.269 --> 03:56:09.279 align:start position:0%
oftentimes defunct
 
03:56:12.469 --> 03:56:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh at that point understood but just
 
03:56:13.750 --> 03:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:56:15.429 --> 03:56:15.439 align:start position:0%
to be clear
 
03:56:17.590 --> 03:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
the law allows the current law in place
 
03:56:19.590 --> 03:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
allows you to do that yes you don't need
 
03:56:22.630 --> 03:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
any amendments to that law right now
 
03:56:24.469 --> 03:56:24.479 align:start position:0%
because you're doing it and it works
 
03:56:27.910 --> 03:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
in those circumstances it could work yes
 
03:56:32.870 --> 03:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:34.150 --> 03:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
i'd like to i'd like a little more
 
03:56:36.229 --> 03:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
clarification on that you said should
 
03:56:37.750 --> 03:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
and could
 
03:56:40.950 --> 03:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
is it in statute uh that shall nevermind
 
03:56:42.630 --> 03:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
should and could you know the old
 
03:56:43.990 --> 03:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
employer shall
 
03:56:46.150 --> 03:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
pay if if they owed it then it is a
 
03:56:47.990 --> 03:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
shall i'm just pointing out where
 
03:56:49.590 --> 03:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
it should is that it's not always
 
03:56:51.510 --> 03:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
possible to make it actually happen okay
 
03:56:54.229 --> 03:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:55.750 --> 03:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
no thank you for the question any
 
03:56:58.550 --> 03:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
further questions for
 
03:57:00.710 --> 03:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
the deputy
 
03:57:02.309 --> 03:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner saying none thank you very
 
03:57:02.319 --> 03:57:04.229 align:start position:0%
commissioner saying none thank you very
much

and because mr juve likes to get fun

i think is a huge improvement over
previous

03:57:54.469 --> 03:57:54.479 align:start position:0%
previous
 
03:57:56.229 --> 03:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh proposals
 
03:57:57.750 --> 03:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
03:57:59.990 --> 03:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
we have some concerns some of which are
 
03:58:02.309 --> 03:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
practical and some are which are
 
03:58:03.750 --> 03:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
philosophical i'll start with the
 
03:58:05.910 --> 03:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
philosophical ones we had discussions
 
03:58:07.590 --> 03:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
earlier today about
 
03:58:10.229 --> 03:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
business regulation and the fact that
 
03:58:12.150 --> 03:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
states and federal governments regulate
 
03:58:14.870 --> 03:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
business all the time and that's true
 
03:58:17.189 --> 03:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
and i could say well this is just
 
03:58:19.990 --> 03:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
another example of that
 
03:58:22.229 --> 03:58:22.239 align:start position:0%
but to me this is a different type of
 
03:58:24.870 --> 03:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
regulation this is the state trying to
 
03:58:28.150 --> 03:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
regulate what employee benefits should
 
03:58:29.910 --> 03:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
be and that is something that has
 
03:58:32.790 --> 03:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
traditionally been left to the employer
 
03:58:34.710 --> 03:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
and is based on a lot of things the
 
03:58:37.990 --> 03:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
employer's ability to afford the benefit
 
03:58:41.189 --> 03:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
the necessity of the benefit in order to
 
03:58:43.750 --> 03:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
attract and retain employees and i think
 
03:58:45.510 --> 03:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
we can all agree that
 
03:58:48.710 --> 03:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
all businesses are different and that
 
03:58:50.070 --> 03:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
there is
 
03:58:50.080 --> 03:58:51.030 align:start position:0%
there is
little

03:58:51.030 --> 03:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
little
 
03:58:53.750 --> 03:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh that currently exists in terms of a
 
03:58:56.070 --> 03:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
standard benefit policy that that
 
03:58:58.630 --> 03:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
businesses share so
 
03:59:01.429 --> 03:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh representative cahill and i uh just
 
03:59:05.510 --> 03:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
have a fundamental disagreement about uh
 
03:59:07.189 --> 03:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
whether it's appropriate for the state
 
03:59:09.590 --> 03:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
to be designing a one-size-fits-all
 
03:59:10.830 --> 03:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
benefit for
 
03:59:14.150 --> 03:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
employers we also have i think an honest
 
03:59:17.269 --> 03:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
disagreement over whether
 
03:59:19.990 --> 03:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
the type of time that is being discussed
 
03:59:21.830 --> 03:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
here whether it's called vacation time
 
03:59:24.469 --> 03:59:24.479 align:start position:0%
or paid time off or whatever
 
03:59:27.670 --> 03:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
is compensation he believes and the bill
 
03:59:30.469 --> 03:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
states that it is compensation
 
03:59:33.030 --> 03:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
we would argue that it is not it is a
 
03:59:35.590 --> 03:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
benefit and it's a benefit that is
 
03:59:38.550 --> 03:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
offered to attract and retain employees
 
03:59:40.150 --> 03:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
and i'll give you an example of why i
 
03:59:42.550 --> 03:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
don't consider it compensation
 
03:59:45.030 --> 03:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
the employer i work for the business in
 
03:59:47.670 --> 03:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
industry association has
 
03:59:47.680 --> 03:59:48.469 align:start position:0%
industry association has
uh

03:59:48.469 --> 03:59:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:59:51.670 --> 03:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
paid vacation benefits that employees
 
03:59:51.680 --> 03:59:52.870 align:start position:0%
paid vacation benefits that employees
accrue

03:59:52.870 --> 03:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
accrue
 
03:59:55.349 --> 03:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
um based on
 
03:59:56.710 --> 03:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
the number of years that they've worked
 
03:59:58.550 --> 03:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
for the association
 
04:00:01.030 --> 04:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
it also has as a part of that vacation
 
04:00:03.510 --> 04:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
benefit a use it or lose it policy
 
04:00:06.070 --> 04:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
meaning whatever days i've accrued if i
 
04:00:08.630 --> 04:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
have not used those at the end of the
 
04:00:11.590 --> 04:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
calendar year i lose them i don't get
 
04:00:14.630 --> 04:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
paid for them i lose them and in fact
 
04:00:16.870 --> 04:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
there have been many years where i've
 
04:00:16.880 --> 04:00:17.750 align:start position:0%
there have been many years where i've
not

04:00:17.750 --> 04:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:00:20.870 --> 04:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
used my full allotment and i received no
 
04:00:22.790 --> 04:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
compensation for that so i think it's
 
04:00:24.469 --> 04:00:24.479 align:start position:0%
difficult to
 
04:00:27.269 --> 04:00:27.279 align:start position:0%
consider it compensation because to me
 
04:00:30.229 --> 04:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
it clearly is not
 
04:00:32.070 --> 04:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
there are parts of this bill that i
 
04:00:32.080 --> 04:00:32.950 align:start position:0%
there are parts of this bill that i
don't

04:00:32.950 --> 04:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:00:34.870 --> 04:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
have a problem with
 
04:00:34.880 --> 04:00:38.950 align:start position:0%
have a problem with
lines

04:00:38.950 --> 04:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:40.870 --> 04:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
four through
 
04:00:40.880 --> 04:00:43.269 align:start position:0%
four through
ten

04:00:43.269 --> 04:00:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:45.510 --> 04:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
i guess i don't know that it needs to be
 
04:00:47.750 --> 04:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
written into state law but it certainly
 
04:00:50.469 --> 04:00:50.479 align:start position:0%
is good business practice and i think it
 
04:00:52.950 --> 04:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
would be an any employer's benefit to do
 
04:00:55.990 --> 04:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
all both a b and c
 
04:00:58.150 --> 04:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
so i don't have a strong objection to
 
04:00:58.160 --> 04:00:59.429 align:start position:0%
so i don't have a strong objection to
that

04:00:59.429 --> 04:00:59.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:01:00.790 --> 04:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
i also
 
04:01:02.469 --> 04:01:02.479 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
04:01:05.269 --> 04:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
a strong objection
 
04:01:07.830 --> 04:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
to to
 
04:01:07.840 --> 04:01:09.510 align:start position:0%
to to
certain

04:01:09.510 --> 04:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
certain
 
04:01:11.670 --> 04:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
situations that representative cahill
 
04:01:14.550 --> 04:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
and i have discussed in these situations
 
04:01:17.990 --> 04:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
involved with where an employee
 
04:01:20.950 --> 04:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
is uh laid off because there's a company
 
04:01:22.870 --> 04:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
widely off and it's it's a permanent
 
04:01:25.349 --> 04:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
layoff not a temporary one as we saw
 
04:01:27.750 --> 04:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
happen frequently during the
 
04:01:29.429 --> 04:01:29.439 align:start position:0%
pandemic a permanent layoff and the
 
04:01:31.269 --> 04:01:31.279 align:start position:0%
employee had no idea that this was
 
04:01:31.279 --> 04:01:32.469 align:start position:0%
employee had no idea that this was
coming

04:01:32.469 --> 04:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
coming
 
04:01:32.479 --> 04:01:33.429 align:start position:0%
coming
no

04:01:33.429 --> 04:01:33.439 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:01:36.790 --> 04:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
ability to use accrued vacation time
 
04:01:38.309 --> 04:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
and then the second one is the one we've
 
04:01:40.150 --> 04:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
had some conversation on about whether
 
04:01:42.150 --> 04:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
there's a sale from
 
04:01:44.950 --> 04:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
one company to another i would again
 
04:01:46.389 --> 04:01:46.399 align:start position:0%
that may be a situation that the
 
04:01:48.229 --> 04:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
employee has no
 
04:01:50.150 --> 04:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge or ability to act on i would
 
04:01:52.469 --> 04:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
caution the committee that
 
04:01:55.349 --> 04:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
creating that benefit you're now getting
 
04:01:58.150 --> 04:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
into merger and acquisition law which
 
04:02:00.630 --> 04:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
you may or may not want to get into
 
04:02:00.640 --> 04:02:01.510 align:start position:0%
you may or may not want to get into
but

04:02:01.510 --> 04:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:02:03.670 --> 04:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
i can certainly understand from the
 
04:02:05.510 --> 04:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
employee point of view
 
04:02:08.870 --> 04:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
that they did not have the ability to to
 
04:02:10.710 --> 04:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
act on on
 
04:02:12.790 --> 04:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
their benefit
 
04:02:12.800 --> 04:02:13.510 align:start position:0%
their benefit
i

04:02:13.510 --> 04:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:02:13.520 --> 04:02:14.550 align:start position:0%
i
remain

04:02:14.550 --> 04:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
remain
 
04:02:16.309 --> 04:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
04:02:18.309 --> 04:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
the section of this proposal that says
 
04:02:21.189 --> 04:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
if an employee leaves in good standing
 
04:02:21.199 --> 04:02:22.630 align:start position:0%
if an employee leaves in good standing
because

04:02:22.630 --> 04:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:02:24.309 --> 04:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
again i think it should be up to the
 
04:02:26.710 --> 04:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
employer to decide whether that benefit
 
04:02:28.790 --> 04:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
should be paid out if unused it
 
04:02:30.070 --> 04:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
04:02:32.790 --> 04:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
a state mandate that employers choose to
 
04:02:35.510 --> 04:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
do that employers must do so
 
04:02:36.710 --> 04:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i hope i didn't
 
04:02:38.389 --> 04:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
ramble on too long i'm happy to answer
 
04:02:38.399 --> 04:02:40.630 align:start position:0%
ramble on too long i'm happy to answer
questions

04:02:40.630 --> 04:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:02:44.229 --> 04:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:46.150 --> 04:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr duvet
 
04:02:49.110 --> 04:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
um so you're okay with the 15 employee
 
04:02:49.120 --> 04:02:50.550 align:start position:0%
um so you're okay with the 15 employee
employees

04:02:50.550 --> 04:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:02:52.389 --> 04:02:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question yeah that
 
04:02:55.429 --> 04:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
that is a commonly used number here in
 
04:02:57.349 --> 04:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
the state it's used in a lot of
 
04:02:59.349 --> 04:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
different areas including discrimination
 
04:03:01.030 --> 04:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
laws and it
 
04:03:03.670 --> 04:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
worry to move forward with this proposal
 
04:03:05.590 --> 04:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
which i don't support but were you to
 
04:03:07.670 --> 04:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
move forward with it that number of 15
 
04:03:09.269 --> 04:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
is something that many employers would
 
04:03:09.279 --> 04:03:18.389 align:start position:0%
is something that many employers would
recognize

04:03:18.389 --> 04:03:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:21.349 --> 04:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um mr gervais
 
04:03:21.359 --> 04:03:22.070 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um mr gervais
you

04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:03:24.469 --> 04:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
for context you referenced philosophical
 
04:03:27.110 --> 04:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
objections to the legislation and you
 
04:03:29.189 --> 04:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
said something along the lines of
 
04:03:29.199 --> 04:03:30.150 align:start position:0%
said something along the lines of
um

04:03:30.150 --> 04:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:31.910 --> 04:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
it would be the state determining what
 
04:03:33.510 --> 04:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
benefits are could you just repeat that
 
04:03:35.910 --> 04:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
line for my clarification
 
04:03:38.229 --> 04:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
04:03:40.630 --> 04:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
the association i represent which is an
 
04:03:43.030 --> 04:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
employer advocacy group believes it's
 
04:03:45.189 --> 04:03:45.199 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for the state
 
04:03:46.950 --> 04:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
to try to
 
04:03:46.960 --> 04:03:48.229 align:start position:0%
to try to
design

04:03:48.229 --> 04:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
design
 
04:03:50.790 --> 04:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
benef work benefit programs and that
 
04:03:53.349 --> 04:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
should be left to the employer
 
04:03:53.359 --> 04:03:54.950 align:start position:0%
should be left to the employer
follow-up

04:03:54.950 --> 04:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:03:56.229 --> 04:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:03:57.790 --> 04:03:57.800 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at
 
04:03:57.800 --> 04:03:59.349 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at
v-a

04:03:59.349 --> 04:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
v-a
 
04:04:00.790 --> 04:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
an employee who leaves in good standing
 
04:04:02.229 --> 04:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
whose termination as a result of a
 
04:04:05.110 --> 04:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
layoff shall be paid for unused earned
 
04:04:07.670 --> 04:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
time no later than the next regular pay
 
04:04:07.680 --> 04:04:08.550 align:start position:0%
time no later than the next regular pay
period

04:04:08.550 --> 04:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
period
 
04:04:10.550 --> 04:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
at no point in that sentence do i see
 
04:04:13.030 --> 04:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
the creation of a new benefit but merely
 
04:04:15.830 --> 04:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
the state just requiring that benefits
 
04:04:17.590 --> 04:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
that were previously earned to be paid
 
04:04:19.429 --> 04:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
where is your disagreement there
 
04:04:22.070 --> 04:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
my disagreement is that unless the
 
04:04:24.790 --> 04:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
employer is a stipulated is a part of
 
04:04:26.870 --> 04:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
the benefit that
 
04:04:30.469 --> 04:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh earned but unused uh time will be
 
04:04:32.309 --> 04:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
paid out at the time of
 
04:04:34.870 --> 04:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
termination you're creating a new
 
04:04:34.880 --> 04:04:36.229 align:start position:0%
termination you're creating a new
benefit

04:04:36.229 --> 04:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
04:04:38.070 --> 04:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up
 
04:04:38.080 --> 04:04:39.110 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up
so

04:04:39.110 --> 04:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:04:41.429 --> 04:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
would you then disagree
 
04:04:41.439 --> 04:04:42.469 align:start position:0%
would you then disagree
that

04:04:42.469 --> 04:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:04:46.070 --> 04:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
um this is not requiring employees to
 
04:04:46.080 --> 04:04:47.349 align:start position:0%
um this is not requiring employees to
create

04:04:47.349 --> 04:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
create
 
04:04:50.790 --> 04:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
a unused earned time or to require them
 
04:04:53.189 --> 04:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
to provide earn time but that it is your
 
04:04:55.670 --> 04:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
opinion in the position of the bia
 
04:04:55.680 --> 04:04:56.550 align:start position:0%
opinion in the position of the bia
that

04:04:56.550 --> 04:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:04:59.429 --> 04:04:59.439 align:start position:0%
uh unused earned time being required to
 
04:05:01.349 --> 04:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
be paid to employees who had previously
 
04:05:02.389 --> 04:05:02.399 align:start position:0%
earned it
 
04:05:05.269 --> 04:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
is the establishment of a new benefit
 
04:05:08.309 --> 04:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
i believe the latter if i followed your
 
04:05:13.030 --> 04:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:13.040 --> 04:05:16.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:05:16.710 --> 04:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:18.710 --> 04:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um just for
 
04:05:21.910 --> 04:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
clarification mr duvet um lines 21 22
 
04:05:23.269 --> 04:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
and 23
 
04:05:25.269 --> 04:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
um define
 
04:05:27.429 --> 04:05:27.439 align:start position:0%
vacation time pay time off and earn time
 
04:05:29.110 --> 04:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
and shall be considered compensation is
 
04:05:31.269 --> 04:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
that where the issue is
 
04:05:33.510 --> 04:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
well i have a couple of issues one uh
 
04:05:35.590 --> 04:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
considering a compensation i've already
 
04:05:37.590 --> 04:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
addressed we believe it's a benefit and
 
04:05:40.309 --> 04:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
it is not compensation i do have another
 
04:05:43.110 --> 04:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
concern that i didn't mention which is
 
04:05:44.870 --> 04:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
companies call
 
04:05:47.349 --> 04:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
paid time off a lot of different things
 
04:05:49.349 --> 04:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
for example my employer
 
04:05:53.110 --> 04:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
has both vacation time and what we call
 
04:05:55.269 --> 04:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
personal time and personal time is meant
 
04:05:56.950 --> 04:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
to be used for
 
04:05:59.670 --> 04:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
sick days which this bill
 
04:06:00.870 --> 04:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
alludes to
 
04:06:03.269 --> 04:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
but it all can also be used if
 
04:06:05.269 --> 04:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
you're a parent and your child is sick
 
04:06:07.110 --> 04:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
and has to stay home from school and you
 
04:06:08.469 --> 04:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
need to stay home
 
04:06:13.429 --> 04:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:16.150 --> 04:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
it can be used for other reasons if if
 
04:06:16.160 --> 04:06:16.950 align:start position:0%
it can be used for other reasons if if
you're

04:06:16.950 --> 04:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:06:19.269 --> 04:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
having to move on a certain day and it's
 
04:06:20.950 --> 04:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
not a weekend and
 
04:06:22.710 --> 04:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
you can't be at work and move at the
 
04:06:27.110 --> 04:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
same time it's it's intended for um
 
04:06:27.120 --> 04:06:28.710 align:start position:0%
same time it's it's intended for um
situations

04:06:28.710 --> 04:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
situations
 
04:06:30.790 --> 04:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
involving employees where they need time
 
04:06:32.550 --> 04:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
away from work that
 
04:06:34.229 --> 04:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
none of us would normally consider a
 
04:06:34.239 --> 04:06:35.830 align:start position:0%
none of us would normally consider a
vacation

04:06:35.830 --> 04:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
vacation
 
04:06:38.550 --> 04:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh and this doesn't address how that
 
04:06:43.189 --> 04:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:45.189 --> 04:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um and the
 
04:06:45.199 --> 04:06:46.950 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um and the
following

04:06:46.950 --> 04:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
following
 
04:06:49.510 --> 04:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
line 23 defined sick time or sick day
 
04:06:51.510 --> 04:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
shall not be considered wages
 
04:06:53.429 --> 04:06:53.439 align:start position:0%
so the state
 
04:06:55.429 --> 04:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
the purpose of va would be
 
04:06:57.189 --> 04:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
defining certain times office
 
04:06:59.990 --> 04:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
compensation certain time certain words
 
04:07:00.000 --> 04:07:00.710 align:start position:0%
compensation certain time certain words
as

04:07:00.710 --> 04:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:07:02.710 --> 04:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
not compensation could you
 
04:07:06.229 --> 04:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
i agree that that's what it does but i i
 
04:07:08.870 --> 04:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
guess i would further say again
 
04:07:08.880 --> 04:07:10.070 align:start position:0%
guess i would further say again
um

04:07:10.070 --> 04:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
in my case my individual case where i
 
04:07:14.389 --> 04:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
get personal time
 
04:07:18.150 --> 04:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
paid time off personal time as a benefit
 
04:07:20.950 --> 04:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
i can use that if i need to for sick
 
04:07:22.389 --> 04:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
time or
 
04:07:25.229 --> 04:07:25.239 align:start position:0%
i am eligible to use it for other
 
04:07:28.150 --> 04:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
non-vacation related situations that may
 
04:07:29.269 --> 04:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
come up
 
04:07:30.710 --> 04:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
and this
 
04:07:32.710 --> 04:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
proposal doesn't really make it clear
 
04:07:35.510 --> 04:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
how that will be treated in terms of
 
04:07:37.590 --> 04:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
should the employee be paid for that
 
04:07:41.750 --> 04:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:43.590 --> 04:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
welcome representative schmidt followed
 
04:07:45.590 --> 04:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
by uh representative
 
04:07:47.590 --> 04:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
04:07:49.990 --> 04:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
gervais nice to see you again
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
you used the word benefit as if it were
 
04:07:55.590 --> 04:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
a gift from the employer
 
04:07:57.510 --> 04:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
in my estimation it's part of an
 
04:08:01.030 --> 04:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
employee package that is a contract that
 
04:08:03.670 --> 04:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
the employee has with the employer
 
04:08:06.229 --> 04:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
certain things are are yes certain
 
04:08:07.830 --> 04:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
things are given certain things are
 
04:08:11.189 --> 04:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
expected also along with that are the
 
04:08:13.110 --> 04:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
benefits that are listed
 
04:08:14.710 --> 04:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
arbitrary they're listed in the employee
 
04:08:19.750 --> 04:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
contract well they should be
 
04:08:21.349 --> 04:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
and if they're there then it should be
 
04:08:24.070 --> 04:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
part of this as well that when you leave
 
04:08:26.309 --> 04:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
you aren't asking for a gift from your
 
04:08:28.149 --> 04:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
employer you're asking for them to
 
04:08:30.790 --> 04:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
fulfill the contract that you had agreed
 
04:08:32.389 --> 04:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
with them at the very beginning is that
 
04:08:32.399 --> 04:08:33.750 align:start position:0%
with them at the very beginning is that
true

04:08:33.750 --> 04:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:08:36.950 --> 04:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
i i agree with the general thrust of
 
04:08:39.670 --> 04:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
your question i disagree
 
04:08:42.389 --> 04:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
with suggesting that if an employer
 
04:08:42.399 --> 04:08:43.510 align:start position:0%
with suggesting that if an employer
offers

04:08:43.510 --> 04:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
offers
 
04:08:45.030 --> 04:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
a paid
 
04:08:47.510 --> 04:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
vacation benefit or a paid time benefit
 
04:08:50.309 --> 04:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't specifically say
 
04:08:52.870 --> 04:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
that the employee will be paid for
 
04:08:54.070 --> 04:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
you un
 
04:08:57.349 --> 04:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
earned but unused time when they leave
 
04:08:59.349 --> 04:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
that they are somehow
 
04:09:02.149 --> 04:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
somehow eligible for that absent a
 
04:09:03.990 --> 04:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
change in state law
 
04:09:06.950 --> 04:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
we you mentioned a contract i think in
 
04:09:08.309 --> 04:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
some ways where
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's semantics whether we call it a
 
04:09:12.710 --> 04:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
benefit or a gift or a contract
 
04:09:14.309 --> 04:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
but to the extent that you want to
 
04:09:16.950 --> 04:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
consider it a contract it should
 
04:09:16.960 --> 04:09:18.229 align:start position:0%
consider it a contract it should
stipulate

04:09:18.229 --> 04:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
stipulate
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
exactly what the employee is do is is a
 
04:09:23.429 --> 04:09:23.439 align:start position:0%
part of their employment
 
04:09:25.510 --> 04:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
and if it doesn't say that
 
04:09:29.269 --> 04:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that they get it
 
04:09:31.110 --> 04:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
presented to me
 
04:09:32.229 --> 04:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
followed by
 
04:09:33.750 --> 04:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
mandeville and notion
 
04:09:35.910 --> 04:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chairman
 
04:09:38.469 --> 04:09:38.479 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
 
04:09:42.229 --> 04:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
pretty much along uh the same line as as
 
04:09:45.590 --> 04:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:49.269 --> 04:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
i've worked at a lot of places and and
 
04:09:49.279 --> 04:09:50.469 align:start position:0%
i've worked at a lot of places and and
one

04:09:50.469 --> 04:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:09:53.349 --> 04:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
i'll give the last place i work i was
 
04:09:55.030 --> 04:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
given a
 
04:09:58.950 --> 04:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:02.389 --> 04:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations and and policies
 
04:10:04.950 --> 04:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
and i read through that and signed it
 
04:10:04.960 --> 04:10:05.910 align:start position:0%
and i read through that and signed it
now

04:10:05.910 --> 04:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:10:07.510 --> 04:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
that kind of a
 
04:10:10.630 --> 04:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
of a policy uh statement can say a lot
 
04:10:11.990 --> 04:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
of things
 
04:10:13.269 --> 04:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
one of the things
 
04:10:14.550 --> 04:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things
 
04:10:17.590 --> 04:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
could be like you had use it or lose it
 
04:10:20.149 --> 04:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
and i had user to lose it and i lost
 
04:10:22.149 --> 04:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
some time as probably for the same
 
04:10:24.550 --> 04:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
reasons i had no problem with that
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
because that was the agreement
 
04:10:29.750 --> 04:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
i've also seen
 
04:10:32.149 --> 04:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
policy manuals that say
 
04:10:36.309 --> 04:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
you have let's say 10 days vacation
 
04:10:36.319 --> 04:10:37.110 align:start position:0%
you have let's say 10 days vacation
but

04:10:37.110 --> 04:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:10:39.590 --> 04:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh you have to have worked
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
a full year
 
04:10:43.910 --> 04:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
to be eligible for it and it says it
 
04:10:46.469 --> 04:10:46.479 align:start position:0%
and if you leave in nine months for
 
04:10:48.149 --> 04:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
whatever reason
 
04:10:49.990 --> 04:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
then you don't get it
 
04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
no problem there but if if it says
 
04:10:54.319 --> 04:10:55.110 align:start position:0%
no problem there but if if it says
in

04:10:55.110 --> 04:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:10:57.429 --> 04:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
the policy manual
 
04:11:00.790 --> 04:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
you accumulate one day per month of
 
04:11:03.110 --> 04:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
vacation let's say
 
04:11:09.189 --> 04:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:10.870 --> 04:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
an employer's
 
04:11:14.389 --> 04:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
obligation to pay a supplier or
 
04:11:17.590 --> 04:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
or a plumber
 
04:11:21.189 --> 04:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
i mean it's it literally is an agreement
 
04:11:23.349 --> 04:11:23.359 align:start position:0%
that the employer makes
 
04:11:25.590 --> 04:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
do you agree or disagree with my reading
 
04:11:30.070 --> 04:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
of that um i respectfully disagree
 
04:11:35.349 --> 04:11:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:37.830 --> 04:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh thank you mr
 
04:11:40.790 --> 04:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
today um maybe um i'm
 
04:11:42.870 --> 04:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
just trying to slice she's a little
 
04:11:44.790 --> 04:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
thinner here but and i apologize for
 
04:11:45.750 --> 04:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
that but
 
04:11:45.760 --> 04:11:46.790 align:start position:0%
that but
um

04:11:46.790 --> 04:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:48.309 --> 04:11:48.319 align:start position:0%
following up on the last two questions
 
04:11:48.319 --> 04:11:49.189 align:start position:0%
following up on the last two questions
then

04:11:49.189 --> 04:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:11:51.110 --> 04:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
is it fair to say that you
 
04:11:53.269 --> 04:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
would uh and none of us are talking
 
04:11:54.630 --> 04:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
about a gift here we're talking about
 
04:11:56.550 --> 04:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
the concept of a benefit and its
 
04:11:58.389 --> 04:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
relationship to compensation
 
04:12:00.309 --> 04:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
would you say that
 
04:12:03.910 --> 04:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
absent a specification by
 
04:12:03.920 --> 04:12:06.469 align:start position:0%
absent a specification by
a

04:12:06.469 --> 04:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:08.149 --> 04:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
an employer that
 
04:12:08.159 --> 04:12:10.070 align:start position:0%
an employer that
the

04:12:10.070 --> 04:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:12:12.630 --> 04:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
that the employee retains
 
04:12:14.229 --> 04:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
some interest
 
04:12:14.239 --> 04:12:15.269 align:start position:0%
some interest
in

04:12:15.269 --> 04:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:12:18.389 --> 04:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
the value of time off or time off itself
 
04:12:18.399 --> 04:12:19.670 align:start position:0%
the value of time off or time off itself
um

04:12:19.670 --> 04:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:21.189 --> 04:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
the employees
 
04:12:21.199 --> 04:12:21.990 align:start position:0%
the employees
should

04:12:21.990 --> 04:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
should
 
04:12:22.000 --> 04:12:23.030 align:start position:0%
should
always

04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
always
 
04:12:25.429 --> 04:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
understand that the nature of the
 
04:12:28.710 --> 04:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
contract that's been described
 
04:12:31.750 --> 04:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
does not include any right
 
04:12:33.990 --> 04:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
to that benefit
 
04:12:35.670 --> 04:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
in the event
 
04:12:38.790 --> 04:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
that the employee for reasons beyond his
 
04:12:41.590 --> 04:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:41.600 --> 04:12:42.830 align:start position:0%
 
becomes

04:12:42.830 --> 04:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
04:12:44.790 --> 04:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
unemployed let me answer that in a
 
04:12:46.229 --> 04:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
couple of different ways
 
04:12:48.309 --> 04:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
i did testify that i have a lot of
 
04:12:50.950 --> 04:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
sympathy for employees who through no
 
04:12:53.269 --> 04:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
fault of their owner no action of their
 
04:12:53.279 --> 04:12:54.630 align:start position:0%
fault of their owner no action of their
own

04:12:54.630 --> 04:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
own
 
04:12:55.990 --> 04:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
either through a
 
04:12:58.790 --> 04:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
involuntary layoff that they had no way
 
04:13:01.269 --> 04:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
of knowing would take place or the sale
 
04:13:03.110 --> 04:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
of the company that they didn't know
 
04:13:04.550 --> 04:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
either didn't know it would take place
 
04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
or didn't understand the impact of it i
 
04:13:09.030 --> 04:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
have a lot of sympathy
 
04:13:10.870 --> 04:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
for those employees
 
04:13:14.790 --> 04:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
this bill goes beyond that to get to
 
04:13:16.469 --> 04:13:16.479 align:start position:0%
to i think
 
04:13:17.510 --> 04:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
what the
 
04:13:20.710 --> 04:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
thrust of your question was
 
04:13:23.510 --> 04:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
i think that employees
 
04:13:25.429 --> 04:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
do have
 
04:13:28.550 --> 04:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
a cause for action or the ability to
 
04:13:30.710 --> 04:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
make a complaint with the department if
 
04:13:33.189 --> 04:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
the employer does not live up to what's
 
04:13:35.750 --> 04:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
written in their benefits policy or
 
04:13:38.149 --> 04:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
their employee handbook
 
04:13:38.159 --> 04:13:39.510 align:start position:0%
their employee handbook
but

04:13:39.510 --> 04:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:13:39.520 --> 04:13:41.030 align:start position:0%
but
unless

04:13:41.030 --> 04:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
unless
 
04:13:43.030 --> 04:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
that benefit or employee handbook
 
04:13:45.830 --> 04:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
specifically states that an employee
 
04:13:48.469 --> 04:13:48.479 align:start position:0%
will be eligible to be paid
 
04:13:48.479 --> 04:13:49.429 align:start position:0%
will be eligible to be paid
for

04:13:49.429 --> 04:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:13:53.110 --> 04:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
earned but unused vacation time
 
04:13:56.630 --> 04:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
when their employment is terminated
 
04:13:58.790 --> 04:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's not an employee benefit it has to
 
04:14:02.469 --> 04:14:02.479 align:start position:0%
be stated that it's a benefit you can't
 
04:14:02.479 --> 04:14:03.269 align:start position:0%
be stated that it's a benefit you can't
just

04:14:03.269 --> 04:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:14:05.189 --> 04:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
i don't believe
 
04:14:07.189 --> 04:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
you can just assume that that is the
 
04:14:09.670 --> 04:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
case that's not what the benefit
 
04:14:11.750 --> 04:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
says and
 
04:14:13.590 --> 04:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
i suppose
 
04:14:15.750 --> 04:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
if if this
 
04:14:18.229 --> 04:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
were something that employees were aware
 
04:14:21.110 --> 04:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
of or curious about or concerned with
 
04:14:23.030 --> 04:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
it should come up at the time where
 
04:14:25.670 --> 04:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
they're discussing the benefit package
 
04:14:29.750 --> 04:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:29.760 --> 04:14:32.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:14:32.630 --> 04:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:35.110 --> 04:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um mr gervais i'm
 
04:14:38.469 --> 04:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
looking at uh v-a again
 
04:14:40.469 --> 04:14:40.479 align:start position:0%
um for the purposes of this paragraph
 
04:14:43.189 --> 04:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
the terms earn time vacation or vacation
 
04:14:45.429 --> 04:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
time and paid time off shall be
 
04:14:47.269 --> 04:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
considered compensation and therefore
 
04:14:49.110 --> 04:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
constitute wages due
 
04:14:51.670 --> 04:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
would it satisfy the concerns of the bia
 
04:14:54.550 --> 04:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
to move that language up into
 
04:14:54.560 --> 04:14:55.910 align:start position:0%
to move that language up into
definitions

04:14:55.910 --> 04:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
04:14:58.950 --> 04:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh closer to new section and provide a
 
04:14:58.960 --> 04:14:59.750 align:start position:0%
uh closer to new section and provide a
more

04:14:59.750 --> 04:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:15:02.870 --> 04:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh general description of
 
04:15:05.189 --> 04:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
time that an employee is otherwise
 
04:15:08.229 --> 04:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
capable of substituting for paid time
 
04:15:09.830 --> 04:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:15:11.990 --> 04:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
respectfully i'd
 
04:15:13.830 --> 04:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
maybe i think i'd have to look at the
 
04:15:17.429 --> 04:15:17.439 align:start position:0%
language and and go back to some of our
 
04:15:20.309 --> 04:15:20.319 align:start position:0%
members that we get guidance from and
 
04:15:22.550 --> 04:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
ask them so it's hard for me to say yes
 
04:15:23.830 --> 04:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
or no without
 
04:15:25.510 --> 04:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
seeing the actual language you're
 
04:15:25.520 --> 04:15:26.630 align:start position:0%
seeing the actual language you're
suggesting

04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
suggesting
 
04:15:28.870 --> 04:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
it's still
 
04:15:31.030 --> 04:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
you know i'm still uncomfortable with
 
04:15:34.469 --> 04:15:34.479 align:start position:0%
proposals like this that try and spell
 
04:15:34.479 --> 04:15:35.910 align:start position:0%
proposals like this that try and spell
out

04:15:35.910 --> 04:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:15:38.870 --> 04:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
what employer benefits should be and i
 
04:15:40.710 --> 04:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
think some of the questions around the
 
04:15:43.510 --> 04:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
table are illustrating the difficulty in
 
04:15:45.590 --> 04:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
doing that because there are a lot of
 
04:15:48.550 --> 04:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
variables that go into a benefit package
 
04:15:50.389 --> 04:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of differences in terms
 
04:15:53.110 --> 04:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
that go into benefit packages and it's
 
04:15:54.630 --> 04:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
and it's hard
 
04:15:56.389 --> 04:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
i believe to
 
04:16:00.630 --> 04:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:02.790 --> 04:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
employee benefit
 
04:16:02.800 --> 04:16:04.070 align:start position:0%
employee benefit
that

04:16:04.070 --> 04:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:16:09.269 --> 04:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:11.590 --> 04:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr german um well i'm looking
 
04:16:11.600 --> 04:16:12.830 align:start position:0%
thank you mr german um well i'm looking
at

04:16:12.830 --> 04:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:16:14.550 --> 04:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh want i
 
04:16:14.560 --> 04:16:15.349 align:start position:0%
uh want i
a

04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:16:17.990 --> 04:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh inform employees in writing of any
 
04:16:20.950 --> 04:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
policy regarding accrual or medicine i'm
 
04:16:28.630 --> 04:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at it on the state house
 
04:16:33.349 --> 04:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
website thank you i just lost you
 
04:16:34.950 --> 04:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead i'm sorry thank you mr chairman
 
04:16:36.790 --> 04:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
um so i am just going to read the
 
04:16:39.990 --> 04:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
sentence for context um an employer that
 
04:16:43.189 --> 04:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
no wrong one inform employees of writing
 
04:16:45.510 --> 04:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
in writing of any policy regarding
 
04:16:47.349 --> 04:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
accrual or use
 
04:16:50.710 --> 04:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
of unused earned time and any limits on
 
04:16:52.950 --> 04:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
accrual or use
 
04:16:55.990 --> 04:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
why does that line not provide the kind
 
04:16:57.910 --> 04:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
of flexibility for an employer to be
 
04:17:00.469 --> 04:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
upfront with employees
 
04:17:02.309 --> 04:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
ahead of time as to what benefits they
 
04:17:05.429 --> 04:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
would be able to expect upon separation
 
04:17:08.469 --> 04:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
outside of the mandate
 
04:17:10.309 --> 04:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry but were you referring to the
 
04:17:12.790 --> 04:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
language in the in the bill here
 
04:17:15.750 --> 04:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
line six of the bill yep i i already uh
 
04:17:18.309 --> 04:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
testified i don't have a lot of problem
 
04:17:19.990 --> 04:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
with that language i think that's just
 
04:17:22.630 --> 04:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
standard good business practice and if
 
04:17:24.550 --> 04:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
businesses aren't doing that they'll
 
04:17:26.469 --> 04:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
probably at some point or another have
 
04:17:29.349 --> 04:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
have an impact associated with that
 
04:17:29.359 --> 04:17:31.990 align:start position:0%
have an impact associated with that
now

04:17:31.990 --> 04:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:34.710 --> 04:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
you say no follow-up okay
 
04:17:36.950 --> 04:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative abalone
 
04:17:38.710 --> 04:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you again mr
 
04:17:42.630 --> 04:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
duvet um lines 12 13 and 14
 
04:17:45.910 --> 04:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
which will be section two under this
 
04:17:45.920 --> 04:17:47.429 align:start position:0%
which will be section two under this
proposal

04:17:47.429 --> 04:17:47.439 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
04:17:47.439 --> 04:17:50.389 align:start position:0%
proposal
um

04:17:50.389 --> 04:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:52.070 --> 04:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
one of your companies has a user to lose
 
04:17:53.830 --> 04:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
it under vacation time or in time but
 
04:17:55.750 --> 04:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
they let you bank sick time
 
04:17:57.990 --> 04:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
to 80 hours
 
04:17:59.670 --> 04:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
over the life of your employment or up
 
04:18:02.149 --> 04:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
to 80 hours bank period
 
04:18:03.510 --> 04:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
under this
 
04:18:05.590 --> 04:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
if those if that sick time is sitting
 
04:18:06.950 --> 04:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
there when they're
 
04:18:06.960 --> 04:18:10.149 align:start position:0%
there when they're
separated

04:18:10.149 --> 04:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:12.149 --> 04:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
shall not be considered as wages do they
 
04:18:13.670 --> 04:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
would lose that time
 
04:18:15.189 --> 04:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
even though they banked it under the
 
04:18:15.199 --> 04:18:16.550 align:start position:0%
even though they banked it under the
policy

04:18:16.550 --> 04:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
policy
 
04:18:18.469 --> 04:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
yeah i can tell you my employer doesn't
 
04:18:20.469 --> 04:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
allow banking of sick time it's a use it
 
04:18:23.349 --> 04:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
or lose it the way uh vacation time is
 
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh but to your question i
 
04:18:28.149 --> 04:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
my reading of this would be that
 
04:18:30.469 --> 04:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
employees would not be eligible to be
 
04:18:32.710 --> 04:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
compensated for that banked time if it
 
04:18:35.670 --> 04:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
is identified as is sick time or sick
 
04:18:37.990 --> 04:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
days thank you thank you
 
04:18:38.000 --> 04:18:42.950 align:start position:0%

04:18:44.710 --> 04:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
i see no other individuals wishing to
 
04:18:49.189 --> 04:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:50.790 --> 04:18:50.800 align:start position:0%

04:18:56.149 --> 04:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
good questions i wasn't trying to
 
04:18:57.990 --> 04:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
belittle any of your questions so i
 
04:18:59.670 --> 04:18:59.680 align:start position:0%

i thought i just got to pay cup for a
 
04:19:07.600 --> 04:19:09.349 align:start position:0%
i thought i just got to pay cup for a
minute

04:19:09.349 --> 04:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
minute
 
04:19:12.790 --> 04:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:14.790 --> 04:19:14.800 align:start position:0%

04:19:18.309 --> 04:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
name is bruce berkey
 
04:19:19.750 --> 04:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
managing partner with she infinity
 
04:19:21.910 --> 04:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
capital group and one of our client many
 
04:19:23.349 --> 04:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
of our business clients are concerned
 
04:19:25.429 --> 04:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
about this bill but specifically
 
04:19:27.110 --> 04:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
the national federation of independent
 
04:19:27.120 --> 04:19:28.309 align:start position:0%
the national federation of independent
business

04:19:28.309 --> 04:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:19:31.750 --> 04:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire over 1400 members
 
04:19:33.910 --> 04:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
04:19:35.830 --> 04:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
and as a caveat to one section of the
 
04:19:35.840 --> 04:19:36.630 align:start position:0%
and as a caveat to one section of the
bill

04:19:36.630 --> 04:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:19:38.870 --> 04:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
i would say i don't know specifically
 
04:19:40.309 --> 04:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head but i would say
 
04:19:42.950 --> 04:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
that the majority of them have fewer
 
04:19:45.349 --> 04:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
than 15 employees
 
04:19:48.309 --> 04:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
however that does not
 
04:19:50.790 --> 04:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
have me here supporting the bill
 
04:19:53.110 --> 04:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
nfib is opposed to
 
04:19:53.120 --> 04:19:55.110 align:start position:0%
nfib is opposed to
1514

04:19:55.110 --> 04:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
1514
 
04:19:58.229 --> 04:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
for two specific reasons and one general
 
04:19:58.239 --> 04:19:59.269 align:start position:0%
for two specific reasons and one general
reason

04:19:59.269 --> 04:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
reason
 
04:20:02.149 --> 04:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
i'll get to the two specifics first and
 
04:20:04.550 --> 04:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
and let me also say that uh i've had
 
04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
conversations with representative cahill
 
04:20:08.870 --> 04:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
as well they've been very constructive
 
04:20:10.469 --> 04:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
we have tried to
 
04:20:12.630 --> 04:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
find that common ground
 
04:20:14.389 --> 04:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
we're not quite there yet but i will say
 
04:20:17.030 --> 04:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
that this bill is an improvement over uh
 
04:20:19.830 --> 04:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
previous year's renditions
 
04:20:21.990 --> 04:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
with respect to the two specific uh
 
04:20:26.309 --> 04:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
issues that we have concerns about is um
 
04:20:28.550 --> 04:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
on line four where it talks about the
 
04:20:34.149 --> 04:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:37.750 --> 04:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
that is a concern because any future
 
04:20:40.550 --> 04:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
legislature could reduce that number
 
04:20:41.910 --> 04:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
from 15
 
04:20:43.910 --> 04:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
to 12 to 8
 
04:20:43.920 --> 04:20:45.110 align:start position:0%
to 12 to 8
to

04:20:45.110 --> 04:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
whatever that number may might end up
 
04:20:49.910 --> 04:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
being someday and so it would encompass
 
04:20:51.030 --> 04:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
even more
 
04:20:53.030 --> 04:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
businesses and and then with the
 
04:20:55.030 --> 04:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
negative impacts i'm going to share with
 
04:20:55.040 --> 04:20:56.309 align:start position:0%
negative impacts i'm going to share with
you

04:20:56.309 --> 04:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:20:58.870 --> 04:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
and then the second um
 
04:20:58.880 --> 04:20:59.910 align:start position:0%
and then the second um
specific

04:20:59.910 --> 04:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
specific
 
04:21:03.349 --> 04:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
concern is down in um
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
beginning on line 17
 
04:21:08.870 --> 04:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
where it begins to talk about
 
04:21:11.510 --> 04:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
the result of a layoff
 
04:21:11.520 --> 04:21:13.429 align:start position:0%
the result of a layoff
and

04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:14.389 --> 04:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:21:14.399 --> 04:21:15.349 align:start position:0%
you know
one's

04:21:15.349 --> 04:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
one's
 
04:21:15.359 --> 04:21:18.229 align:start position:0%
one's
termination

04:21:18.229 --> 04:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:19.510 --> 04:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
can be good
 
04:21:22.469 --> 04:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
and once termination can be bad in in
 
04:21:25.830 --> 04:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
the eye of the beholder as they say
 
04:21:28.469 --> 04:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
but certainly because the the law is
 
04:21:30.870 --> 04:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
silent or the proposal is silent and
 
04:21:33.110 --> 04:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
current law is silent
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
if i decide to lay off that individual
 
04:21:38.870 --> 04:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
because they have been embezzling for me
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
i think that i would have a right to as
 
04:21:43.830 --> 04:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
an employer to withhold
 
04:21:46.309 --> 04:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
any extra compensation that might have
 
04:21:50.950 --> 04:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
been earned through vacation time or pto
 
04:21:54.550 --> 04:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
so that that's a concern uh for the nfib
 
04:21:54.560 --> 04:21:55.750 align:start position:0%
so that that's a concern uh for the nfib
members

04:21:55.750 --> 04:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:21:59.269 --> 04:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
nfib opposes the bill because it really
 
04:22:04.469 --> 04:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
is an invasion
 
04:22:06.950 --> 04:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
of the relationship between the employer
 
04:22:09.189 --> 04:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
and the employee
 
04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
and it allows the invasive relationship
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
to exist
 
04:22:16.149 --> 04:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
almost for any reason
 
04:22:18.630 --> 04:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
such as embezzling
 
04:22:18.640 --> 04:22:21.269 align:start position:0%
such as embezzling
um

04:22:21.269 --> 04:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:22.469 --> 04:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
if the
 
04:22:24.710 --> 04:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
what needs to be recognized and adhered
 
04:22:26.950 --> 04:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
to is if the employer
 
04:22:29.910 --> 04:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
has an employee handbook outlining those
 
04:22:32.630 --> 04:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
negotiated benefits
 
04:22:36.389 --> 04:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
whether it be vacation time or pto
 
04:22:36.399 --> 04:22:37.269 align:start position:0%
whether it be vacation time or pto
and

04:22:37.269 --> 04:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:22:39.510 --> 04:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
the employee can be entitled to that
 
04:22:40.790 --> 04:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
time earned
 
04:22:43.030 --> 04:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
but without a written policy
 
04:22:46.389 --> 04:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
an unused vacation time or a pto the
 
04:22:49.750 --> 04:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
employer needs to have that flexibility
 
04:22:52.950 --> 04:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
and how that time is treated
 
04:22:55.429 --> 04:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
laws should not dictate the relationship
 
04:22:57.189 --> 04:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
between the employee
 
04:22:58.630 --> 04:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
and the employer
 
04:23:01.429 --> 04:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
when it comes to this particular area
 
04:23:03.750 --> 04:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
of the relationship
 
04:23:03.760 --> 04:23:04.550 align:start position:0%
of the relationship
so

04:23:04.550 --> 04:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:06.389 --> 04:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
with that i would ask the committee to
 
04:23:09.910 --> 04:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
find 1514 in expedient to legislate
 
04:23:11.590 --> 04:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to try and address any
 
04:23:14.710 --> 04:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
04:23:17.349 --> 04:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
any questions for mr burkey
 
04:23:19.429 --> 04:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
i have one for you
 
04:23:21.269 --> 04:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
what would your members think and i know
 
04:23:23.429 --> 04:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
this is tough because just you know do
 
04:23:25.189 --> 04:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
the best you can in answering it if you
 
04:23:25.199 --> 04:23:26.229 align:start position:0%
the best you can in answering it if you
can

04:23:26.229 --> 04:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:23:27.750 --> 04:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
what would your uh you think your
 
04:23:30.309 --> 04:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
members would say if you took the first
 
04:23:32.630 --> 04:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
lines four through ten
 
04:23:34.710 --> 04:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
and made those required for employees
 
04:23:36.710 --> 04:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
with over a hundred employee
 
04:23:40.550 --> 04:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:44.950 --> 04:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:46.630 --> 04:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
well as a b and c
 
04:23:46.640 --> 04:23:47.429 align:start position:0%
well as a b and c
yeah

04:23:47.429 --> 04:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:23:49.830 --> 04:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
as mr juve said it's smart to have an
 
04:23:52.149 --> 04:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
employee handbook any employer
 
04:23:54.070 --> 04:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
every employer should have one um it's
 
04:23:55.510 --> 04:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
good for the employee it's good for the
 
04:23:55.520 --> 04:23:57.590 align:start position:0%
good for the employee it's good for the
employer

04:23:57.590 --> 04:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
employer
 
04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
and and so we
 
04:24:01.830 --> 04:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
would encourage something like that
 
04:24:01.840 --> 04:24:05.030 align:start position:0%
would encourage something like that
um

04:24:05.030 --> 04:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:07.269 --> 04:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
the number 100
 
04:24:09.110 --> 04:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
certainly better than 15
 
04:24:09.120 --> 04:24:11.990 align:start position:0%
certainly better than 15
and

04:24:11.990 --> 04:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:13.750 --> 04:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
would certainly be preferred over the
 
04:24:16.149 --> 04:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
current language
 
04:24:17.910 --> 04:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:24:19.349 --> 04:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:24:21.189 --> 04:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
somebody how did you
 
04:24:25.510 --> 04:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:26.950 --> 04:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you for
 
04:24:29.030 --> 04:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
taking the question you classified this
 
04:24:31.590 --> 04:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
bill as a quote invasion of the
 
04:24:33.189 --> 04:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
relationship between employer and
 
04:24:33.199 --> 04:24:34.469 align:start position:0%
relationship between employer and
employee

04:24:34.469 --> 04:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
employee
 
04:24:36.870 --> 04:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
where would the organization that you
 
04:24:39.429 --> 04:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
represent draw the line
 
04:24:41.429 --> 04:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
as to what is considered an invasion and
 
04:24:44.469 --> 04:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
what isn't and i can provide an example
 
04:24:44.479 --> 04:24:45.670 align:start position:0%
what isn't and i can provide an example
um

04:24:45.670 --> 04:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:47.910 --> 04:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
would the organization consider osha
 
04:24:50.149 --> 04:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
regulations an invasion between
 
04:24:53.269 --> 04:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
employers in the employer relationship
 
04:24:55.349 --> 04:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative for the
 
04:24:58.630 --> 04:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
question um i will say that the nfib
 
04:25:01.510 --> 04:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
nationally opposed um the osha
 
04:25:03.110 --> 04:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
regulations when it came to vaccine
 
04:25:05.269 --> 04:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
mandates for i think it was employers
 
04:25:07.910 --> 04:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
over 100
 
04:25:10.070 --> 04:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
and so in general
 
04:25:13.670 --> 04:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
the nfib does oppose greater and further
 
04:25:16.630 --> 04:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
regulation where it's not necessary
 
04:25:19.189 --> 04:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
we've had regulation for many many years
 
04:25:20.950 --> 04:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt about that
 
04:25:23.110 --> 04:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
and some of it has come about as a
 
04:25:26.550 --> 04:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
result of some some very bad experiences
 
04:25:26.560 --> 04:25:27.510 align:start position:0%
result of some some very bad experiences
and

04:25:27.510 --> 04:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:25:30.229 --> 04:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
so the the business community has
 
04:25:32.229 --> 04:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
learned to live with those they have
 
04:25:34.630 --> 04:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
built those regulations into the costs
 
04:25:36.550 --> 04:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
of what they produce in terms of when
 
04:25:38.469 --> 04:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
they sell their products
 
04:25:38.479 --> 04:25:40.550 align:start position:0%
they sell their products
and

04:25:40.550 --> 04:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:25:42.870 --> 04:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
the preference will be not to have
 
04:25:45.110 --> 04:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
further regulations if it can be if it
 
04:25:47.750 --> 04:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
can be addressed in a matter through an
 
04:25:51.269 --> 04:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:53.269 --> 04:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh just for clarification prior to the
 
04:25:54.870 --> 04:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
question uh i wasn't referring to the
 
04:25:56.550 --> 04:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate i was referring to osha
 
04:25:59.110 --> 04:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
regulations more broadly
 
04:26:00.950 --> 04:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
and i'll throw out another example just
 
04:26:03.269 --> 04:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
to try to establish where this line is
 
04:26:05.189 --> 04:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh regarding the
 
04:26:07.349 --> 04:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
description of an invasion uh a
 
04:26:09.030 --> 04:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
requirement that people get paid for the
 
04:26:10.950 --> 04:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
time they work
 
04:26:13.030 --> 04:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
if an employee
 
04:26:15.590 --> 04:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
determines that an employer would not
 
04:26:17.830 --> 04:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
pay them for that time worked wouldn't
 
04:26:20.070 --> 04:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
the free market establish that people
 
04:26:21.349 --> 04:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
just shouldn't work for that employer
 
04:26:23.510 --> 04:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
anymore i'm just trying to ascertain
 
04:26:25.349 --> 04:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
where the line is here because i think
 
04:26:27.510 --> 04:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
this is something along the lines of
 
04:26:29.349 --> 04:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
getting paid for the work you've done
 
04:26:32.469 --> 04:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
sure uh thank you for your question i i
 
04:26:34.389 --> 04:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
you know i don't think there's a bright
 
04:26:37.429 --> 04:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
red line uh in any of this
 
04:26:39.429 --> 04:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
currently there's law laws on the books
 
04:26:41.670 --> 04:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
with respect to pay
 
04:26:43.349 --> 04:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
and and i'm sure that
 
04:26:45.590 --> 04:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner ogden would be all
 
04:26:45.600 --> 04:26:46.389 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner ogden would be all
over

04:26:46.389 --> 04:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:26:48.149 --> 04:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
my members or any employer in the state
 
04:26:49.510 --> 04:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire if they did not pay the
 
04:26:52.229 --> 04:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
wages that have been earned
 
04:26:54.550 --> 04:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
i think in in this instance
 
04:26:56.469 --> 04:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
04:26:58.550 --> 04:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
contract moving forward between the
 
04:27:01.110 --> 04:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
employer and the employee with respect
 
04:27:03.590 --> 04:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
to the overall package
 
04:27:05.670 --> 04:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
that an employee signs up for when they
 
04:27:08.149 --> 04:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
go to work for a particular employer
 
04:27:10.389 --> 04:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
and that package is is
 
04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know outlined hopefully in a
 
04:27:14.469 --> 04:27:14.479 align:start position:0%
employee handbook
 
04:27:16.870 --> 04:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
and that the employee has full knowledge
 
04:27:16.880 --> 04:27:17.750 align:start position:0%
and that the employee has full knowledge
of

04:27:17.750 --> 04:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:27:20.469 --> 04:27:20.479 align:start position:0%
how that relationship for
 
04:27:22.389 --> 04:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
while they're there and when they decide
 
04:27:24.550 --> 04:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
to leave
 
04:27:27.030 --> 04:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:27:28.790 --> 04:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you mr
 
04:27:31.510 --> 04:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
berkeys um
 
04:27:33.910 --> 04:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
as mr duvey has said and you and you
 
04:27:35.750 --> 04:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
have said um
 
04:27:38.950 --> 04:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
the expectation is that the um terms of
 
04:27:41.030 --> 04:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
employment the uh
 
04:27:43.189 --> 04:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:27:45.830 --> 04:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines or the manual for employment
 
04:27:47.990 --> 04:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
we'll be clear on this and obviously we
 
04:27:49.910 --> 04:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
all would share that view of course in
 
04:27:51.510 --> 04:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
law most of the
 
04:27:53.910 --> 04:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
disputes arise from places where
 
04:27:55.910 --> 04:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
something was left unclarified and the
 
04:27:55.920 --> 04:27:57.429 align:start position:0%
something was left unclarified and the
point

04:27:57.429 --> 04:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:27:59.750 --> 04:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
about what
 
04:28:01.990 --> 04:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
the expectations of the parties then
 
04:28:02.000 --> 04:28:02.790 align:start position:0%
the expectations of the parties then
would

04:28:02.790 --> 04:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:28:05.030 --> 04:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
would become a central question to the
 
04:28:05.830 --> 04:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
extent you can
 
04:28:05.840 --> 04:28:07.590 align:start position:0%
extent you can

speak

speak
 
04:28:11.830 --> 04:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
for your membership companies do you
 
04:28:14.070 --> 04:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
think they would consider
 
04:28:14.080 --> 04:28:15.269 align:start position:0%
think they would consider
that

04:28:15.269 --> 04:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:28:15.279 --> 04:28:16.469 align:start position:0%
that
a

04:28:16.469 --> 04:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:28:19.110 --> 04:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
clarity like this in law
 
04:28:21.110 --> 04:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
would both reduce
 
04:28:22.790 --> 04:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
the chance for
 
04:28:25.830 --> 04:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
litigation and or regulatory
 
04:28:25.840 --> 04:28:26.870 align:start position:0%
litigation and or regulatory
action

04:28:26.870 --> 04:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
action
 
04:28:26.880 --> 04:28:28.389 align:start position:0%
action
and

04:28:28.389 --> 04:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:28:30.149 --> 04:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
reduce the
 
04:28:32.710 --> 04:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
displeasure and
 
04:28:35.110 --> 04:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
hits to reputation and other
 
04:28:37.349 --> 04:28:37.359 align:start position:0%
adverse effects from
 
04:28:37.359 --> 04:28:38.550 align:start position:0%
adverse effects from
a

04:28:38.550 --> 04:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:28:40.950 --> 04:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
a position taken by companies on this
 
04:28:43.110 --> 04:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
issue which would run contrary to
 
04:28:46.870 --> 04:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectations of the employee
 
04:28:48.790 --> 04:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative manaver
 
04:28:52.469 --> 04:28:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:54.870 --> 04:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
yes perhaps a law like this would add
 
04:28:54.880 --> 04:28:56.229 align:start position:0%
yes perhaps a law like this would add
clarity

04:28:56.229 --> 04:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
clarity
 
04:28:58.790 --> 04:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
but i think a law like this would also
 
04:29:01.429 --> 04:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
have an impact on compensation for
 
04:29:03.510 --> 04:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
employees down the line
 
04:29:05.269 --> 04:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
i think that this
 
04:29:06.550 --> 04:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
by by
 
04:29:06.560 --> 04:29:07.990 align:start position:0%
by by
by

04:29:07.990 --> 04:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:29:10.950 --> 04:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
putting employers into a box
 
04:29:12.710 --> 04:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
on this
 
04:29:15.030 --> 04:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
you you lose the flexibility that the
 
04:29:18.309 --> 04:29:18.319 align:start position:0%
employer has in terms of what they want
 
04:29:20.149 --> 04:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
what they're going to be able to offer
 
04:29:22.229 --> 04:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
to that employee
 
04:29:28.790 --> 04:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:30.070 --> 04:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions thank you
 
04:29:35.349 --> 04:29:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:36.710 --> 04:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
i say that right
 
04:29:39.189 --> 04:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
milioto yeah
 
04:29:41.590 --> 04:29:41.600 align:start position:0%

we service small to mid-sized businesses
 
04:29:53.590 --> 04:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
for hr consulting
 
04:29:54.870 --> 04:29:54.880 align:start position:0%

to speak in opposition of house bill
 
04:29:56.640 --> 04:29:58.229 align:start position:0%
to speak in opposition of house bill
1514

04:29:58.229 --> 04:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
1514
 
04:29:59.910 --> 04:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
currently our state is suffering from
 
04:30:02.389 --> 04:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
labor shortages a mental health crisis
 
04:30:04.630 --> 04:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
and massive resignation wave employers
 
04:30:06.550 --> 04:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
are having to work twice as hard to
 
04:30:09.429 --> 04:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
attract and retain quality employees
 
04:30:11.510 --> 04:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
employees are able to call the shots
 
04:30:13.110 --> 04:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
they're requesting well above market
 
04:30:16.469 --> 04:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
wages and are often receiving them
 
04:30:18.149 --> 04:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
i believe this proposal proposed
 
04:30:20.229 --> 04:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
legislation is coming at a time when we
 
04:30:21.990 --> 04:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
need to be figuring out how to help
 
04:30:24.149 --> 04:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
employers stay in business and not add
 
04:30:26.590 --> 04:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
more layers of complex complex
 
04:30:29.189 --> 04:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
complexity and liability when trying to
 
04:30:31.510 --> 04:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
make business decisions
 
04:30:33.110 --> 04:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
if you were to be let go from your job
 
04:30:34.950 --> 04:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
today how long do you think it would
 
04:30:37.510 --> 04:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
take to be gainfully employed again and
 
04:30:40.229 --> 04:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
i'm talking in almost every industry
 
04:30:42.790 --> 04:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
i would argue less than a week
 
04:30:45.189 --> 04:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
in this proposed legislation it states
 
04:30:47.510 --> 04:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
that if an employee gives notice in good
 
04:30:49.830 --> 04:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
standing they are to be paid all accrued
 
04:30:51.349 --> 04:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
vacation time
 
04:30:53.269 --> 04:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
so as a small business owner with 20
 
04:30:55.910 --> 04:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
employees i now need to try and fill a
 
04:30:58.070 --> 04:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
position in a labor market that makes
 
04:31:00.630 --> 04:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
that near impossible while still paying
 
04:31:02.309 --> 04:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
someone that has made the personal
 
04:31:04.710 --> 04:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
decision to leave my business
 
04:31:06.229 --> 04:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
what safety net are we providing
 
04:31:09.110 --> 04:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
employers for bad employees while we
 
04:31:11.110 --> 04:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
don't like to make laws for them we do
 
04:31:12.790 --> 04:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
need to consider them while making
 
04:31:15.750 --> 04:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that would benefit them
 
04:31:18.389 --> 04:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
jane doe can now hop from job to job
 
04:31:20.309 --> 04:31:20.319 align:start position:0%
just staying long enough to cash in on
 
04:31:22.070 --> 04:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
her vacation pay
 
04:31:24.070 --> 04:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
now you may suggest that it's her next
 
04:31:26.870 --> 04:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
employer due diligence process before
 
04:31:26.880 --> 04:31:28.149 align:start position:0%
employer due diligence process before
hiring

04:31:28.149 --> 04:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
hiring
 
04:31:30.550 --> 04:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
well unfortunately we're only able to
 
04:31:32.389 --> 04:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
ask certain questions to her prior
 
04:31:32.399 --> 04:31:33.590 align:start position:0%
ask certain questions to her prior
employer

04:31:33.590 --> 04:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
employer
 
04:31:36.389 --> 04:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
and we've all met jane she's a great
 
04:31:36.399 --> 04:31:37.590 align:start position:0%
and we've all met jane she's a great
actress

04:31:37.590 --> 04:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
actress
 
04:31:39.830 --> 04:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
and that's right the only person that
 
04:31:41.110 --> 04:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
showed up for the interview for this
 
04:31:44.070 --> 04:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
position the pickings are slim
 
04:31:45.910 --> 04:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
i want to offer paid time off to be
 
04:31:47.990 --> 04:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
competitive as an employer
 
04:31:50.229 --> 04:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
if this legislation passes
 
04:31:52.149 --> 04:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
do i add a long waiting period to
 
04:31:53.670 --> 04:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
protect myself
 
04:31:55.750 --> 04:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
in turn diminishing the benefits for
 
04:31:55.760 --> 04:31:57.110 align:start position:0%
in turn diminishing the benefits for
most

04:31:57.110 --> 04:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
most
 
04:31:59.349 --> 04:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
for simplicity and administration and
 
04:32:01.750 --> 04:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
enhanced benefits to a lot of our client
 
04:32:04.070 --> 04:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
in and enhanced benefits a lot of our
 
04:32:06.469 --> 04:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
clients have stopped separating sick
 
04:32:08.790 --> 04:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
time from vacation time and they just
 
04:32:11.189 --> 04:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
lump it together as paid time off if
 
04:32:13.750 --> 04:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
you're never sick great you get a bonus
 
04:32:15.830 --> 04:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
five days to spend at the beach
 
04:32:18.389 --> 04:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
having staff take scheduled time off is
 
04:32:20.550 --> 04:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
easier for a business to manage
 
04:32:22.630 --> 04:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
most businesses encourage their staff to
 
04:32:25.750 --> 04:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
take scheduled time off versus sick time
 
04:32:28.149 --> 04:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
this legislation encourage encourages
 
04:32:30.630 --> 04:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
employers to split sick time from
 
04:32:33.429 --> 04:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
vacation time to protect their liability
 
04:32:35.830 --> 04:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
again decreasing the benefits for most
 
04:32:35.840 --> 04:32:37.510 align:start position:0%
again decreasing the benefits for most
employees

04:32:37.510 --> 04:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:32:39.269 --> 04:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
as a company we would like to allow our
 
04:32:40.870 --> 04:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
staff to have their time available at
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the annual period so
 
04:32:44.229 --> 04:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
that they can take it when it is best
 
04:32:46.149 --> 04:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
for them and their family this is
 
04:32:48.389 --> 04:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
commonly called front loaded
 
04:32:50.309 --> 04:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
with the proposed legislation employers
 
04:32:52.070 --> 04:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
are going to need to be cautious of
 
04:32:53.349 --> 04:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
front loading
 
04:32:55.429 --> 04:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
time for their staff this legislation
 
04:32:57.189 --> 04:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
encourages them to have it on a cruel
 
04:32:57.199 --> 04:32:58.229 align:start position:0%
encourages them to have it on a cruel
basis

04:32:58.229 --> 04:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
basis
 
04:32:59.750 --> 04:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
have you ever worked for a company with
 
04:33:01.750 --> 04:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
an accrual the system and had to tell
 
04:33:03.429 --> 04:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
your wife that you couldn't go to disney
 
04:33:05.429 --> 04:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
on february vacation because you have
 
04:33:07.510 --> 04:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
not yet accrued enough time
 
04:33:09.429 --> 04:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
again this legislation is encouraging
 
04:33:10.869 --> 04:33:10.879 align:start position:0%
employers to provide a diminished
 
04:33:12.869 --> 04:33:12.879 align:start position:0%
benefit for their good employees to
 
04:33:14.230 --> 04:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
ensure they are protecting themselves
 
04:33:16.789 --> 04:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
from the liability they cannot control
 
04:33:18.150 --> 04:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
when a business puts together their
 
04:33:19.910 --> 04:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
budget for labor for the year it
 
04:33:22.390 --> 04:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
accounts for someone's annual earnings
 
04:33:24.230 --> 04:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
the annual amount includes the benefit
 
04:33:26.949 --> 04:33:26.959 align:start position:0%
of time off if you're here you're paid
 
04:33:28.789 --> 04:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
to work and if you have your time off
 
04:33:30.470 --> 04:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
available then you're paid to
 
04:33:31.750 --> 04:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
stay home
 
04:33:34.150 --> 04:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
even with this benefit the annual amount
 
04:33:36.789 --> 04:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
does not exceed that of an annual amount
 
04:33:39.029 --> 04:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
with this legislation employers now need
 
04:33:40.629 --> 04:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
to have a line item in their budget for
 
04:33:43.029 --> 04:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
the liability of all earned time not yet
 
04:33:46.070 --> 04:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
taken if you quit i now need to pay for
 
04:33:46.080 --> 04:33:46.789 align:start position:0%
taken if you quit i now need to pay for
you

04:33:46.789 --> 04:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:33:48.629 --> 04:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
pay you for weeks that you are not going
 
04:33:51.029 --> 04:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
to be working and god willing i have
 
04:33:52.709 --> 04:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
actually replaced you and also now
 
04:33:54.629 --> 04:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
paying someone else new to do the same
 
04:33:54.639 --> 04:33:55.429 align:start position:0%
paying someone else new to do the same
job

04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
job
 
04:33:57.590 --> 04:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
therefore paying in excess the annual
 
04:33:59.590 --> 04:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
amount i originally budgeted
 
04:34:01.510 --> 04:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
if we experience a high turnover that
 
04:34:03.750 --> 04:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
could drastically impact our business
 
04:34:06.230 --> 04:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
and our budget as a small business
 
04:34:07.510 --> 04:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
let's look at some industries
 
04:34:09.990 --> 04:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
specifically how about restaurants
 
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
they typically will have more than 15
 
04:34:11.760 --> 04:34:13.109 align:start position:0%
they typically will have more than 15
employees

04:34:13.109 --> 04:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:34:14.949 --> 04:34:14.959 align:start position:0%
super competitive industry when it comes
 
04:34:17.349 --> 04:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
to labor and they want to add great
 
04:34:18.869 --> 04:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
benefits so they can start attracting
 
04:34:20.150 --> 04:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
great employees
 
04:34:21.910 --> 04:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
be careful that one's going to get
 
04:34:21.920 --> 04:34:23.349 align:start position:0%
be careful that one's going to get
expensive

04:34:23.349 --> 04:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
04:34:25.269 --> 04:34:25.279 align:start position:0%
it is proposing this legislation that
 
04:34:27.109 --> 04:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
the unused vacation time would have to
 
04:34:29.990 --> 04:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
be paid by the next regular pay cycle
 
04:34:31.109 --> 04:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
04:34:35.189 --> 04:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
direct contradiction to rsa 275 44 that
 
04:34:37.510 --> 04:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
indicates upon termination an employer
 
04:34:40.709 --> 04:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
has 72 hours to pay all due wages in
 
04:34:43.429 --> 04:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
full yet again complicating the process
 
04:34:45.269 --> 04:34:45.279 align:start position:0%
for your employers
 
04:34:47.189 --> 04:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion i feel that this
 
04:34:49.349 --> 04:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
legislation will push employers to offer
 
04:34:51.510 --> 04:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
diminished benefits and reward employees
 
04:34:53.510 --> 04:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
for changing their place of employment
 
04:34:55.990 --> 04:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
an employer often cannot control an
 
04:34:58.150 --> 04:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
employee's decision to leave employment
 
04:35:00.150 --> 04:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
why should they be rewarded
 
04:35:01.750 --> 04:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
in closing i also have an additional
 
04:35:03.750 --> 04:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
question that should be considered how
 
04:35:05.109 --> 04:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
is this going to affect people that
 
04:35:07.349 --> 04:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
offer unlimited time policies
 
04:35:09.590 --> 04:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
it is a very hard it is very hard to
 
04:35:11.510 --> 04:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
create legislation that is one size fits
 
04:35:13.830 --> 04:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
all should we not let private employers
 
04:35:15.750 --> 04:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
determine their policy based on their
 
04:35:18.709 --> 04:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
business needs industry and labor market
 
04:35:20.949 --> 04:35:20.959 align:start position:0%
employees have the ability to ask these
 
04:35:23.189 --> 04:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
questions and know in the hiring process
 
04:35:24.949 --> 04:35:24.959 align:start position:0%
how their potential employer handles
 
04:35:26.949 --> 04:35:26.959 align:start position:0%
time off upon termination
 
04:35:29.429 --> 04:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
in the current landscape and labor pool
 
04:35:31.830 --> 04:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
to me it doesn't justify a bill of this
 
04:35:31.840 --> 04:35:32.789 align:start position:0%
to me it doesn't justify a bill of this
measure

04:35:32.789 --> 04:35:32.799 align:start position:0%
measure
 
04:35:35.189 --> 04:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
and i did just want to add after hearing
 
04:35:38.789 --> 04:35:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:38.799 --> 04:35:40.070 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:35:40.070 --> 04:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:35:41.910 --> 04:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
current legislation
 
04:35:44.150 --> 04:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
in my understanding and interpretation
 
04:35:45.750 --> 04:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire if you do
 
04:35:48.949 --> 04:35:48.959 align:start position:0%
not have a written policy that dictates
 
04:35:51.029 --> 04:35:51.039 align:start position:0%
what happens to your time off upon
 
04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
termination whether voluntary or
 
04:35:55.750 --> 04:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
involuntary you are to be paid for it
 
04:35:58.789 --> 04:35:58.799 align:start position:0%
so if your company chooses not to write
 
04:36:01.349 --> 04:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
a policy the state does protect the
 
04:36:03.429 --> 04:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
employee and you are required to pay it
 
04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
out i have case instances of clients
 
04:36:08.230 --> 04:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
that i've supported that have had to pay
 
04:36:09.910 --> 04:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
out weeks vacation because they did not
 
04:36:11.510 --> 04:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
have a written policy
 
04:36:13.349 --> 04:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
i would agree that when you're going
 
04:36:16.390 --> 04:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
into employment with somebody uh that
 
04:36:18.390 --> 04:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
you're making an agreement
 
04:36:20.390 --> 04:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
you are agreeing to terms of your
 
04:36:22.709 --> 04:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
employment and this is something that
 
04:36:24.629 --> 04:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
your employer should be dictating do i
 
04:36:26.390 --> 04:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
feel that you should write policy
 
04:36:28.709 --> 04:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
requiring them to dictate it no but i
 
04:36:30.629 --> 04:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
believe that the statute already
 
04:36:32.629 --> 04:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
protects them should you choose not to
 
04:36:35.269 --> 04:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
dictate how to play in the sandbox
 
04:36:36.709 --> 04:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
that there is already legislation
 
04:36:38.070 --> 04:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
protecting them
 
04:36:39.590 --> 04:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
if you choose not to dictate how that
 
04:36:43.349 --> 04:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:44.830 --> 04:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:36:47.189 --> 04:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
representative you mr chairman
 
04:36:47.199 --> 04:36:48.070 align:start position:0%
representative you mr chairman
um

04:36:48.070 --> 04:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:50.230 --> 04:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
i want to follow up on the question that
 
04:36:53.109 --> 04:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
you asked at the end about companies uh
 
04:36:55.349 --> 04:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
with unlimited time off statutes how
 
04:36:56.949 --> 04:36:56.959 align:start position:0%
many companies do you represent that
 
04:37:00.310 --> 04:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
offer unlimited paid time off
 
04:37:02.070 --> 04:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh off the top of my head i would not
 
04:37:04.150 --> 04:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
have a number but i would say it is very
 
04:37:06.390 --> 04:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
industry specific there are certain
 
04:37:07.990 --> 04:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
industries a lot of tech companies are
 
04:37:10.390 --> 04:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
going to unlimited time off a lot of
 
04:37:13.830 --> 04:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
law firms it's the higher white-collared
 
04:37:15.429 --> 04:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
companies that are typically doing the
 
04:37:18.390 --> 04:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
unlimited time off follow-up follow-up
 
04:37:20.390 --> 04:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
just to clarify i'm talking about
 
04:37:23.670 --> 04:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
unlimited paid time off correct as am i
 
04:37:25.510 --> 04:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
like you never have to come in
 
04:37:28.070 --> 04:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
no so policy states that you still do
 
04:37:30.551 --> 04:37:30.561 align:start position:0%
have to request time off but there is
 
04:37:32.310 --> 04:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
not a cap on the amount of time it's
 
04:37:34.390 --> 04:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
usually in industries like you've heard
 
04:37:36.310 --> 04:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
from several gentlemen today that always
 
04:37:38.070 --> 04:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
lose time it's the industries where
 
04:37:39.429 --> 04:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
people are not taking the time they're
 
04:37:41.189 --> 04:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
provided so rather than telling you you
 
04:37:42.709 --> 04:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
get to take five weeks but you only ever
 
04:37:44.470 --> 04:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
take three we tell you take however much
 
04:37:46.629 --> 04:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
time you ever want those industries
 
04:37:48.470 --> 04:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
typically are not taking time off that
 
04:37:50.551 --> 04:37:50.561 align:start position:0%
your dedicated workers that are working
 
04:37:52.789 --> 04:37:52.799 align:start position:0%
50 to 60 hours a week they're not taking
 
04:37:55.510 --> 04:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
time off follow up
 
04:37:57.189 --> 04:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh you talked
 
04:38:00.070 --> 04:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
about um this creating a burden on
 
04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
employers to
 
04:38:03.750 --> 04:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh have to pay these benefits out how
 
04:38:05.830 --> 04:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
many minutes would it take for
 
04:38:08.949 --> 04:38:08.959 align:start position:0%
an employer that you represent uh to sit
 
04:38:12.310 --> 04:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
down and uh do the cash out option for
 
04:38:15.029 --> 04:38:15.039 align:start position:0%
these benefits where this lot of pass
 
04:38:17.029 --> 04:38:17.039 align:start position:0%
can you rephrase the question
 
04:38:18.629 --> 04:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
you're asking me how much time it takes
 
04:38:22.869 --> 04:38:22.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:24.310 --> 04:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
the time to cut a check would be
 
04:38:26.470 --> 04:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
probably less than five minutes thank
 
04:38:26.480 --> 04:38:28.390 align:start position:0%
probably less than five minutes thank
you

04:38:28.390 --> 04:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:38:34.629 --> 04:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:37.029 --> 04:38:37.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
04:38:39.510 --> 04:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
for some of us who've only worked for
 
04:38:41.109 --> 04:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
larger firms and that's all we're
 
04:38:43.269 --> 04:38:43.279 align:start position:0%
familiar with you made some statements
 
04:38:43.279 --> 04:38:44.310 align:start position:0%
familiar with you made some statements
that

04:38:44.310 --> 04:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:38:44.320 --> 04:38:45.189 align:start position:0%
that
uh

04:38:45.189 --> 04:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:38:47.470 --> 04:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
might be a little confusing you kind of
 
04:38:50.470 --> 04:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
differentiated between
 
04:38:54.470 --> 04:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
the cost of paying a long time employee
 
04:38:57.029 --> 04:38:57.039 align:start position:0%
well they take a couple of weeks off and
 
04:38:58.949 --> 04:38:58.959 align:start position:0%
you shuffle the schedule
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
to account for that
 
04:39:02.629 --> 04:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
and the cost of paying people who don't
 
04:39:04.551 --> 04:39:04.561 align:start position:0%
work for you anymore and that that's a
 
04:39:08.949 --> 04:39:08.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:11.189 --> 04:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
the pay rate for two weeks
 
04:39:13.189 --> 04:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
you implied those are very different
 
04:39:13.199 --> 04:39:15.109 align:start position:0%
you implied those are very different
situations

04:39:15.109 --> 04:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
situations
 
04:39:17.429 --> 04:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
on the employer's books could you help
 
04:39:18.869 --> 04:39:18.879 align:start position:0%
some of us understand absolutely thank
 
04:39:20.230 --> 04:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
you for the question and i'd love to
 
04:39:23.349 --> 04:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
clarify so i was describing um you work
 
04:39:26.789 --> 04:39:26.799 align:start position:0%
for me i've allocated 50 000 a year for
 
04:39:29.429 --> 04:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
your salary so you're going to work 48
 
04:39:30.869 --> 04:39:30.879 align:start position:0%
weeks and i'm gonna pay you for four
 
04:39:32.789 --> 04:39:32.799 align:start position:0%
weeks to be off but i'm still paying you
 
04:39:34.869 --> 04:39:34.879 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars for the year
 
04:39:37.109 --> 04:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
you leave halfway through i now need to
 
04:39:39.590 --> 04:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
pay you out the four weeks of time but
 
04:39:41.350 --> 04:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
i've also replaced you
 
04:39:44.230 --> 04:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm now in the rears of four weeks
 
04:39:45.750 --> 04:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
that i've had to pay you in excess
 
04:39:47.430 --> 04:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
because i've filled your position so
 
04:39:49.510 --> 04:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
while i allocated fifty thousand dollars
 
04:39:51.590 --> 04:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
for that position for the year i've now
 
04:39:54.150 --> 04:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
gone over by let's call it four thousand
 
04:39:56.070 --> 04:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
dollars in my budget because i'm paying
 
04:39:58.070 --> 04:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
you not to be here but yet i've now
 
04:39:59.750 --> 04:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
hired representative callum to take your
 
04:40:02.230 --> 04:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
place so i'm paying him to actually work
 
04:40:05.110 --> 04:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
while you're getting paid
 
04:40:07.750 --> 04:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
and i would like to also add for small
 
04:40:09.430 --> 04:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
businesses to come up with that kind of
 
04:40:09.440 --> 04:40:10.390 align:start position:0%
businesses to come up with that kind of
money

04:40:10.390 --> 04:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:40:12.150 --> 04:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
on a consistent basis and have that
 
04:40:14.390 --> 04:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
liability on their books that you could
 
04:40:16.070 --> 04:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
choose to leave at any time and i can't
 
04:40:17.270 --> 04:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
control that
 
04:40:20.070 --> 04:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
to then carry that weight is is a big
 
04:40:21.270 --> 04:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
burden for a lot of small business
 
04:40:21.280 --> 04:40:25.910 align:start position:0%
burden for a lot of small business
owners

04:40:25.910 --> 04:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:27.190 --> 04:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'd like to thank
 
04:40:29.270 --> 04:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony is very succinct
 
04:40:31.110 --> 04:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
and articulate and can we get a copy of
 
04:40:31.120 --> 04:40:31.910 align:start position:0%
and articulate and can we get a copy of
it

04:40:31.910 --> 04:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:40:36.470 --> 04:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:38.390 --> 04:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
could the chairman get it and give it to
 
04:40:40.868 --> 04:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
the committee we'll do so thank you and
 
04:40:43.110 --> 04:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question yes
 
04:40:44.470 --> 04:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
could you explain
 
04:40:46.230 --> 04:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
a little bit more in detail between a
 
04:40:48.070 --> 04:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
front load and then an accrual basis it
 
04:40:49.030 --> 04:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
might have
 
04:40:50.788 --> 04:40:50.798 align:start position:0%
confused a few people yeah thank you for
 
04:40:52.628 --> 04:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
the question and i do realize after
 
04:40:54.550 --> 04:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
sitting through the earlier testimonies
 
04:40:56.628 --> 04:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
and questions um that that might be
 
04:41:00.070 --> 04:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
addressed partially in the verbiage
 
04:41:01.750 --> 04:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
where it says that it would be prorated
 
04:41:05.510 --> 04:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
which i do agree is this a very vague
 
04:41:07.750 --> 04:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
statement so front loading someone's
 
04:41:09.670 --> 04:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
time off let's say everyone gets their
 
04:41:11.830 --> 04:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
time on january 1st everyone gets a
 
04:41:14.150 --> 04:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
refresh companies that front load on
 
04:41:15.750 --> 04:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
january 1st you would get your full
 
04:41:18.310 --> 04:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
annual amount in your bank of pto so if
 
04:41:20.150 --> 04:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
you're four weeks in the year you get
 
04:41:21.910 --> 04:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
four weeks available on january 1st to
 
04:41:23.430 --> 04:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
do what you would like if you're an
 
04:41:25.510 --> 04:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
accrual basis they take the four weeks
 
04:41:27.110 --> 04:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
and they divide it amongst all your pay
 
04:41:29.110 --> 04:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
periods so each week when you work you
 
04:41:31.430 --> 04:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
accrue a little bit of time so therefore
 
04:41:34.150 --> 04:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
it takes time for you to build up a bank
 
04:41:35.990 --> 04:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
commonly we do see with clients that
 
04:41:38.150 --> 04:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
offer an accrual system uh that they do
 
04:41:39.830 --> 04:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
allow carryovers so everyone's not
 
04:41:41.750 --> 04:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
starting at zero on january they do
 
04:41:44.070 --> 04:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
often accompany an accrual
 
04:41:46.310 --> 04:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
policy with
 
04:41:51.430 --> 04:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:53.030 --> 04:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for the
 
04:41:55.190 --> 04:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up um
 
04:41:57.590 --> 04:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
so a employer who front loads and then
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
an employee takes all their time and
 
04:42:02.550 --> 04:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
then february 1 says hey i'm quitting
 
04:42:04.708 --> 04:42:04.718 align:start position:0%
how does the employer recoup that
 
04:42:08.310 --> 04:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
four weeks vacation pay under this law
 
04:42:10.628 --> 04:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question uh that's
 
04:42:12.070 --> 04:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
actually a
 
04:42:13.750 --> 04:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
reason that a lot of employers will go
 
04:42:16.070 --> 04:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
to an accrual system there is no current
 
04:42:18.868 --> 04:42:18.878 align:start position:0%
legislation that protects an employer uh
 
04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
there is no amount due it's not an iou
 
04:42:23.510 --> 04:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
and this legislation doesn't address
 
04:42:25.990 --> 04:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
that concern at all so it
 
04:42:27.750 --> 04:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say it's one-sided but
 
04:42:30.708 --> 04:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
it is a little one-sided in that uh
 
04:42:32.550 --> 04:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
there is no protection again for the
 
04:42:34.708 --> 04:42:34.718 align:start position:0%
employer if you choose to take all of
 
04:42:37.270 --> 04:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
your vacation which does happen we we
 
04:42:39.030 --> 04:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
commonly suggest that our clients do the
 
04:42:41.190 --> 04:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
accrual base for that reason
 
04:42:43.030 --> 04:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
so you're not overpaying before the
 
04:42:45.990 --> 04:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:48.070 --> 04:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
04:42:49.430 --> 04:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for your
 
04:42:49.440 --> 04:42:50.470 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for your
testimony

04:42:50.470 --> 04:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:42:52.310 --> 04:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
i may have misunderstood it though and i
 
04:42:54.628 --> 04:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
just want to be sure i am understanding
 
04:42:57.590 --> 04:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
it correctly i thought you had said that
 
04:43:00.310 --> 04:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
say in the instance of a company with
 
04:43:03.750 --> 04:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
20 employees and they have a employee
 
04:43:05.990 --> 04:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
manual and it says
 
04:43:07.910 --> 04:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
you'll accrue
 
04:43:07.920 --> 04:43:08.948 align:start position:0%
you'll accrue
a

04:43:08.948 --> 04:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:43:08.958 --> 04:43:10.230 align:start position:0%
a
one-week

04:43:10.230 --> 04:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
one-week
 
04:43:10.240 --> 04:43:11.670 align:start position:0%
one-week
vacation

04:43:11.670 --> 04:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
vacation
 
04:43:13.510 --> 04:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
period for each year you work up to a
 
04:43:15.750 --> 04:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
maximum of five
 
04:43:17.590 --> 04:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
and so you've worked as an employee for
 
04:43:19.270 --> 04:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
this company for
 
04:43:22.550 --> 04:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
um 15 or 20 years or something and
 
04:43:24.708 --> 04:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
there's a layoff
 
04:43:26.150 --> 04:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
that came out of the blue because of
 
04:43:28.230 --> 04:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
market conditions or whatever it was
 
04:43:28.240 --> 04:43:31.030 align:start position:0%
market conditions or whatever it was
and

04:43:31.030 --> 04:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:32.470 --> 04:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
you have
 
04:43:35.190 --> 04:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh not taken any of your it's it's
 
04:43:36.230 --> 04:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
almost the end of the year and you
 
04:43:37.830 --> 04:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
haven't taken any vacation
 
04:43:37.840 --> 04:43:40.628 align:start position:0%
haven't taken any vacation
um

04:43:40.628 --> 04:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:41.910 --> 04:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
is it
 
04:43:44.150 --> 04:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
is it your testimony that under current
 
04:43:45.670 --> 04:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
law or
 
04:43:49.030 --> 04:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
regulation that that
 
04:43:50.948 --> 04:43:50.958 align:start position:0%
employer under those circumstances has
 
04:43:52.708 --> 04:43:52.718 align:start position:0%
to compensate
 
04:43:54.708 --> 04:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
the employee for
 
04:43:57.590 --> 04:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
the value of that
 
04:43:59.350 --> 04:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
unused vacation time
 
04:44:01.350 --> 04:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for your question uh so my
 
04:44:03.350 --> 04:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
testimony states that if there is not a
 
04:44:05.910 --> 04:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
policy written so if you have a policy
 
04:44:08.550 --> 04:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
that states that it is forfeited then it
 
04:44:10.310 --> 04:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
would be forfeited but if you do not
 
04:44:13.030 --> 04:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
have so in the absence of a policy
 
04:44:15.510 --> 04:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
current legislation states that the
 
04:44:17.830 --> 04:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
employee is entitled to the payout
 
04:44:18.868 --> 04:44:18.878 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:44:22.470 --> 04:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you uh yes thank you i
 
04:44:25.190 --> 04:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
that part i got i i was posing the
 
04:44:28.070 --> 04:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
question with the ambiguity that the
 
04:44:29.990 --> 04:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
policy just said what i said it said
 
04:44:30.000 --> 04:44:30.708 align:start position:0%
policy just said what i said it said
that

04:44:30.708 --> 04:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:44:30.718 --> 04:44:31.750 align:start position:0%
that
um

04:44:31.750 --> 04:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:33.990 --> 04:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
you're entitled to these
 
04:44:35.590 --> 04:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh five weeks
 
04:44:37.910 --> 04:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say what happens
 
04:44:37.920 --> 04:44:38.708 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say what happens
if

04:44:38.708 --> 04:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
the company if you get laid off it just
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the
 
04:44:43.200 --> 04:44:44.868 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the
um

04:44:44.868 --> 04:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:47.590 --> 04:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
the guidelines that say you you get
 
04:44:49.590 --> 04:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
credit for it or you lose it
 
04:44:52.070 --> 04:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
04:44:54.628 --> 04:44:54.638 align:start position:0%
in that instance would you agree with
 
04:44:57.270 --> 04:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
mr berkey and mr duvet that
 
04:44:59.430 --> 04:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
the employee is not entitled to any
 
04:45:02.470 --> 04:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
compensation of any type for that loss
 
04:45:04.230 --> 04:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
no i would not so currently my
 
04:45:06.310 --> 04:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
understanding of the legislation is in
 
04:45:08.230 --> 04:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
the absence of the policy that states
 
04:45:10.230 --> 04:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
what happens upon termination so a
 
04:45:11.910 --> 04:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
layoff an acquisition a merger they're
 
04:45:14.070 --> 04:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
all terminations the prior employer
 
04:45:16.708 --> 04:45:16.718 align:start position:0%
terminates the new employer hires
 
04:45:18.550 --> 04:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
so that termination if they did not have
 
04:45:20.948 --> 04:45:20.958 align:start position:0%
a policy that stated what happens upon
 
04:45:22.550 --> 04:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
termination whether voluntary or
 
04:45:24.390 --> 04:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
involuntary they would be entitled to be
 
04:45:30.708 --> 04:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:32.070 --> 04:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions thank you
 
04:45:33.190 --> 04:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
very much
 
04:45:36.150 --> 04:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
um i i like to look at body language and
 
04:45:37.990 --> 04:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
i see some body language from rudy ogden
 
04:45:39.910 --> 04:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
i'm going to call him up later and i
 
04:45:41.670 --> 04:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
think he has a few things to say so if
 
04:45:43.670 --> 04:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
you mind if i just let our last speaker
 
04:45:45.430 --> 04:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
then you can come back up rudy
 
04:45:47.030 --> 04:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
gary abbott
 
04:46:00.550 --> 04:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:02.708 --> 04:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
mr abbott thank you chairman committee
 
04:46:05.030 --> 04:46:05.040 align:start position:0%

04:46:12.628 --> 04:46:12.638 align:start position:0%
i almost want to listen to rudy's
 
04:46:14.270 --> 04:46:14.280 align:start position:0%

testimony before mine
[Music]

04:46:16.628 --> 04:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:46:19.190 --> 04:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
we're here in opposition i want to i
 
04:46:21.190 --> 04:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
think the speakers before me gave a
 
04:46:22.948 --> 04:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
pretty good uh
 
04:46:24.628 --> 04:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
discussion of the
 
04:46:26.788 --> 04:46:26.798 align:start position:0%
of the bill but every time i hear a bill
 
04:46:28.470 --> 04:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
of earned time i'm going to tell you
 
04:46:30.708 --> 04:46:30.718 align:start position:0%
what flags it for us
 
04:46:33.110 --> 04:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's the word earned
 
04:46:34.868 --> 04:46:34.878 align:start position:0%
and then in this bill which people
 
04:46:37.030 --> 04:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
really haven't talked about is line 12
 
04:46:39.590 --> 04:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
13 and 14.
 
04:46:41.910 --> 04:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
i really highlighted
 
04:46:46.070 --> 04:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
what constitutes wages do
 
04:46:48.550 --> 04:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
this puts in place something very unique
 
04:46:50.070 --> 04:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
in the statute
 
04:46:52.470 --> 04:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's for 15 employees or more or
 
04:46:55.750 --> 04:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
whatever it's constituting a benefit is
 
04:46:55.760 --> 04:46:56.948 align:start position:0%
whatever it's constituting a benefit is
wages

04:46:56.948 --> 04:46:56.958 align:start position:0%
wages
 
04:46:59.110 --> 04:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
and i agree with dave duvet who spoke
 
04:46:59.120 --> 04:47:00.470 align:start position:0%
and i agree with dave duvet who spoke
earlier

04:47:00.470 --> 04:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
04:47:03.670 --> 04:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
most companies started vacation sick pay
 
04:47:06.470 --> 04:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
for employees to take it while they work
 
04:47:08.628 --> 04:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
we want people to take time off so
 
04:47:10.628 --> 04:47:10.638 align:start position:0%
they're good employees over the whole
 
04:47:13.830 --> 04:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
course of working for a company
 
04:47:16.550 --> 04:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
this this earned part and i want to
 
04:47:18.788 --> 04:47:18.798 align:start position:0%
describe my understanding of the law i'm
 
04:47:20.390 --> 04:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
glad you're going to have rudy after me
 
04:47:22.628 --> 04:47:22.638 align:start position:0%
but my understanding of the law
 
04:47:25.270 --> 04:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
and most of the companies i represent i
 
04:47:27.910 --> 04:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
would almost guarantee they have
 
04:47:30.628 --> 04:47:30.638 align:start position:0%
company office policies that address
 
04:47:32.390 --> 04:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
these type of things
 
04:47:34.310 --> 04:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
what you would be compensated when you
 
04:47:38.470 --> 04:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
leave how your 401k program works all of
 
04:47:40.070 --> 04:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
these things
 
04:47:42.868 --> 04:47:42.878 align:start position:0%
are in company office policies
 
04:47:45.190 --> 04:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
i agree there may be some
 
04:47:47.990 --> 04:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
if a company closes some of the examples
 
04:47:49.430 --> 04:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
it might not be in there because
 
04:47:52.070 --> 04:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
companies base their office policies
 
04:47:53.670 --> 04:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
that they're in business this is how
 
04:47:55.910 --> 04:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to work whether you terminate
 
04:47:56.788 --> 04:47:56.798 align:start position:0%
or not
 
04:47:59.110 --> 04:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
but it's the word earned and it's it's
 
04:48:01.750 --> 04:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's been in all of these bills where
 
04:48:04.070 --> 04:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
you earn 10 hours a month or whatever
 
04:48:06.628 --> 04:48:06.638 align:start position:0%
you know that the word earned
 
04:48:08.788 --> 04:48:08.798 align:start position:0%
for me it's been a benchmark of how
 
04:48:12.070 --> 04:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
company allocates vacation time not
 
04:48:15.510 --> 04:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily it's earned as compensation
 
04:48:16.788 --> 04:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
and that's the
 
04:48:18.948 --> 04:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
the disconnect is that
 
04:48:21.270 --> 04:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
you could have a company that you get
 
04:48:24.868 --> 04:48:24.878 align:start position:0%
paid your vacation time if you meant if
 
04:48:27.670 --> 04:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
you meet other qualifications within
 
04:48:29.750 --> 04:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
your office policies
 
04:48:31.670 --> 04:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
like you leave us in good standings but
 
04:48:33.430 --> 04:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
good standings in the office policy
 
04:48:36.868 --> 04:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
could be you give us two weeks notice
 
04:48:38.390 --> 04:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
and if you don't give us two weeks
 
04:48:41.910 --> 04:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
notice you don't get that that amount
 
04:48:43.990 --> 04:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
companies vary their policies not all
 
04:48:45.910 --> 04:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
companies do that
 
04:48:49.350 --> 04:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
some companies have other regulations
 
04:48:51.510 --> 04:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
and other decisions based on their own
 
04:48:51.520 --> 04:48:53.270 align:start position:0%
and other decisions based on their own
company

04:48:53.270 --> 04:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
company
 
04:48:55.750 --> 04:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
there's no one size fits all and i think
 
04:48:58.708 --> 04:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
that becomes the problem but if you i
 
04:49:00.470 --> 04:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
also heard discussions on the first
 
04:49:02.310 --> 04:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
section the first section to me almost
 
04:49:04.948 --> 04:49:04.958 align:start position:0%
reads like current law
 
04:49:06.948 --> 04:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
an employer has to do his office
 
04:49:09.590 --> 04:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
policies gives it to the employee and if
 
04:49:12.150 --> 04:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
you break those regulations with your
 
04:49:12.160 --> 04:49:13.270 align:start position:0%
you break those regulations with your
employee

04:49:13.270 --> 04:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
employee
 
04:49:15.190 --> 04:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
rudy's coming after you
 
04:49:17.670 --> 04:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
that's what's going to happen that is
 
04:49:19.510 --> 04:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
you have it in writing you're giving it
 
04:49:22.150 --> 04:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
to the employee you have to meet that
 
04:49:24.868 --> 04:49:24.878 align:start position:0%
all the companies understand that so i'm
 
04:49:27.270 --> 04:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
looking at the top part that's really
 
04:49:29.350 --> 04:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
what a company does with their hr
 
04:49:32.150 --> 04:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
professionals and how the company works
 
04:49:34.230 --> 04:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
so i don't i understand why people are
 
04:49:35.670 --> 04:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
not having a big problem with that
 
04:49:37.190 --> 04:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
section because that's what ninety
 
04:49:40.948 --> 04:49:40.958 align:start position:0%
percent of the companies are doing
 
04:49:42.948 --> 04:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
but the the next part of constitute
 
04:49:45.110 --> 04:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
wages constitute wages what the
 
04:49:47.430 --> 04:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
department of labor will come in and do
 
04:49:49.190 --> 04:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
is if they have an employee that says
 
04:49:50.470 --> 04:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
hey i don't think i got paid the
 
04:49:52.708 --> 04:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
appropriate wages they'll come into the
 
04:49:54.150 --> 04:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
company and want to see those office
 
04:49:57.110 --> 04:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
policies are you living within your
 
04:49:59.430 --> 04:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
office policies that's really what
 
04:50:01.030 --> 04:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to look at
 
04:50:02.550 --> 04:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be the determining
 
04:50:02.560 --> 04:50:04.230 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be the determining
factor

04:50:04.230 --> 04:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
factor
 
04:50:05.910 --> 04:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
so we've worked with this system for
 
04:50:08.948 --> 04:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
years this is how it's worked
 
04:50:10.868 --> 04:50:10.878 align:start position:0%
prior to legislation
 
04:50:12.390 --> 04:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
and companies really know they've got to
 
04:50:14.390 --> 04:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
spell out how it works
 
04:50:17.270 --> 04:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
maybe you have this 10 hours per day but
 
04:50:19.270 --> 04:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
you're only eligible for two weeks if
 
04:50:21.510 --> 04:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
you leave you know there's all kinds of
 
04:50:23.590 --> 04:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
different it doesn't mean you earn it
 
04:50:25.510 --> 04:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
for a little 10 years you're going to be
 
04:50:27.910 --> 04:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
compensated for it because it as you
 
04:50:29.830 --> 04:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
heard in previous testimony the
 
04:50:32.628 --> 04:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
liability of the amount it is a
 
04:50:34.230 --> 04:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
liability fair or an accountant you
 
04:50:35.430 --> 04:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
would know at the end of the year for
 
04:50:38.470 --> 04:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
some of these companies it's a audited
 
04:50:42.550 --> 04:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
liability tax amount if a company policy
 
04:50:44.470 --> 04:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
does pay it out
 
04:50:46.470 --> 04:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
one of the scary parts of this bill is
 
04:50:48.310 --> 04:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
you may have a lot of companies now i'm
 
04:50:50.470 --> 04:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
confused at the bill
 
04:50:52.788 --> 04:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
if we write a policy
 
04:50:56.230 --> 04:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
but i read uh slide 17
 
04:50:56.240 --> 04:50:57.430 align:start position:0%
but i read uh slide 17
va

04:50:57.430 --> 04:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
va
 
04:51:00.150 --> 04:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
it says who leaves in good standings
 
04:51:01.830 --> 04:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
should there be additional language in
 
04:51:04.310 --> 04:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
good standings according to your company
 
04:51:06.470 --> 04:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
policy are we talking that
 
04:51:09.110 --> 04:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
or good standing that you work for me
 
04:51:11.830 --> 04:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
but it the policy doesn't come into
 
04:51:16.390 --> 04:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
effect i'm a little gray because policy
 
04:51:18.150 --> 04:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
what the company has and how that's
 
04:51:21.110 --> 04:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
interpreted what good standing is
 
04:51:23.030 --> 04:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
and that's where some of these other the
 
04:51:24.708 --> 04:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
company policy says
 
04:51:26.070 --> 04:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
you got to leave in good standing but
 
04:51:27.910 --> 04:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
you got to give us a proper notice so we
 
04:51:30.070 --> 04:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
can hire another person whatever that
 
04:51:31.430 --> 04:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
policy is
 
04:51:33.190 --> 04:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying everybody's company
 
04:51:35.030 --> 04:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
policy is like that but different
 
04:51:37.270 --> 04:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
companies are different some have used
 
04:51:39.030 --> 04:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
it or lose it
 
04:51:41.350 --> 04:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
the scary the scariest part is
 
04:51:42.948 --> 04:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
if you put this in
 
04:51:44.550 --> 04:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
what happens with all these companies
 
04:51:46.070 --> 04:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
and they just say
 
04:51:48.708 --> 04:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
there is no wages earned or compensated
 
04:51:52.150 --> 04:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
and this is where this line 13
 
04:51:54.470 --> 04:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
if you have a policy in which
 
04:51:56.868 --> 04:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
many companies don't pay out sick leave
 
04:52:00.390 --> 04:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
but some do some do but say you now
 
04:52:03.110 --> 04:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
adopt that as your vacation time
 
04:52:05.190 --> 04:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
period we give you four weeks a year but
 
04:52:06.550 --> 04:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
we decide
 
04:52:08.948 --> 04:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
in the policy you don't get paid for any
 
04:52:11.350 --> 04:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
vacation time i don't think you want to
 
04:52:13.110 --> 04:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
go in that direction i think companies
 
04:52:15.430 --> 04:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
still want to pay as a benefit
 
04:52:18.150 --> 04:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
but this sets up some very questionable
 
04:52:19.510 --> 04:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
things so
 
04:52:21.590 --> 04:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
we like the system that currently is in
 
04:52:23.430 --> 04:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
place now if you were going to draft a
 
04:52:25.030 --> 04:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
bill to address
 
04:52:28.310 --> 04:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
company buyouts i get it that's not
 
04:52:30.948 --> 04:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
normally in a company policy
 
04:52:32.948 --> 04:52:32.958 align:start position:0%
it's not in there may need to be
 
04:52:35.270 --> 04:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
language that makes it clear
 
04:52:37.110 --> 04:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
what happens at the labor department
 
04:52:38.390 --> 04:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
when they do that
 
04:52:40.470 --> 04:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
i think those kind of situations are
 
04:52:40.480 --> 04:52:41.750 align:start position:0%
i think those kind of situations are
unique

04:52:41.750 --> 04:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
unique
 
04:52:43.990 --> 04:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
but this bill addresses all companies
 
04:52:46.150 --> 04:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
that are 15 or more
 
04:52:48.230 --> 04:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
so those are our concerns which put us
 
04:52:49.590 --> 04:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
in place to
 
04:52:51.830 --> 04:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
at this time oppose the legislation
 
04:52:51.840 --> 04:52:52.628 align:start position:0%
at this time oppose the legislation
because

04:52:52.628 --> 04:52:52.638 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:52:54.390 --> 04:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
we think the system that currently is in
 
04:52:56.470 --> 04:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
place works
 
04:52:58.470 --> 04:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
i thank the uh committee for listening
 
04:53:02.230 --> 04:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:04.788 --> 04:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um just one
 
04:53:04.798 --> 04:53:08.070 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um just one
question

04:53:08.070 --> 04:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:09.670 --> 04:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
you lay one of your few of your
 
04:53:12.310 --> 04:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
companies lay off for the season
 
04:53:14.070 --> 04:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
would that be considered termination and
 
04:53:15.430 --> 04:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
would you be on the hook if you brought
 
04:53:17.110 --> 04:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
them back for all their vacation time up
 
04:53:19.350 --> 04:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
to that point or do you roll that over
 
04:53:20.948 --> 04:53:20.958 align:start position:0%
into when they come back because it is a
 
04:53:23.270 --> 04:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
seasonal job
 
04:53:26.070 --> 04:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
and i think that that varies a lot um
 
04:53:29.110 --> 04:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
because we have seasonal layoffs
 
04:53:31.190 --> 04:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
um i know some of the companies are very
 
04:53:32.868 --> 04:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
generous that even during the seasonal
 
04:53:34.470 --> 04:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
layoff they pay health insurance and
 
04:53:36.230 --> 04:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
they do some other things
 
04:53:36.240 --> 04:53:37.350 align:start position:0%
they do some other things
that

04:53:37.350 --> 04:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
because they're coming back
 
04:53:41.430 --> 04:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
they may have policies regarding within
 
04:53:42.788 --> 04:53:42.798 align:start position:0%
their own company
 
04:53:44.390 --> 04:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
how they handle
 
04:53:46.788 --> 04:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
vacation time and sick time
 
04:53:48.708 --> 04:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
and it may be choices but i don't know
 
04:53:50.708 --> 04:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
those situations but i'm sure they've
 
04:53:51.990 --> 04:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
worked it out
 
04:53:54.310 --> 04:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
what's best for keep retaining those
 
04:53:56.070 --> 04:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
employees so
 
04:53:58.310 --> 04:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
this bill you're absolutely right
 
04:53:59.990 --> 04:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
it could affect it because now if they
 
04:54:01.670 --> 04:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
have to pay out where they before were
 
04:54:01.680 --> 04:54:02.550 align:start position:0%
have to pay out where they before were
saying

04:54:02.550 --> 04:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
saying
 
04:54:04.390 --> 04:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
you know you can come back but i also
 
04:54:04.400 --> 04:54:05.350 align:start position:0%
you know you can come back but i also
think

04:54:05.350 --> 04:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:54:07.430 --> 04:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
unemployment office which is over my
 
04:54:09.830 --> 04:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
other shoulder
 
04:54:11.510 --> 04:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know they have very specific regs
 
04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
that how much money if they are paying
 
04:54:15.190 --> 04:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
out vacation before you start
 
04:54:16.948 --> 04:54:16.958 align:start position:0%
unemployment so there's
 
04:54:18.948 --> 04:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
there's other stipulations but i don't
 
04:54:20.868 --> 04:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
want to get into the two agency rules
 
04:54:23.430 --> 04:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
we've got two experts in the room here
 
04:54:25.430 --> 04:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
behind me and i would leave it to them
 
04:54:25.440 --> 04:54:26.708 align:start position:0%
behind me and i would leave it to them
but

04:54:26.708 --> 04:54:26.718 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:54:28.470 --> 04:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
this if you're trying to address certain
 
04:54:30.390 --> 04:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
specific issues maybe that would be the
 
04:54:36.070 --> 04:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:37.750 --> 04:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
so you know other hands thank you thank
 
04:54:37.760 --> 04:54:39.910 align:start position:0%
so you know other hands thank you thank
you

04:54:39.910 --> 04:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:54:41.590 --> 04:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
i'd like to call uh
 
04:54:47.430 --> 04:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:49.910 --> 04:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
the only reason i call you uh is i saw
 
04:54:51.590 --> 04:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
you shaking your head you disagreed with
 
04:54:53.910 --> 04:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
something that was uh being presented
 
04:54:55.990 --> 04:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
yes i wanted you to be able to so thank
 
04:54:58.070 --> 04:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
you chairman infantine and just for the
 
04:55:00.550 --> 04:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
record rudy ogden department of labor uh
 
04:55:02.310 --> 04:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
one of the members was asking me so the
 
04:55:04.470 --> 04:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
one point uh and i really might very
 
04:55:06.628 --> 04:55:06.638 align:start position:0%
much appreciate the uh testimony and
 
04:55:08.868 --> 04:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
perspective offered by those uh before
 
04:55:11.910 --> 04:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
me just in terms of existing legislation
 
04:55:13.750 --> 04:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
and how we would handle a situation in
 
04:55:18.230 --> 04:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
which there's not defined policy 275 43
 
04:55:21.750 --> 04:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
5 says that it's employment practice or
 
04:55:23.510 --> 04:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
policy or both
 
04:55:25.350 --> 04:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
so i just want to be clear that if we
 
04:55:27.430 --> 04:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
did not have a policy on the books and
 
04:55:29.510 --> 04:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
to how such time was handled by such
 
04:55:31.750 --> 04:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
time i mean earn time vacation time or
 
04:55:33.670 --> 04:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
such things as that we would be looking
 
04:55:35.510 --> 04:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
at what the employer's practice is so i
 
04:55:37.670 --> 04:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear that presently as
 
04:55:39.910 --> 04:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
as we're administering the law and i
 
04:55:41.510 --> 04:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
will speak with the testimony afterwards
 
04:55:42.708 --> 04:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering where that came from
 
04:55:44.070 --> 04:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
and hoping it's not coming from us i'm
 
04:55:45.590 --> 04:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
hoping a question didn't come to us and
 
04:55:47.670 --> 04:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
we answered it that way but existing law
 
04:55:49.030 --> 04:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
would be that we would look at then the
 
04:55:51.430 --> 04:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
employer's practice so again mindful of
 
04:55:52.550 --> 04:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
everyone's time but i just wanted to
 
04:55:58.868 --> 04:55:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:01.990 --> 04:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
you guys can talk about that offline
 
04:56:02.000 --> 04:56:03.910 align:start position:0%
you guys can talk about that offline
representative

04:56:03.910 --> 04:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:56:06.070 --> 04:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh mr chairman and
 
04:56:08.070 --> 04:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
since i have you back here i have kind
 
04:56:10.070 --> 04:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
of a legal question
 
04:56:12.470 --> 04:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
um the term layoff has been used a lot
 
04:56:15.190 --> 04:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
here and i remember many years ago an hr
 
04:56:15.200 --> 04:56:16.788 align:start position:0%
here and i remember many years ago an hr
representative

04:56:16.788 --> 04:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:56:19.510 --> 04:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
kind of telling us quit calling this a
 
04:56:22.390 --> 04:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
layoff it's a reduction in force and i'm
 
04:56:25.990 --> 04:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
wondering if a term like layoff has
 
04:56:29.510 --> 04:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:31.670 --> 04:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
04:56:34.070 --> 04:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
so my understanding different state
 
04:56:36.070 --> 04:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
entirely different circumstances but a
 
04:56:38.868 --> 04:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
layoff was when you suspended the
 
04:56:41.510 --> 04:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
position with the intent on bringing it
 
04:56:41.520 --> 04:56:43.750 align:start position:0%
position with the intent on bringing it
back

04:56:43.750 --> 04:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
back
 
04:56:46.390 --> 04:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't would new hampshire look at that
 
04:56:49.590 --> 04:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
term as legally loaded or
 
04:56:52.150 --> 04:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
can we use it in kind of the
 
04:56:53.510 --> 04:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
well i would say
 
04:56:54.470 --> 04:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:56:56.230 --> 04:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
representative for our purposes in
 
04:56:59.990 --> 04:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
administering rsa 275 or the other
 
04:57:01.990 --> 04:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
chapters under our title we would be
 
04:57:03.910 --> 04:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
looking at how it is addressed within
 
04:57:05.670 --> 04:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
that statute or that particular section
 
04:57:07.190 --> 04:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
if it's not addressed and it's just
 
04:57:09.270 --> 04:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
generally put out there as layoff we
 
04:57:10.868 --> 04:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
would then be looking at okay what's the
 
04:57:13.270 --> 04:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
generally understood term of that
 
04:57:15.590 --> 04:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
so there's not particular legal meaning
 
04:57:17.350 --> 04:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
in the sense that typically when we
 
04:57:18.868 --> 04:57:18.878 align:start position:0%
looked for particular legal meaning
 
04:57:20.948 --> 04:57:20.958 align:start position:0%
we're looking for that section how is it
 
04:57:23.270 --> 04:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
defined within that section or within
 
04:57:25.590 --> 04:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
that chapter or within that title so
 
04:57:27.270 --> 04:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
again we would kind of go from there in
 
04:57:28.948 --> 04:57:28.958 align:start position:0%
the absence of a specific definition
 
04:57:30.948 --> 04:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
there we'd be going to just how is that
 
04:57:38.470 --> 04:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:40.708 --> 04:57:40.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:57:41.910 --> 04:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
if it's not
 
04:57:43.830 --> 04:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
too complicated question how is it
 
04:57:46.070 --> 04:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
generally understood again for us it
 
04:57:48.470 --> 04:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
would be a layoff is in some ways looked
 
04:57:50.788 --> 04:57:50.798 align:start position:0%
at as a i i would want to think about it
 
04:57:53.430 --> 04:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit more but uh we see a layoff
 
04:57:55.830 --> 04:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
as different than termination for cause
 
04:57:58.070 --> 04:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
or termination for a specific reason
 
04:57:59.830 --> 04:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
layoffs are usually
 
04:58:01.430 --> 04:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
lack of work
 
04:58:04.310 --> 04:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
lack of financial resources to do it
 
04:58:05.830 --> 04:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
again i'd want to think about it a bit
 
04:58:06.868 --> 04:58:06.878 align:start position:0%
more but
 
04:58:08.628 --> 04:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
that's where i would start
 
04:58:11.430 --> 04:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you president
 
04:58:12.948 --> 04:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you deputy
 
04:58:12.958 --> 04:58:14.550 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you deputy
commissioner

04:58:14.550 --> 04:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
04:58:17.510 --> 04:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
lines 12 13 and 14
 
04:58:19.030 --> 04:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
are a sticking point
 
04:58:21.270 --> 04:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
for a few of the presenters and myself
 
04:58:23.830 --> 04:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
are we redefining compensation and wages
 
04:58:28.070 --> 04:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
due based upon a benefit
 
04:58:29.910 --> 04:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
you are in the sense that existing law
 
04:58:33.430 --> 04:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
would say they they are considered due
 
04:58:33.440 --> 04:58:34.868 align:start position:0%
would say they they are considered due
uh

04:58:34.868 --> 04:58:34.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:58:37.670 --> 04:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
based upon what policy or practice is so
 
04:58:39.990 --> 04:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
right now as speakers before me have
 
04:58:40.000 --> 04:58:40.868 align:start position:0%
right now as speakers before me have
said

04:58:40.868 --> 04:58:40.878 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:58:43.030 --> 04:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
compensation is being defined
 
04:58:46.310 --> 04:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
relative to this annual or earned time
 
04:58:49.270 --> 04:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
by when the employer says it's earned
 
04:58:50.868 --> 04:58:50.878 align:start position:0%
therefore it is wages this would be
 
04:58:52.708 --> 04:58:52.718 align:start position:0%
changing it to say
 
04:58:54.948 --> 04:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
specifically when it is
 
04:58:56.708 --> 04:58:56.718 align:start position:0%
accrued or
 
04:58:58.868 --> 04:58:58.878 align:start position:0%
bestowed in the sense of a front loading
 
04:59:01.910 --> 04:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
scenario that it it is by that point
 
04:59:09.030 --> 04:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:10.230 --> 04:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
you know questions thank you very much
 
04:59:11.590 --> 04:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
for coming up again is there anyone else
 
04:59:13.510 --> 04:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
who would like to speak on this bill
 
04:59:16.390 --> 04:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
i have no no one else scheduled
 
04:59:17.990 --> 04:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
all right being that i'm an hour behind
 
04:59:19.670 --> 04:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to close this hearing i
 
04:59:21.670 --> 04:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
have to unfortunately leave unexpectedly
 
04:59:23.590 --> 04:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
um vice chairman is going to take over
 
04:59:26.350 --> 04:59:26.360 align:start position:0%
the final bill um
 
04:59:26.360 --> 04:59:27.910 align:start position:0%
the final bill um
1569

04:59:27.910 --> 04:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
1569
 
04:59:29.590 --> 04:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
and just give me a second to get out of
 
04:59:29.600 --> 04:59:45.990 align:start position:0%
and just give me a second to get out of
here

04:59:45.990 --> 04:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:54.550 --> 04:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:09.670 --> 05:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:11.430 --> 05:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
all right it
 
05:00:13.830 --> 05:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
seems to have settled down so i will
 
05:00:17.230 --> 05:00:17.240 align:start position:0%
open up the hearing on hb
 
05:00:20.948 --> 05:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
1569 and ask the prime sponsor to
 
05:00:22.628 --> 05:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill
 
05:00:24.628 --> 05:00:24.638 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
05:00:27.270 --> 05:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
members of the labor committee um at the
 
05:00:29.350 --> 05:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
time of bill drafting i was seeing
 
05:00:31.030 --> 05:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
things happening in other parts of the
 
05:00:33.830 --> 05:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
country where workers were not laid off
 
05:00:35.350 --> 05:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
but were barred from entering their
 
05:00:37.990 --> 05:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
workplace so that they constructively
 
05:00:39.670 --> 05:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't were fired but couldn't get
 
05:00:41.910 --> 05:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
unemployment we never saw that happen
 
05:00:44.070 --> 05:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
here our laws already cover the
 
05:00:46.628 --> 05:00:46.638 align:start position:0%
situation in new hampshire so the first
 
05:00:48.310 --> 05:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
section of the bill in my view is
 
05:00:50.788 --> 05:00:50.798 align:start position:0%
unnecessary the second section came to
 
05:00:52.628 --> 05:00:52.638 align:start position:0%
my attention as a colonel in the
 
05:00:55.590 --> 05:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
reserves spoke to a lot of spoke to a
 
05:00:57.990 --> 05:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
lot of issues that he had and he had
 
05:01:01.030 --> 05:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
found with retention because of uh
 
05:01:04.948 --> 05:01:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:07.750 --> 05:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
the name of it the the drill pay
 
05:01:09.750 --> 05:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
but that actually is already in law that
 
05:01:11.350 --> 05:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
that's not wages
 
05:01:13.270 --> 05:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
so i seem to have brought a bill to you
 
05:01:16.230 --> 05:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
that is completely unnecessary so i
 
05:01:18.868 --> 05:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
would ask that uitl it
 
05:01:25.030 --> 05:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:26.628 --> 05:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
 
05:01:26.638 --> 05:01:30.070 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
representative

05:01:30.070 --> 05:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:33.750 --> 05:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:35.750 --> 05:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
probably shouldn't do this but
 
05:01:38.230 --> 05:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
um i i did get an email i believe
 
05:01:40.550 --> 05:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
yesterday um from
 
05:01:44.390 --> 05:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
a colonel in the um national guard who
 
05:01:46.230 --> 05:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
was asking us to address this issue on
 
05:01:49.190 --> 05:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
his behalf um is he now aware that this
 
05:01:51.270 --> 05:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
is in the statute and because it sounds
 
05:01:54.628 --> 05:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
like he actually was harmed by
 
05:01:57.190 --> 05:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
the situation is he now satisfied and
 
05:02:00.390 --> 05:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
going to get his back pay
 
05:02:01.830 --> 05:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
actually he is the one who brought it to
 
05:02:03.990 --> 05:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
my attention initially so thank you for
 
05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
that important question he actually told
 
05:02:09.270 --> 05:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
me that it was in law i assume somebody
 
05:02:11.510 --> 05:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
on this committee informed him of that
 
05:02:14.310 --> 05:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
and so once he was informed that it was
 
05:02:16.788 --> 05:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
covered he's now pivoting to making sure
 
05:02:18.390 --> 05:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
that everybody within the reserves is
 
05:02:21.270 --> 05:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
aware that those are not wages and that
 
05:02:23.670 --> 05:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
they do qualify for unemployment even if
 
05:02:26.390 --> 05:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
they are drilling once a month
 
05:02:27.430 --> 05:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:02:29.590 --> 05:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:02:32.150 --> 05:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
05:02:34.390 --> 05:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
05:02:37.430 --> 05:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
i also have a card from deputy
 
05:02:39.350 --> 05:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner lavers
 
05:02:39.360 --> 05:02:40.470 align:start position:0%
commissioner lavers
um

05:02:40.470 --> 05:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:42.550 --> 05:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
i think
 
05:02:44.628 --> 05:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
we've we've been given the suggestion
 
05:02:47.910 --> 05:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
that we simply itl if you can quickly
 
05:02:50.470 --> 05:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
shed some light on
 
05:02:52.230 --> 05:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
what's already in the law i think that
 
05:02:57.030 --> 05:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:59.830 --> 05:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
and turn on
 
05:03:01.590 --> 05:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
is that better
 
05:03:03.110 --> 05:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
for the record richard lavers deputy
 
05:03:04.550 --> 05:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner new hampshire department of
 
05:03:06.230 --> 05:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
employment security
 
05:03:07.590 --> 05:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
so the department doesn't have a
 
05:03:07.600 --> 05:03:08.628 align:start position:0%
so the department doesn't have a
position

05:03:08.628 --> 05:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
position
 
05:03:11.270 --> 05:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
on this bill uh the first component of
 
05:03:12.708 --> 05:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
the bill would would
 
05:03:16.230 --> 05:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh seek to define uh or broaden the
 
05:03:18.150 --> 05:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
what's considered as totally unemployed
 
05:03:20.310 --> 05:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
so someone that is unable to access
 
05:03:22.788 --> 05:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
their place of employment and the second
 
05:03:24.708 --> 05:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
component would
 
05:03:27.670 --> 05:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
exclude from what is considered wages
 
05:03:29.910 --> 05:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
when you're collecting unemployment and
 
05:03:32.070 --> 05:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
what needs to be deducted from your
 
05:03:34.390 --> 05:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit
 
05:03:41.030 --> 05:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:44.550 --> 05:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:47.270 --> 05:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
just to clarify that
 
05:03:48.948 --> 05:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
those types of
 
05:03:51.510 --> 05:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
wages if earned while you're collecting
 
05:03:53.830 --> 05:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
unemployment still need to be reported
 
05:03:55.350 --> 05:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
to the department
 
05:03:57.030 --> 05:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
we ask a series of questions on your
 
05:03:59.990 --> 05:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
weekly claim regarding any work or any
 
05:04:02.230 --> 05:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
earnings that you did have individuals
 
05:04:03.750 --> 05:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
still need to report that to the
 
05:04:06.230 --> 05:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
department it's not the individual who
 
05:04:09.190 --> 05:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
decides what gets reported and doesn't
 
05:04:11.030 --> 05:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
that needs to be reported the department
 
05:04:12.708 --> 05:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
determines whether or not is something
 
05:04:15.030 --> 05:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
that is excludable or is going to be
 
05:04:16.470 --> 05:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
applied against your unemployment
 
05:04:16.480 --> 05:04:18.550 align:start position:0%
applied against your unemployment
benefit

05:04:18.550 --> 05:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
05:04:19.990 --> 05:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
05:04:21.510 --> 05:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
are there questions for the commissioner
 
05:04:24.150 --> 05:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
i see representative avilani
 
05:04:25.830 --> 05:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman not to drag this
 
05:04:27.430 --> 05:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
out but um
 
05:04:28.948 --> 05:04:28.958 align:start position:0%
some of the drill stuff is that
 
05:04:34.070 --> 05:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:37.510 --> 05:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
um i would have to defer to um
 
05:04:39.670 --> 05:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
how it is actually paid to the national
 
05:04:39.680 --> 05:04:41.190 align:start position:0%

to be reported
 
05:04:54.470 --> 05:04:54.480 align:start position:0%

05:04:56.788 --> 05:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
pay as i understand it
 
05:04:59.590 --> 05:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
that is received based upon the
 
05:05:02.070 --> 05:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
type of mission on which someone is
 
05:05:04.708 --> 05:05:04.718 align:start position:0%

the men and women of the national guard

during the pandemic
 
05:05:16.070 --> 05:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
and they were a lifesaver to us for
 
05:05:17.910 --> 05:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
everything that they did but i believe
 
05:05:17.920 --> 05:05:19.430 align:start position:0%
everything that they did but i believe
that

05:05:19.430 --> 05:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:05:21.670 --> 05:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
that type of pay still needs to be
 
05:05:23.750 --> 05:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
reported to us if you are filing for
 
05:05:23.760 --> 05:05:25.990 align:start position:0%

05:06:13.430 --> 05:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh so i don't know if everyone here is
 
05:06:15.430 --> 05:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
aware we had originally
 
05:06:17.510 --> 05:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
planned to have an executive session
 
05:06:19.030 --> 05:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
05:06:21.590 --> 05:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh with the absence i know the chairman
 
05:06:23.510 --> 05:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
discussed it with some people we are not
 
05:06:26.310 --> 05:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
going to hold that executive session
 
05:06:29.830 --> 05:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
um as the chairman said he is trying to
 
05:06:33.590 --> 05:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
arrange the substitute days and that
 
05:06:36.070 --> 05:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
will have to be worked through
 
05:06:36.080 --> 05:06:37.110 align:start position:0%
will have to be worked through
um

05:06:37.110 --> 05:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:37.120 --> 05:06:38.070 align:start position:0%
um
the

05:06:38.070 --> 05:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:06:40.150 --> 05:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
availability of facilities
 
05:06:42.550 --> 05:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
right now he was talking about the
 
05:06:45.110 --> 05:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
second which is a wednesday
 
05:06:47.270 --> 05:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
um maybe trying to do
 
05:06:49.190 --> 05:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
some of our executive session then and
 
05:06:51.270 --> 05:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
then finishing on
 
05:06:53.750 --> 05:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
on the 10th of march
 
05:06:55.510 --> 05:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
which is a thursday
 
05:06:58.150 --> 05:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
and i think our final day to do any
 
05:07:00.070 --> 05:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
execs but
 
05:07:02.708 --> 05:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
that has to be scheduled so look for the
 
05:07:06.628 --> 05:07:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:08.708 --> 05:07:08.718 align:start position:0%
and if there
 
05:07:10.868 --> 05:07:10.878 align:start position:0%
looks like everybody's leaving so
 
05:07:13.110 --> 05:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
there are no other questions
 
05:10:04.948 --> 05:10:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:04.958 --> 05:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
