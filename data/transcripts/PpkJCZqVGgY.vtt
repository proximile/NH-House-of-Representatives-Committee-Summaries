00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
it seemed like spring
 
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
it was 40
 
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
degrees windy and then i got out of the
 
00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:49.190 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:59.429 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
by two different guys
 
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
it's a maze yeah no it's also i've got
 
00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
i got him on my right so i know where i
 
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
am i got you on my left and i think
 
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
where am i
 
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
yeah we didn't we didn't count right
 
00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
when we came down the table did we
 
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
no problem getting fresh air with that
 
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.869 align:start position:0%
no problem getting fresh air with that
wind

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
now who are we missing though
 
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
always late that was why i brought that
 
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
up to the day it's a real problem
 
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.589 align:start position:0%
up to the day it's a real problem
because

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 align:start position:0%
bang bang a lot of these are one vote
 
00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
but like lucy said he can't do anything
 
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
yeah basically the reason i called john
 
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
is i wanted to make sure i was accurate
 
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
with what i wrote for a committee report
 
00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to make sure what was going
 
00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 align:start position:0%
on with that then i had this
 
00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 align:start position:0%
conversation i said well this doesn't
 
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
make any sense then
 
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
so i kept digging into it and then as i
 
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
called him he said i'm not going to
 
00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
change my vote even if the other one
 
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
environment does that and i said okay
 
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
this is never going to go any further
 
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
but then when we got even more data it
 
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
became even more confusing so i thought
 
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
i'd bring you into the loop but i didn't
 
00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
call you last night because i didn't
 
00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 align:start position:0%
need to burden you if he wasn't going to
 
00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 align:start position:0%
change we weren't having the votes it
 
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
didn't matter so
 
00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 align:start position:0%
right so i was basically i was doing is
 
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
for my mobile office while driving and
 
00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 align:start position:0%
then after i got home and then trying to
 
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
write the report and making sure that
 
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying something that's not
 
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.390 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying something that's not
correct

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.190 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
even though it's really kind of a flaw
 
00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 align:start position:0%
in the law
 
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
even though you have a policy to take
 
00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
off here
 
00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 align:start position:0%
well what it means is they're not
 
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
enforced the hhs is not enforcing
 
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
because it says they must enforce that
 
00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 align:start position:0%
policy my ideas if my policy is i don't
 
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
this is the health and human services
 
00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
committee in exile
 
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
from our previous room and there was no
 
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
truth to the fact we were thrown out
 
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
um and there's no truth to the fact that
 
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
we caused damage which led to being
 
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
thrown out
 
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
simply finance wanted their room back
 
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
and we thought that was only fair
 
00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 align:start position:0%
thank you to those of you including a
 
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
few of you in the wee hours of the
 
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
morning who sent your reports to me
 
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
because i have to get them in by
 
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.270 align:start position:0%
because i have to get them in by
wednesday

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
wednesday
 
00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
at noon
 
00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
so i am going to
 
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
um ask that
 
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
if you move a bill
 
00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
or if you are the minority
 
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
report writer
 
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
you write that out
 
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
by hand unless you have a printer
 
00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
attached to your computer
 
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
and give it to me over the lunch hour or
 
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
before you leave which i hope will be
 
00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 align:start position:0%
mid afternoon at the latest
 
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 align:start position:0%

house bill 1290 establishing a task
 
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
force on precision medicine and
 
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 align:start position:0%

rogers for bringing this before the
committee

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
1290 is a bill which establishes a task
 
00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 align:start position:0%
force on precision medicine and
 
00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.990 align:start position:0%
force on precision medicine and
biomarker

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
biomarker
 
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
testing that includes genetic screening
 
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
i would like to point out to you ladies
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
and gentlemen that we have been
 
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.629 align:start position:0%
and gentlemen that we have been
presented

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
presented
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
with two dreams one of which has ended
 
00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 align:start position:0%
and that is the dream
 
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
that representative cushing would still
 
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
be serving in our house at this time
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
that dream has ended
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
we have also been presented with a dream
 
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
by representative rogers
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
who brings to us the possibility that we
 
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
can facilitate
 
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
a program of precision medicine that
 
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
will extend the lives of those suffering
 
00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 align:start position:0%
from a variety of diseases
 
00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
and perhaps save many of those
 
00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
many of those lives
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
it is our question of how we might best
 
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.230 align:start position:0%
it is our question of how we might best
implement

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
implement
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
such a dream
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
if we choose to use the tool
 
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
of the house
 
00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
that will be a slow process that bill
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
would have to come out of this committee
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
it would have to go to the floor it
 
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
would be late in the season to begin
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
work on such an important task
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
i will be making a motion to
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
put this bill into interim study and to
 
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
ask the chairman to remand it to
 
00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee for health and
 
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
human services
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
for expeditious action i would trust the
 
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
chairman of the oversight committee to
 
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
act before the end of this month
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
to appoint a task force
 
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
to deal with the issues that are raised
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
by a request for
 
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
attention to precision medicine the

to come up with a bipartisan amendment
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
that would make everybody happy
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
the longer of these two amendments is
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
the first version of what that committee
 
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
or that working group produced

00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%

00:17:52.799 --> 00:17:53.750 align:start position:0%
currently mandated in rules
it

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%

00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
takes one of them varicella and puts it
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
in statute permanently
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
the idea being that the the legislature
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
ought to be the body that determines
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
these things it ought not to be left to
 
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
administrative rules given the
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
um the gravity of the decision to
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
subsequent to coming up with this first
 
00:18:31.679 --> 00:18:32.710 align:start position:0%
subsequent to coming up with this first
version

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
version
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
i had a conversation with a number of
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
other colleagues who expressed some
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
serious concerns about a few things that
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
were in that version namely that it
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
moves varicella into statute
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
and if the premise is that
 
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
these decisions ought to be
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
given the full light of day through the
 
00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:55.039 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
we ought not to be adding it uh without
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
giving notice and without having that
 
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
debate in a publicly noticed hearing in
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
advance so the varicella really deserves
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
the same level of attention that the
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
other two do
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
the the other provision in the longer
 
00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:14.630 align:start position:0%
the the other provision in the longer
amendment

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
if if there were a situation in which a
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine needed to be mandate and there
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
were concern as to the
 
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
timeliness with which the legislature
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
could act
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
the longer version of this amendment
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
makes a provision for for a kind of
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
temporary mandate
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
and the temporary mandate would be for
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
20 months
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
and it would be
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
um the the dhhs commissioner would
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
establish that mandate but it would
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
require a three-fifths vote by the
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee the hhs
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
the idea of being there that there would
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
be some legislative involvement in that
 
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.310 align:start position:0%
be some legislative involvement in that
process

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
and being a supermajority of that
 
00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.510 align:start position:0%
and being a supermajority of that
committee

00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
that it would be a relatively high bar
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
to to meet
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
some concerns that i've heard since then
 
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
is that there isn't necessarily a public
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
hearing process for that
 
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
that it sets a precedent for that
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
committee performing a function that
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
it has not
 
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.549 align:start position:0%
it has not
ever

00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
ever
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
performed in the past
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
that it also may create some confusion
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
that the the
 
00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919 align:start position:0%
the shorter version of these two is is
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
succinct and and
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
relatively clearer
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
that the temporary mandate mandate may
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
not in fact be necessary because
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
um in fact we
 
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
we see relatively high
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
compliance voluntary compliance with
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
mandates and particularly if there were
 
00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.310 align:start position:0%
mandates and particularly if there were
that

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh urgent a need that a mandate would
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
not necessarily be
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
the way to go
 
00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.909 align:start position:0%
the way to go
so

00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
with that um you know i'll say that the
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
shorter version uh
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
quite simply says
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
what the original bill said which is
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
that rulemaking authority for the
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner with respect to childhood
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinations would be revoked but it
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
clarifies that in order to not have a
 
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
break with current practices
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
the the existing rules with respect to
 
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.310 align:start position:0%
the the existing rules with respect to
haemophilus

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
haemophilus
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
hepatitis b and varicella would remain
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
into effect in effect until they expire
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
in 2026 which would give the legislature
 
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
four years in which to
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
go through that
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
full and transparent process of
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
where did the date of june 30th 2026
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
come from for the
 
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.549 align:start position:0%
come from for the
um

00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
rules vaccines is that something that
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
came from
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
you does it exist presently no that
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
the the particular rules in question um
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
because they expire after 10 years the
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
starting date is in 2026 so in essence
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
we're saying that they would continue
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:17.190 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
and

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
would you believe that in fact
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee has had several
 
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
committees over the last
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
few years that have been very successful
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
and expedient moved very quickly
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
so that whoever was telling you that was
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
ill-informed it's been well established
 
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
point me to where additional
 
00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:56.230 align:start position:0%
point me to where additional
immunizations

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
immunizations
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
may be put
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
in place
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
who does it and show me where that is
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
listed um under the under the shorter
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
amendment it would the the
 
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
the ability to add additional
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
mandated vaccines for for children would
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
sit would rest with the legislative
 
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
process how do i know that
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
i trust you but
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
somebody says to me point it
 
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
well i i would assert that the fact that
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature has done it in the past
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
and that this section
 
00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.990 align:start position:0%
and that this section
specifically

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
mandates diphtheria mumps pertussis
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
polio rubella rubiola and tetanus is
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
is evidence of of the fact that
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
precedent exists the the legislature has
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
put those in the statute and established
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
those as mandated vaccines for for
 
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.549 align:start position:0%
those as mandated vaccines for for
children

00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
so this is one of those in the hierarchy
 
00:23:53.279 --> 00:23:54.710 align:start position:0%
so this is one of those in the hierarchy
of

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
who says who
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
it is precedent
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
it's not here anywhere
 
00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:02.830 align:start position:0%
it's not here anywhere
in

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
writing i'm trying to clarify what i
 
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
think i heard you say correct i mean i i
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
it's essentially saying i mean i i think
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
there is precedent here um in statute
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has in the past
 
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.630 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has in the past
created

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
created
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates for children
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
and so so that
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
that would not change
 
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.310 align:start position:0%
that would not change
okay

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair okay representative cushman
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i i think it's
 
00:24:32.799 --> 00:24:34.149 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i i think it's
just

00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
kind of um
 
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.029 align:start position:0%
kind of um
inherent

00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
inherent
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
that in law what's
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
the body that changes laws is the
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
legislature and that's
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's from the state constitution
 
00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.070 align:start position:0%
that's from the state constitution
okay

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
my preference is one over the other but
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
i don't have a pr
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
i can support either one of these the
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
difference really comes down to is
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
whether we want to provide
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
any kind of a
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
safety valve for the department of
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
health human services to be able to
 
00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:07.190 align:start position:0%
health human services to be able to
introduce

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
introduce
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
a vaccine through a statute but
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
recognizing the fact that the
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
legislative body doesn't move that fast
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
and sometimes maybe a need for it the
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
safety valve was for the department of
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
health human services to get the
 
00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
approval from the oversight committee
 
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
either one still protects
 
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
the current vaccines we have
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
three of them as representative cobalt
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
said are in rules it moves them now into
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
statute they remain there for two
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
legislative cycles which is four years
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
it gives us ample amount of time
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
to have a debate with the legislative
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
body about
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
what we want to do with those three
 
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.070 align:start position:0%
what we want to do with those three
vaccines

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
i prefer to have the ability for the
 
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
department health human services to
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
have the ability to have a safety valve
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
but i can live with the other amendment
 
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
that representative cole faults put
 
00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.230 align:start position:0%
that representative cole faults put
forward

00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
my concern
 
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.350 align:start position:0%
my concern
is

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:09.919 align:start position:0%
that we seem to be acting like we can't
 
00:26:09.919 --> 00:26:10.710 align:start position:0%
that we seem to be acting like we can't
give

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
give
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
a recommendation to the public for a new
 
00:26:14.159 --> 00:26:15.669 align:start position:0%
a recommendation to the public for a new
vaccine

00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
that to me is not implied in this bill
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
and this amendment
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
i don't think i think the issue here is
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
whether it's a mandate or not
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
whether the recommend whether the
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner can
 
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.549 align:start position:0%
commissioner can
mandate

00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
a new vaccine i don't think there's any
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
any problem that it's not at stake here
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
whether the commissioner can recommend
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
a new vaccine to deal with a new issue a
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
new disease
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
so to me it's a non-issue
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
whether the
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
whether the authority is given to the
 
00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:55.029 align:start position:0%
whether the authority is given to the
commissioner

00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
to me the commissioner can always
 
00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:57.990 align:start position:0%
to me the commissioner can always
recommend

00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
something to deal with a new situation
 
00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:27:06.909 --> 00:27:06.919 align:start position:0%
i think we saw a bill this year
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
1633 that spoke to mandating the coveted
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
vaccination after full fda approval so
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
if there's something coming down the
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
pipe that is in the regulatory process
 
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
the legislature will have time to
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
consider it and consider that process as
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
it is working through development and
 
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
working through both clinical and
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
real-world experience so i think that in
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
a novel disease state
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature would be well aware of
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
any disease in the development of a
 
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.470 align:start position:0%
any disease in the development of a
vaccine

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
i think the ones that we know about we
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
know about and
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
if there's an outbreak of something
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
there's the recommendations and we saw
 
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
greater compliance with recommendations
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
than mandates and so i i like this that
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
it gives those two sessions for those
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
three vaccines that are in rules
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
and just sort of walks quietly and
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
allows for those recommendations as
 
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative gay said and makes
 
00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
mandates come through the house and
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
senate and governor
 
00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative cofolt
 
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
i i also just want to reiterate that
 
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
voluntary uh voluntary vaccination rates
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
are are actually quite high um
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
the vaccination rate for
 
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.590 align:start position:0%
the vaccination rate for
um

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
for hpv for example is is around 70
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
as i understand it so
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily
 
00:28:31.279 --> 00:28:33.110 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily
um

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
a a vaccine mandate isn't necessarily
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
getting us from zero to a hundred or
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
zero to eighty or ninety um it is
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
quite likely the difference between 70
 
00:28:47.669 --> 00:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
and 80 or 70 and 90.
 
00:28:47.679 --> 00:28:49.909 align:start position:0%
and 80 or 70 and 90.
and

00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
so i i guess my my concern
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
about putting varicella into this in
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
particular because i have heard from a
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
number of people who have serious
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
concerns about that
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
is that i think we owe it the the
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
the whole principle of this bill the
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
whole reason it was brought forward is
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
because there ought to be
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
a full and transparent process through
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
the legislative process on these on
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
these decisions
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
that that ought to
 
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
that ought to rest with the legislature
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
and that we really owe it to the people
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
we represent to
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
to go through that process for them and
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
so that that's why you know i feel
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
fairly strongly that the the varicella
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
requirement in particular
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
um ought to uh to go back into
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
the same category as the other two which
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
is let's let's retain those through june
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
of 2026
 
00:29:42.559 --> 00:29:43.750 align:start position:0%
of 2026
and

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
someone can put forward a bill
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
between now and then
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
where and we can go through that process
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
the chair um has a question
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
given how long it takes for the
 
00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.710 align:start position:0%
given how long it takes for the
legislature

00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
to run through the hoops
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
my question is to representatives mckay
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
and weber
 
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
i'm relatively new as chairman of
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
oversight in your experience and
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge has oversight ever held a
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
public hearing prior to its doing
 
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
anything in your
 
00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.470 align:start position:0%
anything in your
remembrance

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
remembrance
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
i will state that i don't remember it
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
having done so but i know of no reason
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
why it couldn't we have in the course of
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
our meetings often particularly when
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
they are in person taken comment
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
when appropriate from other people
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
but i i think that we are possibly
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
making this
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
matter where we have a very small
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
distinction between two very similar
 
00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.149 align:start position:0%
distinction between two very similar
bills

00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
i i'm wondering if we're overthinking it
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
and if it would not be a good idea to
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
take a vote
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
i will be glad to be corrected by by
 
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative mckay whose
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
service on health and human services is
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
my memory is that
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
that certain issues were brought before
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee
 
00:31:22.799 --> 00:31:23.750 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee
and

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
it had been
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
thought through
 
00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:27.669 align:start position:0%
thought through
in

00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
either in committee or elsewhere
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
that the fastest way to get to this
 
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
particular issue
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
was to go to the oversight committee
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
it had to be
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
a member of the oversight committee
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
that had to take some responsibility for
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
starting that committee work
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
but that my memory is that that worked
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
extremely well
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
and in fact it was brought in
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
to deal with things like this
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
with a very knowledgeable
 
00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.789 align:start position:0%
with a very knowledgeable
membership

00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
membership
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
yes i think there have been
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
issues brought before the oversight
 
00:32:08.399 --> 00:32:09.430 align:start position:0%
issues brought before the oversight
committee

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
a committee was formed the committee
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
came back and reported to the oversight
 
00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.110 align:start position:0%
came back and reported to the oversight
committee

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
but the chair is correct i've been
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
around for
 
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
about 22 years i think so each
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
house member of oversight is a present
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
or former member
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
of at least
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
one term
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
in this committee
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
and senator rosenwald who is one of the
 
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
three senators is also a veteran of this
 
00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.549 align:start position:0%
three senators is also a veteran of this
committee

00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:42.559 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:32:42.559 --> 00:32:43.909 align:start position:0%
committee
so

00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee is not random it
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
is people who deal and have dealt with
 
00:32:49.519 --> 00:32:50.389 align:start position:0%
is people who deal and have dealt with
health

00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.110 align:start position:0%
and human services
issues

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
my concern is if
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
there is something that we cannot
 
00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.549 align:start position:0%
there is something that we cannot
foresee

00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
foresee
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
that would need legislative action not
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
that i want more work
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
but oversight committee is fast
 
00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.710 align:start position:0%
but oversight committee is fast
um

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
it meets all but the summer months it
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
will meet september october november
 
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
december this year
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
the legislature will not so if that is
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
naming oversight as opposed to
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
just assuming the legislative process uh
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
would be for your consideration
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative knurk
 
00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
i still have some concerns about the
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
either one of these amendments but the
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh amendment
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
943 more so tying the hands of our
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
public health experts in the event of
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
some need for a nimble response
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering since we're talking
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
all about something that affects them
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
could we perhaps ask them to weigh in on
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
the two amendments and see if they have
 
00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
anything important to say that might
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
guide our decision making
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
let's look out and see if we have
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
anybody from health and human services
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
here this morning
 
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking abby rogers would be a
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
and not only abby
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman pearson members of
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
the committee i'm abby rogers
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison for the division of
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
public health services and anna mccurry
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
just introduced yourself thank you for
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
allowing us to speak uh on this bill as
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
i can remind the committee the
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
department has significant concerns
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
about the underlying bill and testified
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
in opposition
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's ability to
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
require vaccinations uh is extremely
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
important to protect public health and
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
we we strive uh
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
to balance individual choice
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
taking that into consideration but but
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
this is to protect public health
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
and that's a consideration i know that
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
you're all aware of that but we are
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
concerned that these two amendments
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
would limit the ability to protect uh
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
individuals in case of an outbreak that
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
would need to be immunized quickly and
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
effectively to control the spread of
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
communicable disease i know there's been
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion in this committee
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
and in other committees in the
 
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
legislature about concerns around the
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
coven 19 vaccine specifically and we
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
have said multiple times that the
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
department has known no indication in
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
requiring that vaccine and this
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
committee yesterday i tell the bill that
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
would have required that so just that as
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
a reminder
 
00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:37.270 align:start position:0%
a reminder
we

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
work very closely with the health and
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
human services oversight committee and i
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
agree with everything that's been said
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
about that committee moving very quickly
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
i think that the concerns that we have
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
is certainly those that have been raised
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
here about the ability of the
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
legislature to meet quickly to determine
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
whether a requirement
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
should be put forward
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
we believe that the the rule making
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
authority as exists requires legislative
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
oversight through jail car to approve
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
vaccinations these recommendations are
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
made regulatory on the federal level
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
through asip
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
and we feel that um the process as is in
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
place now is sufficient to protect
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
public health we would be very concerned
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
about changing that we do understand
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
that there are concerns about additional
 
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
oversight and we hear those concerns um
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
the idea of either having a recommended
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine by the commissioner looked at
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
thoroughly by the health and human
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
oversight committee would be something
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
acceptable certainly
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
and also i know that the just to mention
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
that i know the committee yesterday
 
00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:39.510 align:start position:0%
that i know the committee yesterday
through

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
hb 1045 reconstituted the ethics
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
oversight committee which has a lot of
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in the area of vaccines
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
per hb 187 which this committee passed
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
last session so those would be
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
the comments that i would make on on
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
these amendments specifically and the
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
issue before you turn it over um
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
i wrote this down quickly i hope i wrote
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
it down accurately that while i trust
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
and have great respect for the current
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner i don't know if i met her
 
00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.630 align:start position:0%
commissioner i don't know if i met her
successor

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
successor
 
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.750 align:start position:0%
successor
so

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
that's a different thing
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
i believe you said
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
that you would like the ability for the
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner to move quickly to immunize
 
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
did you mean recommend immunization or
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
you all got to line up right now
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
oh no of course i'm sorry if i if i said
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
i was confused on that obviously the
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation for immunize of a
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
requirement uh not
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
certainly forced immediately very
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
important clarification thank you for
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
that thank you to
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
just to get us back to what the bill
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
does this is just talking about
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
children's immunizations for school it's
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
not talking about the response
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
to a pandemic is that correct
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
that is correct that is correct unless
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
the pandemic involves school children
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
and my next question if i may you may
 
00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.670 align:start position:0%
and my next question if i may you may
is

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
in the event that there was a pen
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
having just lived through a pandemic
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
more severe than anything i've seen in
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
my 69 years
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
would it be possible
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
in the event of a desperate emergency
 
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
and the right vaccine being miraculously
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
available in time
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
for the governor to issue an emergency
 
00:38:37.359 --> 00:38:38.870 align:start position:0%
for the governor to issue an emergency
order

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
and that's correct
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to argue to the committee i
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
don't know why we are splitting hairs
 
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
into four pieces over these two
 
00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.710 align:start position:0%
into four pieces over these two
amendments

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
i would certainly prefer
 
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.510 align:start position:0%
i would certainly prefer
the

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
first amendment myself
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
but if we pass the first amendment i can
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
promise you that there will be a debate
 
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
on the floor as to whether the
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
legislature ought to be
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
referring its power to a committee that
 
00:39:10.079 --> 00:39:11.510 align:start position:0%
referring its power to a committee that
is

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
very small
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
because we always have that debate when
 
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
we refer things to the fiscal committee
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
i also know we will also have a debate
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
on the floor about the varicella issue
 
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.829 align:start position:0%
on the floor about the varicella issue
so

00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying to people that
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
distinctions are relatively small
 
00:39:31.839 --> 00:39:35.829 align:start position:0%
distinctions are relatively small
and

00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
i'm talking myself almost all the way
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
around to an itl motion
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
myself to an itl vote myself
 
00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:46.550 align:start position:0%
myself to an itl vote myself
but

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:47.589 align:start position:0%
but
that's

00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
for debate and i'm sure we will debate
 
00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.630 align:start position:0%
for debate and i'm sure we will debate
it

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
um i i could live with either of these
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
two but i'm beginning to think that itl
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
is the better
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
is the better response
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
if i understand the representative who
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
just spoke
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
we are not bereft
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
in a case of an emergency should itl
 
00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.750 align:start position:0%
in a case of an emergency should itl
pass

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
we have the governor who can make
 
00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
a um
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
i'm blanking the term edict no that's
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
not it emergency order that'll do that's
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
much nicer thank you we also have uh we
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
we trust
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
the ethics advisory committee we also
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
have the dhhs oversight committee we're
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
not bereft
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
of input should this bill be itled we're
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
not out there empty
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
exactly thank you chairman pearson i
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
think both of those
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
those committees would be a great place
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
to seek guidance and advice on any
 
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
future recommendations from the
 
00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.790 align:start position:0%
future recommendations from the
commissioner

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
and i don't expect either of those
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
community committees ever to make a
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
mistake but in the unlikely event they
 
00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:53.990 align:start position:0%
mistake but in the unlikely event they
did

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
we can always have the legislature weigh
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
in because we
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
have the precedent for them to do so
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative knurk i would like to
 
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
move itl
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
on hb 1379 please
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the conversation that
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
representative weber just made i'm going
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
to ask you to hold on to that for a
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
want to move forward with her at this
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
moment okay i want to hear a few more
 
00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.710 align:start position:0%
moment okay i want to hear a few more
people

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
seems like we ought to have a chance to
 
00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.390 align:start position:0%
seems like we ought to have a chance to
move

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
move
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
we could do that and if it doesn't pass
 
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
we can move something else
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of moot yesterday if i
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
recall we took an itl before we heard an
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
amendment so that is there is a
 
00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative cofold i i would like to
 
00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.069 align:start position:0%
representative cofold i i would like to
move

00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
move
 
00:42:04.079 --> 00:42:05.430 align:start position:0%
move
amendment

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
ought to pass all right the chair will
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
accept that i think it's going to wind
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
up coming out the way
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
anyway i will accept that and the
 
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
amendment is 943h
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
correct and that is moved by cofault and
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
seconded by
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%

i do not see any hands for further

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
and they're coming
 
00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:15.109 align:start position:0%
and they're coming
around

00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
around

00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
understand that's why baton first isn't
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
always the best thing exactly
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
although that allows for a
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
reconsideration yes it does it can be it
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
can be but my daughter gave me a copy of
 
00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:44.060 align:start position:0%
can be but my daughter gave me a copy of
me

00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:44.070 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:49.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
and since i'm buying solo is drinking
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
bourbon when he's buying up her drink
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
and i just hold my nose and throw it
 
00:53:56.559 --> 00:54:09.109 align:start position:0%
and i just hold my nose and throw it
back

00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.119 --> 00:54:28.950 align:start position:0%
 
the hey

00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
all right we should have before us
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
amendments 952 unless the prime sponsor
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
is pulling it
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
i i'd like to first consider 10 12. we
 
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
will con but if we're
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
do we wish to consider 952 at all
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
because we would like to take a look at
 
00:54:48.799 --> 00:54:49.589 align:start position:0%
because we would like to take a look at
it

00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:54:49.599 --> 00:54:50.309 align:start position:0%
it
or

00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:54:50.319 --> 00:54:51.109 align:start position:0%
or
there's

00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
there's 953 which was the one we spoke
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
to yesterday
 
00:54:58.870 --> 00:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i am reading is that a two that's a
 
00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:00.150 align:start position:0%
yeah i am reading is that a two that's a
three

00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
oh my goodness i am reading the number
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
oh 9 52 it doesn't have written
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
yes 952 doesn't 952 just didn't have the
 
00:55:19.109 --> 00:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
word written that one was not supposed
 
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
to be distributed it was 9.53
 
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
all right i don't have that one and i am
 
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
apologizing to ols for all of my
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
multiple amendments
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
is there a stray copy of 953 anywhere
 
00:55:36.789 --> 00:55:36.799 align:start position:0%
may i have a straight copy
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
the only the only i don't want your copy
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
i just wonder if there's an extra one
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
the only difference is the word written
 
00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.349 align:start position:0%
the only difference is the word written
different

00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
three fifty three and fifty two the only
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
it will be a new thing for us but yes
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
it appears to me that there are two
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
previous leon amendments 952 and 953 and
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps if she were to state that she
 
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to offer either of them
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
we can then progress
 
00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:16.549 align:start position:0%
we can then progress
to

00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
the amendment that she actually does
 
00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
discuss well then i guess
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
at this time i don't want to offer
 
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
either of those right now i'm looking to
 
00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
offer 10 12. well let's take a look at
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
1012 shall we
 
00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
so um 1012 builds upon our
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
long and involved discussion yesterday
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
um on line 17 through 22 lines 17 and 18
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
add in back in the presence of visitors
 
00:56:47.829 --> 00:56:47.839 align:start position:0%
would be medically or therapeutically
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
contraindicated in the best clinical
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
judgment of healthcare professionals
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
given that this is in the licensing
 
00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:55.190 align:start position:0%
given that this is in the licensing
statutes

00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
because and because this is the area
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
that's the most likely to have some
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
contention and disagreement it states
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
that the reason for denial of a visitor
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
or medical for a medical or therapeutic
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
contraindication shall be documented in
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
the patient's medical record there's
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
already a lot of documentation that goes
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
on so if you're coding a patient they
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
they were coded and we asked the visitor
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
to leave should suffice if the patient
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
or their representative which may be
 
00:57:19.119 --> 00:57:20.069 align:start position:0%
or their representative which may be
their

00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
who they have through their power of
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
attorney or somebody else they designate
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
wants to know the reason they have
 
00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
access to that reason for denial
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
this simply protects both the patient
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
and patients rights to have their
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
visitor and it protects the hospital as
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
well because if they've documented that
 
00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.150 align:start position:0%
well because if they've documented that
joe

00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
joe
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
kept getting in the way when they were
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
trying to put in the central line that
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
is a great reason to kick joe out of the
 
00:57:44.319 --> 00:57:45.349 align:start position:0%
is a great reason to kick joe out of the
room

00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
and that if they ever try and argue that
 
00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:49.349 align:start position:0%
and that if they ever try and argue that
that

00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
um the presence of yes it says
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
number one the reason for deniable
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
visitor or medical therapeutic
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
contraindication should be documented in
 
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
the patient's medical record whenever
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
there's one of these clear things
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
especially with dictating into into the
 
00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:04.710 align:start position:0%
especially with dictating into into the
voice

00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
voice
 
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
medical records it seemed to be the
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
least burdensome way to protect
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
everybody's rights so this this does
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
keep it in licensing statute but that
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
provides more clarity around what might
 
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:25.839 align:start position:0%
thank you and i appreciate that
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
moved half the remaining distance to the
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
goal line but i don't think we're there
 
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
with this amendment first of all
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
it continues
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
the presence of all of this language in
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
the licensing statute which i opposed
 
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
i i get the point about documentation
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
but we are talking about what happens
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
when somebody's already in the grip of a
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic and hospitals are at the ends
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
of their
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh ropes in terms of staff and resources
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
and this is making things even more
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
difficult for them
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:14.319 --> 00:59:16.150 align:start position:0%
 
because

00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:17.030 align:start position:0%
because
the

00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh we're putting a line into the
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights which
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
incorporates a right by reference that
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
nobody knows how to look up in a time of
 
00:59:25.599 --> 00:59:26.630 align:start position:0%
nobody knows how to look up in a time of
stress

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
stress
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
and we're also making the patient's bill
 
00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
of rights which started out as a very
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
simple document
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
a much more complicated and legalistic
 
00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
one and and i don't think that's a great
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
my

00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
preference would be to itl this bill
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
entirely but i can live with the weber
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
amendment which is 0.946h
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
speaking only for myself i cannot
 
00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.910 align:start position:0%
speaking only for myself i cannot
support

00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
the new any of the layout amendments but
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
this one's better than the last but i
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
can't support it thank you
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
representative leon um thank you mr
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
weber for that i think that when we're
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
defining these rights either we're
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
looking to add 50
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
50 something new lines to the patient
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
bill of rights with your offering or one
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
that that references in mine
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
neither of them are simple or elegant
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
solutions but we found that visitation
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
has been a problem and
 
01:00:31.109 --> 01:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
it's not only a pandemic issue there
 
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
also may be issues in the future so this
 
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
is not related just to a pandemic
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your insight i i
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
believe that the licensing is the
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
correct place because um there aren't
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
there's there's not really any
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
repercussions for denying this access
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
to patients and we've been told that
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's not happening
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
if patients are not being denied
 
01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.630 align:start position:0%
if patients are not being denied
visitors

01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
visitors
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
then it's not a risk for the licenses of
 
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
these facilities um so that's why i
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
believe it's the right place to be thank
 
01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.990 align:start position:0%
believe it's the right place to be thank
you

01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
representative kanark uh mine's just a
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
simple question i think it's simple on
 
01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
your original amendment um oops now i
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
just grabbed the wrong one oh wait a
 
01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.270 align:start position:0%
just grabbed the wrong one oh wait a
minute

01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
minute
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
we were asked to make it simple so we'll
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
try on the original here we are
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
when the original amendment didn't we
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
still have in the phrase that was
 
01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.710 align:start position:0%
still have in the phrase that was
present

01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
present
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
below what is now on line 17 number a
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
the the line was there the presence of
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
visitors would interfere with the right
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
with the care of or rights of any
 
01:01:37.359 --> 01:01:38.630 align:start position:0%
with the care of or rights of any
patient

01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
patient
 
01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.990 align:start position:0%
patient
um

01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
here it was it was on your original one
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
online would you give the number to that
 
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
sorry the original one nine five three
 
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
fifty three seventeen
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
the presence of visitors would interfere
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
with the rights or care rights of any
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
patient that is now absent on the new
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
one and i was curious why that was left
 
01:01:57.119 --> 01:01:57.829 align:start position:0%
one and i was curious why that was left
out

01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:01:57.839 --> 01:01:58.710 align:start position:0%

and editing it because they came in
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
eight minutes before we started this
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
executive session right um if we can

and the first in your first amendment
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
which would now become yes probably b
 
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
and and and in the original bill it was
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%

referring just to your previous
amendment

01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
amendment

01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
yeah it needs to come after
 
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.910 align:start position:0%
yeah it needs to come after
representative

01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
if the patient is incapacitated but not
 
01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
the representation yeah i mean we don't
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
like incapacitated representatives
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
we can make some suggestions we're
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
outside of the um exec session but we
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
can make some suggestions to the
 
01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.309 align:start position:0%
can make some suggestions to the
representative

01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh who is going to uh wordsmith
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
this and
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
watch it waft to the fourth floor or
 
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
and because i tend to forget these
 
01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.710 align:start position:0%
and because i tend to forget these
things

01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
the sign ups for the original bill
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
and representative shapiro i think is
 
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
the one who usually likes to know this
 
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
is 109 signed in for
 
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
four people signed in against so there
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
now what do we have here
 
01:04:45.839 --> 01:04:49.829 align:start position:0%
now what do we have here
oh

01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:49.839 --> 01:04:56.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
chairman opens the exec session on house
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
bill 1035
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
relative to exemptions from school
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates and we have got a
 
01:05:10.799 --> 01:05:12.470 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates and we have got a
plethora

01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
plethora
 
01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:14.150 align:start position:0%
plethora
of

01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
amendments or at least we had
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
i have one that's been
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
given to me dated
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh february 25th the amendment is 8 54.
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't have it because i have a
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
big stack of them and you're about to
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%

going to introduce it to us
 
01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
this bill this is sorry this amendment
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
just seeks to remove the requirement for
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
notarization for the
 
01:07:55.589 --> 01:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
religious belief exemption for school
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
i don't know about you but i constantly
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
hear on my town facebook pages how do i
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
get a notary how do i get a notary my
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
bank isn't in town where do i go
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
um it
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
for things where you're removing
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
yourself from a registry i understand
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
the need for a notarization but in order
 
01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:13.910 align:start position:0%
the need for a notarization but in order
to

01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
share that you have deeply held
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs that the notary does
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
not inquire about it seems to be too
 
01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
much of a burden for our parents who are
 
01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
trying to get their kids to school to
 
01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
after school activities making sure
 
01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
their lunch is packed making sure they
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
have their jackets that
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
this requirement for a notarization
 
01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
just adds one more step yeah i'm okay
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
with that okay so i'm hopeful that we
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
can all support this
 
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
and um this becomes the bill this
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
01:08:55.349 --> 01:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
well just state that your town or city
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
clerk is always a notary which is a
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
great place to go
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
but i also agree
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
this is not a
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
situation in which we are worried about
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
somebody impersonating somebody else
 
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
and the schools would be in a good
 
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
position to figure it out if they were
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
so i don't have any objection
 
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
to removing the notarization line
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative canark i generally feel
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
the same as represented weber but i'd
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
actually like to appeal to her knowledge
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
base what about if they have an issue of
 
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
custody issues and one parent and the
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
other parent disagree is there would
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
this help at all or not representative
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
weber a notary is not going to have
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge of that and the schools are
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
likely to have knowledge of that and
 
01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
they are likely to have
 
01:09:42.309 --> 01:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
fierce policies on how to deal with
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
those situations because they've been
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
dealing with them for a very long time
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
and in in those cases maybe somebody's
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
going to wind up in court if you have
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
parents battling over these things but
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
that is well beyond the scope of this
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
and the schools are set up to deal in
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
one way or another with
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
parents who disagree and
 
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
i'll make a motion to pass the amendment
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
okie dokie and that is representative
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
merchant as seconded by a republican you
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%

01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
any further discussion i mean i haven't
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
i haven't looked at your
 
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
government-issued republican member form
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%

01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%

01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
i was sparing others of who are writing
 
01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
many reports today from having to do
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
another one
 
01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
all right now what do we got now what do
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
i think we still have 14.95
 
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
yes we do we do
 
01:14:22.159 --> 01:14:24.070 align:start position:0%

okay
 
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
this closes the exact session on 10
 
01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:29.270 align:start position:0%
this closes the exact session on 10
35

01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
35
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
and now
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
the chair opens the exact session on
 
01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:37.430 align:start position:0%
the chair opens the exact session on
1495.

01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
relative to vaccine mandates for
 
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
government contractors there is a
 
01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
and this is we have one but you would
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
like the new one yes i would like us to
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
i would like us to consider 10 13.
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
okay so nine five nine five two goes
 
01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:59.030 align:start position:0%
okay so nine five nine five two goes
away

01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
is that your wish you're not presenting
 
01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:05.920 align:start position:0%

01:15:07.199 --> 01:15:18.950 align:start position:0%
presented
good

01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
ever think of having a career as a
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
professional amendment writer
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
no because then i'd have to proofread
 
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:47.590 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative leon would you introduce
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
your amendment 1013 please
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um taking into
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
account um the great conversation we had
 
01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.630 align:start position:0%
account um the great conversation we had
yesterday

01:16:58.630 --> 01:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
i have added language so that the state
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
agencies whose job it is to certify
 
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
medical facilities or providers for
 
01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
medicare or medicaid are allowed to do
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
that certification
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
this simply allows them to do the job
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
which we have allowed them to take on
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
for the federal government so that it
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
does not jeopardize the reimbursement
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
for medicare or medicaid
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
otherwise it leaves the prohibitions on
 
01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:26.149 align:start position:0%
otherwise it leaves the prohibitions on
requirements

01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
in place
 
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
i thank the representative for adding
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
that in which i think is a great step
 
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
forward um i i will therefore vote for
 
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment but for all the reasons we
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
discussed yesterday i'm going to vote
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
against the ought to passes amendment
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
but i really appreciate the work that's
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
been done
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
to at a minimum assist the hospitals and
 
01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
the counties and the nursing homes
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
so you're in favor of the amendment
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
but the amendment becomes the bill
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
i am in favor of the amendment because i
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
think it's better than anything i've
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
seen so far i appreciate your clarity
 
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
against the underlying bill and i am
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
against the underlying bill as amended
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
because i don't think
 
01:18:19.679 --> 01:18:20.790 align:start position:0%
because i don't think
that

01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
we fully know
 
01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
what the ramifications might be for
 
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
other industries which we on the health
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
and human services committee are less
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:35.510 align:start position:0%
 
my

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
i i will be voting no on or not to pass
 
01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
as amended but i think the amendment
 
01:18:40.159 --> 01:18:41.350 align:start position:0%
as amended but i think the amendment
certainly

01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
goes a long way to solving at least
 
01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
some of the issues involved in the bill
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your clarification anyone
 
01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:51.110 align:start position:0%
thank you for your clarification anyone
else

01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
you're on your own today there you go
 
01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:02.709 align:start position:0%
you're on your own today there you go
[Laughter]

01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:19:02.719 --> 01:19:03.910 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
anyway

01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
i assume that this also does not prevent
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
any business or contractor from deciding
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
to require this on their own it's just
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
that they can't be required to do it is
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
that correct there's nothing about this
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
wording that says they can't do it
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
that's correct this is not this just
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
means that they can't require the
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
businesses to do it
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
it says nothing about what the
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
businesses are or are not able to do
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
this prevents us from being boston in
 
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative merchant
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
i also like represented weber have a
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
concern about the narrowness of
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
this being applicable to health care
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
facilities i think there may be other
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
additional agencies that have to comply
 
01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
with both federal and
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
law or regulations that
 
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
could be
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
pulled into it
 
01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
so i want to say thank you to the
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative for making the change i
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
think it's a step in the right direction
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
i just don't think it's far enough i'd
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
rather see it exempting state agencies
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
from all federal as well law or
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
regulations so we're not just talking
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
about health care
 
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
facilities representative folsom
 
01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
um if we
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh pass this amendment and then the bill
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
is there not a chance in the senate for
 
01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.189 align:start position:0%
is there not a chance in the senate for
them

01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
to add any
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
amendments of other industries that
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
people might think of by then
 
01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
there absolutely is but
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
without wanting to cast any aspersions
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
at our friends on
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
the other side of the wall or in the
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
other building or downstairs wherever
 
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
they may be located
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
their process
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
of necessity because there are so few of
 
01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:58.229 align:start position:0%
of necessity because there are so few of
them

01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
is a much more abbreviated
 
01:21:03.189 --> 01:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
process than is ours so
 
01:21:03.199 --> 01:21:04.470 align:start position:0%
process than is ours so
um

01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
unless people in those industries are
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
particularly vigilant
 
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
there i have a concern that that would
 
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
get taken care of um
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
and and again i i am this is speculation
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
on my part because i don't have the
 
01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
expertise to know myself thank you
 
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
we would not wish
 
01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
an omnibus bill with 700 parts coming
 
01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:28.639 align:start position:0%
our way
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
 
01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative gay
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh is there any way we could generalize
 
01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
and say federal requirements
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
that would cover those areas but that
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
opens the door much broader than this is
 
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
trying to do this is trying to say that
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
the state won't require businesses to do
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
these things if they're required by the
 
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
federal government to do that
 
01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:03.830 align:start position:0%
federal government to do that
we

01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:22:05.350 --> 01:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
that's a relationship between the
 
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
federal government and the business
 
01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
the question here is what other state
 
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
regulatory agencies are charged by the
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
federal government and accepted by this
 
01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
state to be the enforcement arm of the
 
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
federal government can we say it that
 
01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:20.870 align:start position:0%
federal government can we say it that
way

01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
so instead of specifying
 
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
which agencies we would be affected by
 
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
is there any way to make it more general
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
term so we don't have to worry about
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
some other
 
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
entity coming up and saying but but in
 
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
order to pass we have to
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
do it too this bill narrows but it
 
01:22:40.229 --> 01:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't exclude in other words it's not
 
01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
mentioning one way or the other anyone
 
01:22:44.229 --> 01:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
else it's mentioning these people these
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
these groups which came out of our
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
hearing another bill at another time
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps could expand the focus but we've
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
got a tight bill on specific things here
 
01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
with the amendment as as the presenter
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
attempts to do
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
i'd like to keep this clean we're
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
seeing uh no further um discussion or
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%

five-minute biological break

137 is we said it's okay to exempt these
 
01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:27.910 align:start position:0%
137 is we said it's okay to exempt these
groups

01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
groups
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
from that portion of the statute
 
01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
but just before that we passed one zero
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
four four by a fourteen to seven vote in
 
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
which we said that was not okay
 
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
so it was not affecting nursing homes
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
130 part two section two of one three
 
01:43:46.629 --> 01:43:46.639 align:start position:0%
four seven essentially does exactly what
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
one zero four four was doing
 
01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:51.030 align:start position:0%
one zero four four was doing
uh

01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:43:52.229 --> 01:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
representative cushman is shaking her
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
head no but i i
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
the reason i didn't bring it up first
 
01:43:56.790 --> 01:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
thing this morning i was
 
01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
i went bonkers last night i even called
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
john williams at night i then i
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
worked with him this morning and we've
 
01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
tried to figure out what's going on and
 
01:44:05.669 --> 01:44:05.679 align:start position:0%
i think unfortunately
 
01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
is your is the error we allegedly have
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
made and uh
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
that we just disagree politically or did
 
01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
we do something that we didn't invest
 
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
well first of all i think we all thought
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
we were voting on whether or not nursing
 
01:44:24.149 --> 01:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
homes could be exempted i'm seeing some
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
nodding heads i know that's what i
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
thought i was voting on this is the
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
hazard we always have when amendments do
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
come in just before is that we read and
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
we go through them but we can make
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
errors and so since it has to do with
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
the same substance of 104 which we
 
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
defeated 14 to 7 it does not make a lot
 
01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
of sense that we passed this
 
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
and so i wanted to bring it up we
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
if we have we can still disagree we
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
should at least make decisions based
 
01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
upon a knowledge of the bill that is
 
01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
accurate and that's my concern i don't
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
think we did chair's going to recognize
 
01:44:58.950 --> 01:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
representative cushman and then we may
 
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
bring forth um the uh
 
01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:03.990 align:start position:0%
bring forth um the uh
lobbyist

01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
lobbyist
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
procedurally you may
 
01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:07.990 align:start position:0%
procedurally you may
you

01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
01:45:12.629 --> 01:45:12.639 align:start position:0%
you may thank you
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i so
 
01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:16.390 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i so
if

01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding is what we can do at
 
01:45:21.910 --> 01:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
this point is a member who has voted in
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
are we
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
set a member who is in the majority may
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
move reconsideration and then everybody
 
01:45:36.629 --> 01:45:36.639 align:start position:0%
votes on whether or not we wish to
 
01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
reconsider our vote and if we wish to
 
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
reconsider our vote we then proceed to
 
01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:42.470 align:start position:0%
reconsider our vote we then proceed to
the

01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
main event but i think it would be very
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
helpful in deciding whether we want to
 
01:45:47.199 --> 01:45:48.870 align:start position:0%
helpful in deciding whether we want to
reconsider

01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
reconsider
 
01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
to hear from the folks who might have
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
some clarity to give us thank you
 
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cushman
 
01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um thank you
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
representative kanark there is an error
 
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
you're right in that um
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
in line 21
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
um really to make it do what we want it
 
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
to do we would just have ols draft an
 
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
amendment um that strikes the parent
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
parenthetical a and d
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
because under
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
151 colon two
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
section paragraph or section roman
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
numeral one
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's where it houses
 
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
resident under e residential care
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
facilities whether or not they're
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
private homes other structures built or
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
adapted for purposes for providing
 
01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
residential care which may or not
 
01:46:37.590 --> 01:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
be for elderly suffering from illness
 
01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
injury deformity infirmity or other
 
01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
permanent or temporary physical or
 
01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
mental disabilities so those are
 
01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.189 align:start position:0%
mental disabilities so those are
um

01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:47.590 --> 01:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
that would include nursing homes
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
so it would really be all of these
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
facilities under 151 colon two rehabs
 
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
are under there too just in a different
 
01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:56.149 align:start position:0%
are under there too just in a different
letter

01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
letter
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
and and then but the clarifying language
 
01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
of exactly who it applies to is in
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
on the ba on the page two of the
 
01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:05.830 align:start position:0%
on the ba on the page two of the
amendment

01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:07.030 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
in roman numeral 2 on line 3.
 
01:47:13.109 --> 01:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
so it's saying that those exceptions are
 
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
only for
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
nursing home skilled nursing facilities
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
intermediate care facilities or rehab
 
01:47:18.239 --> 01:47:19.910 align:start position:0%
intermediate care facilities or rehab
facilities

01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:47:22.149 --> 01:47:22.159 align:start position:0%
that that's where it's clarifies that
 
01:47:26.229 --> 01:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
it's not for hospitals and other um
 
01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
kind of facilities
 
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
so but you're right that those two
 
01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:31.109 align:start position:0%
so but you're right that those two
letters

01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
letters
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
that is an error
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
so um i would request that we can recess
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
this so i can run over and get a
 
01:47:40.229 --> 01:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
amendment um give that a minute i'd like
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
to call on um
 
01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:42.950 align:start position:0%
to call on um
loose

01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
loose
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
actually well they're coming up can i
 
01:47:55.590 --> 01:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
just respond to that comment that was
 
01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
made though you may okay um yes i agree
 
01:48:00.470 --> 01:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
that it does say that those two will not
 
01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:02.830 align:start position:0%
that it does say that those two will not
apply

01:48:02.830 --> 01:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
apply
 
01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:04.790 align:start position:0%
apply
um

01:48:04.790 --> 01:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:07.109 --> 01:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
but i think you were saying just strike
 
01:48:09.430 --> 01:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
the a and the d
 
01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:10.550 align:start position:0%
the a and the d
i

01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
i i otherwise even if
 
01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
if you say under on under 1 151 colon 2
 
01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
roman 1 that still includes all these
 
01:48:21.510 --> 01:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
other places um
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
and you've still exempted them
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:48:26.950 --> 01:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
so i think it's still a problem but
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
there's there's a secondary problem
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
which i think we want to hear from the
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
people who are not in the room when we
 
01:48:34.229 --> 01:48:34.239 align:start position:0%

01:48:34.239 --> 01:48:35.350 align:start position:0%

the new hampshire association of
 
01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:11.910 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire association of
counties

01:49:11.910 --> 01:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
counties
 
01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:12.790 align:start position:0%
counties
and

01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:15.589 --> 01:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
i can understand the the confusion
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
around this because um these sections
 
01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
are specifically romans 6 a
 
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
which begins on line 10
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
and and what i'm going to talk about and
 
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
kate and i are going to talk about is
 
01:49:31.990 --> 01:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
really lines 8 through
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
17 and then
 
01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
um the the final part of the
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
of the um
 
01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
you are speaking to the amendment
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
when you are citing lies okay uh yes
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you 0996
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:50.229 --> 01:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:49:53.589 --> 01:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
so this is something that um some of you
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
may remember from your days those of you
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
that have been on
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
had the chance to vote as members of
 
01:50:02.229 --> 01:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
your delegations
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
on the just a reminder that we are on
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
the clock so please suggest the change
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
and the reason for it with brevity and
 
01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:09.510 align:start position:0%
and the reason for it with brevity and
then

01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
representative cushman will respond but
 
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
we've got to pick up the pace this is
 
01:50:15.669 --> 01:50:15.679 align:start position:0%
this deals with the nursing home bed
 
01:50:15.679 --> 01:50:17.750 align:start position:0%
this deals with the nursing home bed
moratorium

01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
moratorium
 
01:50:21.589 --> 01:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
which has been in the statutes for many
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
years and
 
01:50:27.189 --> 01:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
for a number of years was was taken up
 
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
sort of as part of each budget
 
01:50:33.990 --> 01:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
and then a few years ago it was made
 
01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
just a permanent part of the statute and
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
it really is an essential part of the
 
01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
way that the nursing home funding is set
 
01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:43.510 align:start position:0%
way that the nursing home funding is set
up

01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:50:46.629 --> 01:50:46.639 align:start position:0%
both in terms of from the perspective of
 
01:50:50.070 --> 01:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
the individual nursing homes but also in
 
01:50:53.510 --> 01:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
terms of the state medicaid budget and
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
the county property taxes because as all
 
01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
of you know
 
01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
um the while the state
 
01:51:02.550 --> 01:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
has you know
 
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
the state's name is on the check for
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
nursing home funding it's largely the
 
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
counties that pay for that through their
 
01:51:13.270 --> 01:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
i would
 
01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:18.629 align:start position:0%
i would
suggest

01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
01:51:21.270 --> 01:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
removing the references
 
01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:22.310 align:start position:0%
removing the references
um

01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:23.430 align:start position:0%
um
to

01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:24.550 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
i would take
 
01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
point of order
 
01:51:29.189 --> 01:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
are we not discussing
 
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
the issues that were raised by
 
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
representative kanark and not the
 
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
content of the bill but just the
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
technical issues in the rsas that are
 
01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
cited and are are we on a motion to
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
reconsider we are not on emotion at this
 
01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:42.870 align:start position:0%
reconsider we are not on emotion at this
point

01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
it just seems inappropriate that now
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
we're opening further testimony from
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
lobbyists against the bill on a
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
irrelevant issue that doesn't have to do
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
the problem that representative canark
 
01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
was representative canark well i did
 
01:51:59.350 --> 01:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
bring up that i was concerned and
 
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
although you did allude to it in your
 
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
testimony during the hearing we and by
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
the way i did not orchestrate this they
 
01:52:07.189 --> 01:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
just showed up
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
the but the
 
01:52:11.589 --> 01:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
there was the bill original bill did not
 
01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
have this and these people were not
 
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
there to testify at the original hearing
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
which is why i felt that this was
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
actually a non-germane portion of this
 
01:52:20.229 --> 01:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
amendment because it brought in a whole
 
01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
new concept it has not been ruled as
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
such i would like to limit our
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
discussion to texas
 
01:52:28.830 --> 01:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
yes okay the other may have significant
 
01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
merit but not now
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
and i would suggest that if you see i
 
01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
don't see what you're seeing but i know
 
01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
you both entrust you both and if you're
 
01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
correct and i just haven't seen it i
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
would suggest that um you talk to the
 
01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
senate we're going to limit
 
01:52:49.030 --> 01:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
this to what representative kinork
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
not that i disagree or agree with you
 
01:52:55.589 --> 01:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
but not at this point i accept the
 
01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative's point representative
 
01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:00.229 align:start position:0%
representative's point representative
canark

01:53:00.229 --> 01:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
canark
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
no i'm i i i wanted to hear from their
 
01:53:04.790 --> 01:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
point of view anyway because they were
 
01:53:07.350 --> 01:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
not present to speak before but i think
 
01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
it should be very brief but uh we are
 
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
not we are visiting what you initially
 
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
brought up as a mistake well i also
 
01:53:19.109 --> 01:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
there is a section not also no but there
 
01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
is a secondary well there is a secondary
 
01:53:23.350 --> 01:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
feature and that is that there the
 
01:53:25.109 --> 01:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
question came up about light sorry about
 
01:53:28.470 --> 01:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes and their policies
 
01:53:30.149 --> 01:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
and you brought up that there was a
 
01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
private nursing home
 
01:53:33.589 --> 01:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
that opened in your place and it didn't
 
01:53:35.589 --> 01:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
have any impact but i have since
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
understood that that nursing home is
 
01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
really a retirement community
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
right and so the point is again there
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
were multiple things we were saying
 
01:53:45.589 --> 01:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
yesterday that were not correct and
 
01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
community ccrcs are not the same and i
 
01:53:49.109 --> 01:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
thought that we ought to get a better
 
01:53:51.030 --> 01:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
understanding when we voted
 
01:53:54.149 --> 01:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
so this was also in the mix with me i we
 
01:53:55.589 --> 01:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
were talking back there i said that i
 
01:53:58.070 --> 01:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
said and also i was concerned about this
 
01:53:58.080 --> 01:53:58.790 align:start position:0%
said and also i was concerned about this
i

01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:54:01.669 --> 01:54:01.679 align:start position:0%
but i about the section two but i think
 
01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
there's still concerns about the impact
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
upon the nursing homes i agree and i'm
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
rolling that out for this time unless
 
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
there is a motion to reconsider
 
01:54:12.390 --> 01:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
that carries
 
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
to reconsider what we did yesterday
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
01:54:19.350 --> 01:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
having voted on the prevailing side i'd
 
01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion to reconsider
 
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
and what do you wish to reconsider
 
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
i wish to reconsider
 
01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
the lines 21 and 20. now you reconsider
 
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
oh reconsider
 
01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
the bills the author sorry the other
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
pass vote which was 12 to 9. and you
 
01:54:40.229 --> 01:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
voted in the majority i remember that
 
01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
you have standing on this
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
so the motion to reconsider what we did
 
01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:46.390 align:start position:0%
so the motion to reconsider what we did
yesterday

01:54:46.390 --> 01:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
is moved by representative merchant and
 
01:54:53.669 --> 01:54:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:56.070 --> 01:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
i see no second
 
01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that a motion to reconsider
 
01:55:01.510 --> 01:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that it is out of an
 
01:55:07.270 --> 01:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
abundance of caution might someone not
 
01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
move that way just in case we don't need
 
01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
it representative snow in case we need
 
01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:13.510 align:start position:0%
it representative snow in case we need
it

01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:55:23.669 --> 01:55:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
i think you only need one person who
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
voted in the majority to reconsider but
 
01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:28.629 align:start position:0%
voted in the majority to reconsider but
i

01:55:28.629 --> 01:55:28.639 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:55:33.589 --> 01:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
and you are contacting the clerk for
 
01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:36.950 align:start position:0%
and you are contacting the clerk for
ruling

01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
ruling
 
01:55:39.430 --> 01:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
yeah fair enough let's do it right i
 
01:55:43.030 --> 01:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
mean if there is somebody who voted in
 
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
the majority who wishes to second it
 
01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
i have not seen anyone if there is
 
01:55:52.229 --> 01:55:52.239 align:start position:0%
someone you may put your hand up you
 
01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
no you can't you can't no you did not
 
01:56:09.189 --> 01:56:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
the question before us is whether it
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be seconded
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
if you're asking if somebody is asking
 
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
the clerk questions we ought to ask the
 
01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
clerk whether people who were not here
 
01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
can vote on the reconsideration i would
 
01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
think they would but i don't know that
 
01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:26.830 align:start position:0%
think they would but i don't know that
either

01:56:26.830 --> 01:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
so but
 
01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
once the motion is made the whole
 
01:56:33.510 --> 01:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
committee votes it's not just the
 
01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
prevailing people who vote that is
 
01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
correct so my question is is there some
 
01:56:39.119 --> 01:56:41.189 align:start position:0%
correct so my question is is there some
prohibition

01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
prohibition
 
01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:44.719 align:start position:0%
for people who were not here yesterday
 
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
because i
 
01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
as long as we're asking the clerk for
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
guidance we might as well find out that
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
one as well
 
01:56:53.910 --> 01:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
it makes no sense to me that a single
 
01:56:55.990 --> 01:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
person can move for reconsideration and
 
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
then it has to be seconded because it
 
01:56:59.430 --> 01:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
might be just one person who changes
 
01:57:02.149 --> 01:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
their mind then you take a vote and and
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
but i don't know the rule about
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
seconding and if the clerk has a
 
01:57:18.310 --> 01:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:21.430 --> 01:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
we may continue to discuss this before
 
01:57:23.830 --> 01:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
we decide whether we're going to revoke
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
so it seems like the issue that
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative connect was raising is he
 
01:57:30.390 --> 01:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
felt that nursing homes and rehabs
 
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
aren't included in the statutes listed
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
on lines 21 and 22 but they are
 
01:57:39.910 --> 01:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:41.109 align:start position:0%
 
d

01:57:41.109 --> 01:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
d
 
01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
which is included on line 21
 
01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:46.709 align:start position:0%
which is included on line 21
and

01:57:46.709 --> 01:57:46.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
nursing homes are covered in e
 
01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:50.229 align:start position:0%
nursing homes are covered in e
so

01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:52.149 --> 01:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
that statute does govern nursing homes
 
01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
and rehabs and we are just exempting
 
01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:55.350 align:start position:0%
and rehabs and we are just exempting
them

01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:57:56.790 --> 01:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
in from
 
01:57:59.830 --> 01:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
line 23 and line 26 a and b
 
01:58:02.950 --> 01:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
okay and that clarification
 
01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
is in on page two
 
01:58:08.070 --> 01:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
in section paragraph uh roman numeral
 
01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
two on line three sub sub paragraphs
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
one a and one b don't apply to nursing
 
01:58:16.470 --> 01:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
homes skilled nursing facilities rehabs
 
01:58:18.629 --> 01:58:18.639 align:start position:0%
intermediate cares including rehab
 
01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals and facilities offering
 
01:58:21.910 --> 01:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive rehab services
 
01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
so these are the ones that operate on
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
the membership-based business models
 
01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
they're they're in the right place
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
they're covered in that statute and it's
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
it makes it clear that it's only those
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
ones that are being exempted from those
 
01:58:35.589 --> 01:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
rules representative cushman do you see
 
01:58:37.589 --> 01:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
anything in the amendment we passed
 
01:58:37.599 --> 01:58:39.510 align:start position:0%
anything in the amendment we passed
yesterday

01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
that takes away
 
01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:42.790 align:start position:0%
that takes away
the

01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:58:45.510 --> 01:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
no new license no increased capacity for
 
01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
nursing homes in general did this
 
01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
inadvertently wipe that off the books
 
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
not in it
 
01:58:53.669 --> 01:58:53.679 align:start position:0%
not inadvertently that's what paragraph
 
01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
one is gonna do it all it takes the
 
01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
it takes away the moratorium on new new
 
01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and new um new rehab
 
01:59:03.119 --> 01:59:04.310 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and new um new rehab
facilities

01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
if they operate on a it exempts them
 
01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:08.550 align:start position:0%
if they operate on a it exempts them
if

01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:59:10.229 --> 01:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
if they operate on a membership-based
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
business model let's say catholic
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
charities wants to build another nursing
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
home the moratorium is still in place
 
01:59:20.229 --> 01:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay but it it the
 
01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
moratorium is really
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know based on the the building of
 
01:59:27.910 --> 01:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
new beds it it it it isn't so much
 
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
directed at the facilities that exist
 
01:59:33.910 --> 01:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's trying to preserve the number
 
01:59:36.629 --> 01:59:36.639 align:start position:0%
of beds that exist as of today so there
 
01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
can be no carve out for a private pay
 
01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
nursing home
 
01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:43.430 align:start position:0%
nursing home
unless

01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
unless
 
01:59:48.149 --> 01:59:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
yes yes okay so
 
01:59:53.910 --> 01:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
the existing kinds of nursing homes
 
01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
still cannot build more of without
 
01:59:58.629 --> 01:59:58.639 align:start position:0%
permission the only permission is given
 
02:00:01.510 --> 02:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
to the private pay ones
 
02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
that appears to be the case okay that is
 
02:00:05.589 --> 02:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
what you would test and i wanted to make
 
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
sure you heard that too okay good
 
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
i have a pay let's make sure we
 
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
understand not a private institution but
 
02:00:14.310 --> 02:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
private pay or membership what what yes
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
02:00:17.109 --> 02:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
whether you agree or disagree we're all
 
02:00:18.709 --> 02:00:18.719 align:start position:0%
agreed in what we did
 
02:00:18.719 --> 02:00:19.830 align:start position:0%
agreed in what we did
okay

02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:00:21.750 --> 02:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
the reconsideration needs a second but
 
02:00:22.709 --> 02:00:22.719 align:start position:0%
it doesn't need to be from the
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
prevailing side
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
every reconsideration needs a second but
 
02:00:28.629 --> 02:00:28.639 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be from the pres
 
02:00:30.550 --> 02:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
prevailing side
 
02:00:33.669 --> 02:00:33.679 align:start position:0%
and representative weber seconds now we
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
have a motion before us to reconsider
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's called a do-over
 
02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:40.390 align:start position:0%
it's called a do-over
yesterday

02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:49.990 --> 02:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
so we are now um
 
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
with this being considered an executive
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
session on a reconsideration of
 
02:00:59.189 --> 02:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
yesterday's um passing of
 
02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:01.440 align:start position:0%

but thank you so much
 
02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
it's always an order and just to say i
 
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
do believe that representative cushman
 
02:02:43.270 --> 02:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
did clarify that well i think the way
 
02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
you're saying that i'm not sure we even
 
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
have to get rid of the one a and one d
 
02:02:50.870 --> 02:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
that may have been my misinterpretation
 
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking it was too broad so i think
 
02:02:56.070 --> 02:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
that we don't have an error that we're
 
02:02:57.750 --> 02:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
propagating i don't agree with the
 
02:02:58.950 --> 02:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
policy but don't have an error
 
02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:01.830 align:start position:0%
policy but don't have an error
propagating

02:03:01.830 --> 02:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
propagating
 
02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:16.470 --> 02:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:19.040 align:start position:0%

digress
openly

02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
openly
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
opened the
 
02:04:06.550 --> 02:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
executive session on house bill 11 80
 
02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
this was originally representative
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
gould's bill and it is relative to state
 
02:04:14.310 --> 02:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
recognition of biological sex and you
 
02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
should have an amendment from
 
02:04:18.390 --> 02:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:04:27.750 --> 02:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:30.149 --> 02:04:30.159 align:start position:0%
i have a chairman's copy if somebody can
 
02:04:33.910 --> 02:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:35.109 align:start position:0%
 
1180

02:04:35.109 --> 02:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
1180
 
02:04:45.020 --> 02:04:45.030 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:50.310 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:58.750 --> 02:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
and it was a big deal when we finally at
 
02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
the school i worked at got one that ran
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
that's right and that's why i wanted to
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
make that point i guess i should
 
02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
reiterate at that point
 
02:05:48.480 --> 02:06:11.109 align:start position:0%
reiterate at that point
um

02:06:11.109 --> 02:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:11.119 --> 02:08:24.069 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:08:24.069 --> 02:08:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:26.790 --> 02:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
i hate to interrupt the time that you're
 
02:08:28.390 --> 02:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
spending writing on your various
 
02:08:33.750 --> 02:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:36.390 --> 02:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
but we are getting an amendment and uh
 
02:08:39.270 --> 02:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
it is amendment nine five nine
 
02:08:41.189 --> 02:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
from representative
 
02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:44.560 align:start position:0%

mine mine mine
 
02:09:08.069 --> 02:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
mine mine

remember that movie
 
02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:18.069 --> 02:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:27.910 --> 02:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative gay tell us what your
 
02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:30.639 align:start position:0%

02:09:41.589 --> 02:09:41.599 align:start position:0%
to house bill 1180 i wish it to pass
 
02:09:43.189 --> 02:09:43.199 align:start position:0%

02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
second by representative acton now
 
02:09:48.229 --> 02:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
representative gay if you would speak to
 
02:09:49.910 --> 02:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
your amendment
 
02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
um i found house bill 1180
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
far too in
 
02:09:54.239 --> 02:09:55.669 align:start position:0%
far too in
exclusive

02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
exclusive
 
02:09:59.510 --> 02:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
and uh but out of concern for
 
02:10:02.149 --> 02:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
for people's concerns about
 
02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
women's sports being affected by
 
02:10:11.589 --> 02:10:11.599 align:start position:0%
trans women who may have been treated
 
02:10:14.709 --> 02:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
rather recently and still
 
02:10:14.719 --> 02:10:16.390 align:start position:0%
rather recently and still
were

02:10:16.390 --> 02:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:10:19.350 --> 02:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
of competitive male standards
 
02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:20.310 align:start position:0%
of competitive male standards
and

02:10:20.310 --> 02:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
out of that concern
 
02:10:26.069 --> 02:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
i deleted two-thirds of the
 
02:10:26.079 --> 02:10:27.430 align:start position:0%
i deleted two-thirds of the
1180

02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
1180
 
02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:29.350 align:start position:0%
1180
so

02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:10:30.950 --> 02:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
it just says
 
02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:32.470 align:start position:0%
it just says
that

02:10:32.470 --> 02:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
nothing yes it just affects sports
 
02:10:38.310 --> 02:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
so nothing i'll read it nothing in the
 
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
subdivision is intended to prohibit any
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
public entity from differentiating
 
02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
between male and female sexes in
 
02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
athletic competitions
 
02:10:52.069 --> 02:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
certainly if we want to expand this we
 
02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
could get more specific about ages
 
02:10:58.550 --> 02:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
but i just kept it extremely simple
 
02:11:00.790 --> 02:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
and of course in this paragraph male and
 
02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:03.599 align:start position:0%
female sexes is biologically male and
 
02:11:03.599 --> 02:11:05.030 align:start position:0%
female sexes is biologically male and
female

02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
female
 
02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:05.910 align:start position:0%
female
so

02:11:05.910 --> 02:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:06.709 align:start position:0%
so
both

02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
both
 
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
both parts of the bill
 
02:11:10.629 --> 02:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
were in two different places so that's
 
02:11:12.550 --> 02:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
why it says it twice
 
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cannon
 
02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
in making this change
 
02:11:21.189 --> 02:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
how does it make this bill with that
 
02:11:24.229 --> 02:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
change different than legislation that
 
02:11:27.990 --> 02:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
was brought to the house last year
 
02:11:30.550 --> 02:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
we're hoping this one goes through
 
02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
that's not the no representative weber
 
02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:34.870 align:start position:0%
that's not the no representative weber
and

02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
committee researcher alert
 
02:11:39.270 --> 02:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
we may need a ruling on this whether
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
with if the amendment passes the bill is
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
too similar to a bill
 
02:11:48.629 --> 02:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
that was voted on last year
 
02:11:50.709 --> 02:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
if you would thank you representative
 
02:11:50.719 --> 02:11:53.189 align:start position:0%
if you would thank you representative
weber

02:11:53.189 --> 02:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
weber
 
02:11:55.589 --> 02:11:55.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for raising that issue and
 
02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
then the other issue i have
 
02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
and perhaps it was discussed earlier but
 
02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out what on earth
 
02:12:07.109 --> 02:12:07.119 align:start position:0%
the motor vehicle laws have to do with
 
02:12:11.350 --> 02:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:14.709 --> 02:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
personally i did not write this bill
 
02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
i was just horrified at the extent that
 
02:12:18.550 --> 02:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
it went
 
02:12:21.510 --> 02:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
so as i made the assumption
 
02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
that the attorneys who wrote it are
 
02:12:26.550 --> 02:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
assisted in writing it
 
02:12:28.709 --> 02:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
knew that it was addressed in other
 
02:12:30.790 --> 02:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
sections so i
 
02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
if if that's a
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mission i apologize it it
 
02:12:38.149 --> 02:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
it still
 
02:12:42.069 --> 02:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to me to serve any purpose
 
02:12:42.079 --> 02:12:42.950 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to me to serve any purpose
and

02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
i don't think we ought to be in the
 
02:12:48.069 --> 02:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
business of passing laws that serve no
 
02:12:50.310 --> 02:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
purpose and are not related to what
 
02:12:52.149 --> 02:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
we're talking about so
 
02:12:54.550 --> 02:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
that's a concern in this it it certainly
 
02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:55.750 align:start position:0%
that's a concern in this it it certainly
is

02:12:55.750 --> 02:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:12:59.030 --> 02:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh remove some of the concerns on behalf
 
02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
of the department of corrections and and
 
02:13:05.109 --> 02:13:05.119 align:start position:0%
places of accommodation but i still
 
02:13:08.069 --> 02:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
think it's a very very
 
02:13:16.069 --> 02:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:23.669 --> 02:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
if it was from last year on this
 
02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
particular topic
 
02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:28.069 align:start position:0%
particular topic
yes

02:13:28.069 --> 02:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
does anyone have a number it was on
 
02:13:30.239 --> 02:13:31.270 align:start position:0%
does anyone have a number it was on
banning

02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
banning
 
02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:32.790 align:start position:0%
banning
transgenders

02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
transgenders
 
02:13:34.709 --> 02:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
in sports
 
02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
it was in education
 
02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:40.870 align:start position:0%
it was in education
education

02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to get a ruling as to
 
02:13:44.709 --> 02:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
whether this actually be can can can be
 
02:13:44.719 --> 02:13:46.229 align:start position:0%
whether this actually be can can can be
considered

02:13:46.229 --> 02:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
considered
 
02:13:48.069 --> 02:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
in an amended form because then it
 
02:13:48.079 --> 02:13:49.669 align:start position:0%
in an amended form because then it
becomes

02:13:49.669 --> 02:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
close to
 
02:13:53.109 --> 02:13:53.119 align:start position:0%
the question is too close representative
 
02:13:53.119 --> 02:13:54.709 align:start position:0%
the question is too close representative
knurk

02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
knurk
 
02:13:56.069 --> 02:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
yes i
 
02:13:58.229 --> 02:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
i really don't think we need this bill
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
whether we're discussing the amendment
 
02:14:01.109 --> 02:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
we don't need the amendment because
 
02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
because it becomes the bill
 
02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
for the very simple reason that there
 
02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:06.550 align:start position:0%
for the very simple reason that there
are

02:14:06.550 --> 02:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
sports governing boards that have
 
02:14:11.189 --> 02:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
existed for a very long time that govern
 
02:14:14.709 --> 02:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
the all factors of competition
 
02:14:16.709 --> 02:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
at the high school collegiate and
 
02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
professional levels i did look and
 
02:14:19.750 --> 02:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
they're like there are hundreds of
 
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
different boards and they all have
 
02:14:22.550 --> 02:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
different policies
 
02:14:24.149 --> 02:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
they struggle with this but they look at
 
02:14:26.229 --> 02:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
the whole big picture they look at the
 
02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:27.599 align:start position:0%
question of
 
02:14:29.830 --> 02:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
um for example what uh you remember
 
02:14:31.109 --> 02:14:31.119 align:start position:0%
there were people ski jumpers who got
 
02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
disqualified for having the wrong too
 
02:14:35.109 --> 02:14:35.119 align:start position:0%
much flap in their costumes
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh all kinds of factors that they take
 
02:14:39.510 --> 02:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
into account in competition to make it
 
02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
level and even
 
02:14:42.550 --> 02:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
they have done this for a very long time
 
02:14:43.910 --> 02:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
and many of them have already addressed
 
02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:44.790 align:start position:0%
and many of them have already addressed
this

02:14:44.790 --> 02:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:14:46.310 --> 02:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
i don't think the state should be
 
02:14:49.189 --> 02:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
sticking their nose into the process
 
02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
of deciding how athletic competitions
 
02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
are governed since we have groups that
 
02:14:55.990 --> 02:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
already do that
 
02:14:58.470 --> 02:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
02:14:58.480 --> 02:14:59.270 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
um

02:14:59.270 --> 02:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:00.709 --> 02:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
and we'll find out for sure from the
 
02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
researcher but it was my impression that
 
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
last year's bill was banning
 
02:15:10.149 --> 02:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
transgenders in sports
 
02:15:13.510 --> 02:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
of of their chosen um gender
 
02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:14.470 align:start position:0%
of of their chosen um gender
this

02:15:14.470 --> 02:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
purely allows
 
02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:18.229 align:start position:0%
purely allows
a

02:15:18.229 --> 02:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:15:18.239 --> 02:15:20.069 align:start position:0%
a
subgroup

02:15:20.069 --> 02:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
subgroup
 
02:15:20.079 --> 02:15:21.189 align:start position:0%
subgroup
whatever

02:15:21.189 --> 02:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:15:22.390 --> 02:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
our team or school or whatever they are
 
02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
now allowed by law
 
02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:28.709 align:start position:0%
now allowed by law
to

02:15:28.709 --> 02:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:15:32.709 --> 02:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
have rules regarding biological sex
 
02:15:32.719 --> 02:15:34.149 align:start position:0%
have rules regarding biological sex
within

02:15:34.149 --> 02:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
within
 
02:15:36.629 --> 02:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
their um organization this just
 
02:15:36.639 --> 02:15:38.149 align:start position:0%
their um organization this just
basically

02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:15:38.159 --> 02:15:41.189 align:start position:0%
basically
um

02:15:41.189 --> 02:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:45.430 --> 02:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:47.830 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
yeah it doesn't mean they have to ban
 
02:15:52.709 --> 02:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
them it doesn't mean you know one sport
 
02:15:54.390 --> 02:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
it might not make a difference another
 
02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
sport it may
 
02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
and this gives the organizations the
 
02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:02.149 align:start position:0%
and this gives the organizations the
choice

02:16:02.149 --> 02:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro yes thank you mr
 
02:16:06.950 --> 02:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
chairman i think in our committee we
 
02:16:09.430 --> 02:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
often ask ourselves is there a problem
 
02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to actually fix
 
02:16:15.430 --> 02:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
um and so i'm just wondering if anybody
 
02:16:17.030 --> 02:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
in our committee
 
02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:19.669 align:start position:0%
in our committee
has

02:16:19.669 --> 02:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:16:22.550 --> 02:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
not really data but any
 
02:16:25.109 --> 02:16:25.119 align:start position:0%
stories even anecdotal stories about
 
02:16:27.030 --> 02:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
situations where
 
02:16:29.589 --> 02:16:29.599 align:start position:0%
competition has become a problem in new
 
02:16:29.599 --> 02:16:32.790 align:start position:0%
competition has become a problem in new
hampshire

02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:35.589 --> 02:16:35.599 align:start position:0%
i have a growing file since this bill
 
02:16:38.870 --> 02:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
was introduced in education
 
02:16:40.950 --> 02:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
maybe last year but definitely in the
 
02:16:43.750 --> 02:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
previous term and probably both
 
02:16:46.389 --> 02:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
i have a growing file on this very issue
 
02:16:49.429 --> 02:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
of which state which school
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
which competition the file continues to
 
02:16:52.559 --> 02:16:53.349 align:start position:0%
which competition the file continues to
grow

02:16:53.349 --> 02:16:53.359 align:start position:0%
grow
 
02:16:55.110 --> 02:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
i remember when i took point on this
 
02:16:57.509 --> 02:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
bill the first time
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
we could only cite a few examples
 
02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
now my file is very thick and growing so
 
02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
i do not know whether this has occurred
 
02:17:11.429 --> 02:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
yet in new hampshire but it's and i have
 
02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
not gone through the file to see with a
 
02:17:17.509 --> 02:17:17.519 align:start position:0%
list of states how many states now this
 
02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
has been a problem my guess is it is
 
02:17:21.509 --> 02:17:21.519 align:start position:0%
growing i guess it will happen here
 
02:17:21.519 --> 02:17:22.629 align:start position:0%
growing i guess it will happen here
someday

02:17:22.629 --> 02:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
someday
 
02:17:24.549 --> 02:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
and we have addressed matters in
 
02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:32.549 --> 02:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:34.389 --> 02:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:17:37.589 --> 02:17:37.599 align:start position:0%
how does this address the issue of a
 
02:17:40.870 --> 02:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
biological female taking testosterone to
 
02:17:43.429 --> 02:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
enhance their body mass to be unfair
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
competition against those they're
 
02:17:50.230 --> 02:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:53.990 --> 02:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
ncaa prohibits it i don't know what the
 
02:18:00.150 --> 02:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
rules are
 
02:18:01.669 --> 02:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
for high school
 
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
i think most of us have a gut feeling
 
02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:13.750 --> 02:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:14.870 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
the

02:18:14.870 --> 02:18:14.880 align:start position:0%

has transgender policies in place that
 
02:18:35.030 --> 02:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
will actually goes a step further than
 
02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
most policies in that it take blood
 
02:18:39.669 --> 02:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
tests to assess

and yet we are seeing again and again
 
02:18:50.709 --> 02:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
and these are the only clippings i put
 
02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
into my file

where

02:18:53.910 --> 02:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
where

an individual

who in competing in an all-male team
 
02:19:00.790 --> 02:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
was mediocre
 
02:19:04.309 --> 02:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
but now competing in a female team
 
02:19:07.110 --> 02:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
is winning and making state records
 
02:19:09.030 --> 02:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
those are the clippings i keep
 
02:19:12.549 --> 02:19:12.559 align:start position:0%

my my wonders i don't know how long it's
 
02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
going to take to get a ruling and we may
 
02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:48.389 align:start position:0%
going to take to get a ruling and we may
be

02:19:48.389 --> 02:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:19:52.070 --> 02:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
arguing a moot point i'm told we are
 
02:20:04.150 --> 02:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:06.309 --> 02:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
anybody want to sing the
 
02:20:08.469 --> 02:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
theme to jeopardy
 
02:20:09.910 --> 02:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
i know
 
02:20:12.150 --> 02:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
representative uh former speaker
 
02:20:14.150 --> 02:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
shirtless ruled that one out and he was
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:36.230 --> 02:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:40.309 --> 02:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
i'm going to make an executive decision
 
02:20:45.030 --> 02:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
and stop the um exact session on this
 
02:20:48.070 --> 02:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
bill until we have an actual ruling we
 
02:20:51.309 --> 02:20:51.319 align:start position:0%
may be expending emotion
 
02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily so
 
02:20:56.309 --> 02:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
let's go to something
 
02:20:59.670 --> 02:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
totally non-controversial
 
02:21:03.830 --> 02:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:06.070 --> 02:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
and we're do we ready to go to nursing
 
02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:09.830 align:start position:0%
and we're do we ready to go to nursing
homes

02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:11.110 align:start position:0%
 
14th

02:21:11.110 --> 02:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
14th
 
02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
yes that's what i mean you know what i
 
02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
mean we are now going to open the
 
02:21:18.349 --> 02:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
executive session on house bill
 
02:21:18.359 --> 02:21:20.230 align:start position:0%
executive session on house bill
1439

02:21:20.230 --> 02:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
1439
 
02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:21.590 align:start position:0%
1439
um

02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative rice's bill initially and
 
02:21:28.389 --> 02:21:28.399 align:start position:0%
we have another amendment for our
 
02:21:28.399 --> 02:21:29.590 align:start position:0%
we have another amendment for our
collection

02:21:29.590 --> 02:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
collection
 
02:21:31.349 --> 02:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
this one's um
 
02:21:36.630 --> 02:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
we can ignore 9.53
 
02:21:42.630 --> 02:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
we can get rid of 9.53 okay and it's
 
02:21:45.429 --> 02:21:45.439 align:start position:0%
been upgraded with inflation to 1019
 
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:51.910 --> 02:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
and how about 10 12.
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
we can also dispose of 10 12. whatever
 
02:21:56.309 --> 02:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
environmentally responsible way you
 
02:21:58.950 --> 02:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
choose i do have a fire recycled this
 
02:21:58.960 --> 02:22:00.870 align:start position:0%
choose i do have a fire recycled this
paper

02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
paper
 
02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
and the only amendment we're now looking
 
02:22:04.309 --> 02:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
at is
 
02:22:15.910 --> 02:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:18.870 --> 02:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
we're short is there any more amendments
 
02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
any extras on this side of the
 
02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:23.670 align:start position:0%
any extras on this side of the
playground

02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:26.710 --> 02:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you over here
 
02:22:30.550 --> 02:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:32.710 --> 02:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
the only amendment we're considering
 
02:22:34.830 --> 02:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
representative is 10
 
02:22:37.349 --> 02:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
19. if you've got another amendment to
 
02:22:42.790 --> 02:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:52.790 --> 02:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:55.110 --> 02:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
well she's pulling them all for
 
02:22:57.030 --> 02:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
10 19. yes
 
02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:00.800 --> 02:23:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:23:04.150 --> 02:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm just reminding you that we still
 
02:23:07.670 --> 02:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
have the issue of 9 46. this chair
 
02:23:11.270 --> 02:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
stands corrected 946 by representative
 
02:23:14.550 --> 02:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
weber is still in play i beg your pardon
 
02:23:16.790 --> 02:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the correction and right
 
02:23:18.389 --> 02:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
there on the piece of paper that tells
 
02:23:24.230 --> 02:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:26.790 --> 02:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
representative leon would you wish to
 
02:23:28.950 --> 02:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
would you please speak to your amendment
 
02:23:31.429 --> 02:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
which is 10 19.
 
02:23:33.510 --> 02:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative knurk you will find that
 
02:23:38.469 --> 02:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
what you were looking for on line 23 of
 
02:23:40.389 --> 02:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
page 1.
 
02:23:43.190 --> 02:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
the care and rights of other patients
 
02:23:45.910 --> 02:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
are paramount and i greatly thank you
 
02:23:47.190 --> 02:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
for finding that oversight in the
 
02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:50.230 align:start position:0%
for finding that oversight in the
drafting

02:23:50.230 --> 02:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
now that this has been corrected and
 
02:23:55.429 --> 02:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
also says if the patient's incapacitated
 
02:23:57.349 --> 02:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
and not their representative i thank you
 
02:23:59.590 --> 02:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
for that representative snow
 
02:24:01.270 --> 02:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
these are important changes we are
 
02:24:03.830 --> 02:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
writing law here
 
02:24:05.030 --> 02:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
we now
 
02:24:07.030 --> 02:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
have added back in the presence of
 
02:24:08.309 --> 02:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
visitors which we medically or
 
02:24:10.070 --> 02:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
therapeutically contraindicated in the
 
02:24:11.830 --> 02:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
best clinical judgment of healthcare
 
02:24:14.070 --> 02:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
professionals with documenting that and
 
02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
making it available
 
02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
it stays within the licensing statutes
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
but that should provide
 
02:24:23.349 --> 02:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
a good way to document when access to
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
visitors is denied for something other
 
02:24:28.469 --> 02:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
than the written hospital policy
 
02:24:30.469 --> 02:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
i would expect that disruptive
 
02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
threatening or violent behavior towards
 
02:24:34.790 --> 02:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
any staff member patient or any visitor
 
02:24:37.030 --> 02:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
would be in the security logs so that
 
02:24:39.830 --> 02:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
will also protect the hospital if
 
02:24:41.670 --> 02:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
if jane is a little upset about her
 
02:24:43.349 --> 02:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
husband's treatment and she starts
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
getting agitated the security will have
 
02:24:48.150 --> 02:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
a note of that so the hospital won't
 
02:24:50.150 --> 02:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
likely won't be at risk from jane coming
 
02:24:51.510 --> 02:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
back and saying that she was a sweet
 
02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:53.429 align:start position:0%
back and saying that she was a sweet
princess

02:24:53.429 --> 02:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
princess
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
as we look at all of this it provides
 
02:24:57.429 --> 02:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
protections for the patient
 
02:24:58.790 --> 02:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
having visitors
 
02:25:00.710 --> 02:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
and now that we've strengthened this it
 
02:25:02.790 --> 02:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
provides a lot better paper trail for
 
02:25:04.150 --> 02:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
the hospitals as well to protect
 
02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:05.190 align:start position:0%
the hospitals as well to protect
themselves

02:25:05.190 --> 02:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
02:25:08.070 --> 02:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
if no hospitals are unduly denying
 
02:25:10.309 --> 02:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
visitors today then this is not a threat
 
02:25:12.389 --> 02:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
to the hospitals
 
02:25:14.309 --> 02:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
and i believe that putting this in
 
02:25:15.990 --> 02:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
licensing is the best way to go forward
 
02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
to respect all stakeholders
 
02:25:18.240 --> 02:25:19.190 align:start position:0%
to respect all stakeholders
so

02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:25:21.590 --> 02:25:21.600 align:start position:0%

02:25:40.469 --> 02:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
talks about the policy being in writing
 
02:25:43.830 --> 02:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
um yes on line 26 of page one it says
 
02:25:46.070 --> 02:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
visitors are non-compliant with written
 
02:25:48.550 --> 02:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
hospital policy thank you
 
02:25:51.030 --> 02:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
it also states which is appropriate
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
since this is
 
02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
a requirement on the facilities
 
02:25:55.200 --> 02:25:56.070 align:start position:0%
a requirement on the facilities
that

02:25:56.070 --> 02:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:59.030 align:start position:0%
that
they

02:25:59.030 --> 02:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:00.550 --> 02:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
somewhere it says that they have to post
 
02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:01.590 align:start position:0%
somewhere it says that they have to post
it

02:26:01.590 --> 02:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:26:04.630 --> 02:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
yes on page 2 lines 12 and 13 each
 
02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
healthcare facility licensed pursuant to
 
02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:07.230 align:start position:0%
healthcare facility licensed pursuant to
one

02:26:07.230 --> 02:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:26:09.990 --> 02:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
rsa1512 shall post on its website
 
02:26:11.670 --> 02:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
informational materials explaining the
 
02:26:13.990 --> 02:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
rights specified in this section
 
02:26:15.830 --> 02:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
so it provides for transparency it
 
02:26:18.150 --> 02:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
provides for information it makes it so
 
02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:19.270 align:start position:0%
provides for information it makes it so
that

02:26:19.270 --> 02:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:26:20.710 --> 02:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
if you actually look and see what's
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
going on you know what to expect and
 
02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
that should diffuse a lot of these
 
02:26:27.429 --> 02:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
emotional situations that are happening
 
02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
because you know our first response our
 
02:26:31.590 --> 02:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
medical professionals are doing so much
 
02:26:34.150 --> 02:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
for us if we can just point to a clear
 
02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
policy and make it not be personal make
 
02:26:38.469 --> 02:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
it be written
 
02:26:40.389 --> 02:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
i think it's going to go a long way to
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:47.590 --> 02:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
well i'm going to say that the the weber
 
02:26:51.670 --> 02:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
amendment also
 
02:26:53.349 --> 02:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
satisfies all of those things it's
 
02:26:56.070 --> 02:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
written it's not personal it's available
 
02:26:57.429 --> 02:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
i think it's
 
02:26:57.439 --> 02:26:58.230 align:start position:0%
i think it's
far

02:26:58.230 --> 02:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
far
 
02:26:58.240 --> 02:26:59.750 align:start position:0%
far
clearer

02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
clearer
 
02:27:03.270 --> 02:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
in the weber amendment
 
02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:05.830 align:start position:0%
in the weber amendment
because

02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:27:08.469 --> 02:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
the policy is set out
 
02:27:10.230 --> 02:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
in writing
 
02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
in the patient's bill of rights whereas
 
02:27:14.150 --> 02:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
the patient's bill of rights that will
 
02:27:17.190 --> 02:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
be posted under this one will just give
 
02:27:20.230 --> 02:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
a statutory reference which doesn't help
 
02:27:22.790 --> 02:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
a patient in crisis
 
02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:23.590 align:start position:0%
a patient in crisis
i

02:27:23.590 --> 02:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:27:25.590 --> 02:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate the
 
02:27:30.710 --> 02:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
adding back in of both a at online 17
 
02:27:33.910 --> 02:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
and b on line 23
 
02:27:36.469 --> 02:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
but i think that in the midst of a
 
02:27:39.190 --> 02:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
medical crisis when resources are
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
stretched to their limits
 
02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
asking for the health care professionals
 
02:27:48.550 --> 02:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
who are trying to save people's lives
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
to have to do
 
02:27:54.230 --> 02:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
extra additional documentation
 
02:27:56.790 --> 02:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
of the visiting policies
 
02:27:56.800 --> 02:27:57.670 align:start position:0%
of the visiting policies
is

02:27:57.670 --> 02:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:28:01.750 --> 02:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:04.070 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:06.150 --> 02:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
may or may not vote for the amendment
 
02:28:08.070 --> 02:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it's certainly better than
 
02:28:09.910 --> 02:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
what we started with but
 
02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:10.790 align:start position:0%
what we started with but
i

02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:28:12.950 --> 02:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
think i will be voting itl on the whole
 
02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:15.590 align:start position:0%
think i will be voting itl on the whole
thing

02:28:15.590 --> 02:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:17.830 --> 02:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
and i would welcome hearing others ideas
 
02:28:20.070 --> 02:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
about the amendment
 
02:28:22.389 --> 02:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
the amendment meaning your amendment
 
02:28:24.790 --> 02:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
the meaning any amendment the amendment
 
02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
meaning the leon amendment because we've
 
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
discussed mine ad nauseam and that's
 
02:28:31.030 --> 02:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's the one i would like but i
 
02:28:33.190 --> 02:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
suspect that you're not going to i mean
 
02:28:34.870 --> 02:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
if i
 
02:28:36.710 --> 02:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
move mine i suspect you're not going to
 
02:28:38.230 --> 02:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
take that motion i suspect you're going
 
02:28:40.070 --> 02:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
to take this motion first and it's going
 
02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
to be dispositive so
 
02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:44.309 align:start position:0%
to be dispositive so
yep

02:28:44.309 --> 02:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:28:46.950 --> 02:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative anybody other wanting to
 
02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:53.910 --> 02:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
i'd like to hear from the hospital
 
02:28:53.920 --> 02:28:55.830 align:start position:0%
i'd like to hear from the hospital
association

02:28:55.830 --> 02:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
association
 
02:28:58.710 --> 02:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
as to do we have a paula minahan anyone
 
02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
named paula minahan she's not here
 
02:29:02.870 --> 02:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
anymore she's not here anymore
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
there's something
 
02:29:06.630 --> 02:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
about having something on the wall
 
02:29:09.990 --> 02:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
posted that makes it clear
 
02:29:11.910 --> 02:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
as opposed to it being
 
02:29:13.349 --> 02:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
equally true
 
02:29:14.950 --> 02:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
but in
 
02:29:17.429 --> 02:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
you have to go look up
 
02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
we have printed policies in our facility
 
02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
for a reason
 
02:29:23.910 --> 02:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
and it's so immediately the professional
 
02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
can point to it
 
02:29:28.710 --> 02:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
and there is something of value to that
 
02:29:31.590 --> 02:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
i think representative gay
 
02:29:33.670 --> 02:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
is this there's nothing in here that i
 
02:29:36.550 --> 02:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
see that would prohibit making the
 
02:29:36.560 --> 02:29:38.030 align:start position:0%
see that would prohibit making the
policies

02:29:38.030 --> 02:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
policies
 
02:29:40.950 --> 02:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
available and posted
 
02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
the the most important thing instead of
 
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
telling they have to do it because it
 
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
could be extensive i do like the idea of
 
02:29:50.469 --> 02:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
it being posted
 
02:29:50.479 --> 02:29:51.590 align:start position:0%
it being posted
but

02:29:51.590 --> 02:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:29:54.230 --> 02:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
but the most important aspect of this
 
02:29:57.429 --> 02:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
bill is to make sure that it's where
 
02:29:59.270 --> 02:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
if it's violated
 
02:30:00.790 --> 02:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
there's a pain
 
02:30:04.309 --> 02:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
because we have too many stories sad
 
02:30:06.950 --> 02:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
stories about people being denied being
 
02:30:09.830 --> 02:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
with their loved ones in the hospital so
 
02:30:12.389 --> 02:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
we can't just put it in one place that
 
02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't have teeth that's a convenience
 
02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
that i really support posting it
 
02:30:21.190 --> 02:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
that's a convenience for the people
 
02:30:23.670 --> 02:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
who need to know they have rights
 
02:30:26.309 --> 02:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
but it also is very important to make
 
02:30:26.319 --> 02:30:27.429 align:start position:0%
but it also is very important to make
sure

02:30:27.429 --> 02:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:30:27.439 --> 02:30:28.710 align:start position:0%
sure
this

02:30:28.710 --> 02:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:30:31.030 --> 02:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
law this bill whatever you want to call
 
02:30:34.150 --> 02:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
it gets followed and if there's no teeth
 
02:30:36.309 --> 02:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
to it and it's inconvenient and we've
 
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
seen it
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
happen many times where the hospital
 
02:30:41.990 --> 02:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
decided it was inconvenient so they just
 
02:30:47.190 --> 02:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
said that's our policy you can't visit
 
02:30:49.030 --> 02:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
and if it would seem let me pick up on
 
02:30:51.110 --> 02:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
your point representative gay if it
 
02:30:51.120 --> 02:30:52.550 align:start position:0%
your point representative gay if it
seems

02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
seems
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
that it would have been helpful i think
 
02:30:56.950 --> 02:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's future perfect
 
02:30:58.230 --> 02:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
tense um
 
02:31:00.950 --> 02:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
that these things were posted on the
 
02:31:04.230 --> 02:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
wall they must be posted in every room
 
02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
and they're not being posted
 
02:31:08.870 --> 02:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
has led to some problems we can always
 
02:31:11.990 --> 02:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:14.790 --> 02:31:14.800 align:start position:0%

if you look at line 26

02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
statute to a certain degree
 
02:31:41.349 --> 02:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
could be nullified by the written
 
02:31:43.830 --> 02:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
hospital policy and i concur with the
 
02:31:46.230 --> 02:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
fact that most patients don't have
 
02:31:48.790 --> 02:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
access to a hospital policy what they do
 
02:31:51.510 --> 02:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
have access to is their bill of rights
 
02:31:53.429 --> 02:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
i think i really want to educate the
 
02:31:55.110 --> 02:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
public and educate the patients and
 
02:31:56.870 --> 02:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
educate their visitors
 
02:31:59.349 --> 02:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
about what their rights are it should be
 
02:32:01.190 --> 02:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
better in the posting on the bill of
 
02:32:01.200 --> 02:32:02.389 align:start position:0%
better in the posting on the bill of
rights

02:32:02.389 --> 02:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:32:04.550 --> 02:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
because that's where the patients are
 
02:32:06.389 --> 02:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
going to look they're not going to look
 
02:32:08.469 --> 02:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
for hospital policy and quite frankly
 
02:32:10.630 --> 02:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
the hospital public policy can nullify a
 
02:32:11.750 --> 02:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
lot of this
 
02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
so i would say at this point in time the
 
02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
logical place to put it is in a
 
02:32:16.550 --> 02:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights so the patients
 
02:32:17.990 --> 02:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
could in fact
 
02:32:18.950 --> 02:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
see it
 
02:32:21.429 --> 02:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
time and time again and know that they
 
02:32:23.270 --> 02:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
have within the bill of rights what
 
02:32:25.590 --> 02:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
their rights are not trying to penalize
 
02:32:27.110 --> 02:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
the hospital but i think if you enforce
 
02:32:29.750 --> 02:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
the patient and educate the patient that
 
02:32:31.910 --> 02:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
in itself will bring a lot of bear to
 
02:32:33.750 --> 02:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
the hospital itself
 
02:32:37.429 --> 02:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:37.439 --> 02:32:38.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:32:38.550 --> 02:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:42.070 --> 02:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
as far as the way i'm reading it
 
02:32:43.510 --> 02:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
sorry it's been
 
02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's dry in here um
 
02:32:48.630 --> 02:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
it this does not
 
02:32:48.640 --> 02:32:49.590 align:start position:0%
it this does not
um

02:32:49.590 --> 02:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:52.550 --> 02:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm wrong but this does not stop
 
02:32:54.550 --> 02:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
the hospital from putting some line in
 
02:32:57.910 --> 02:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
the patient's bill of rights to clarify
 
02:33:01.349 --> 02:33:01.359 align:start position:0%
this if they want to add it to
 
02:33:04.389 --> 02:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
oh that's a statute okay thank you
 
02:33:06.550 --> 02:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
while it doesn't prevent them from doing
 
02:33:08.870 --> 02:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
so apparently they have not done it yet
 
02:33:10.389 --> 02:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
so that's why we're here
 
02:33:12.309 --> 02:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
02:33:12.319 --> 02:33:13.510 align:start position:0%
representative um
weber

02:33:13.510 --> 02:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
weber
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
well i want to make it clear the the
 
02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights is a statutory
 
02:33:19.670 --> 02:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
thing and you can't put extra words in
 
02:33:21.830 --> 02:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
or take extra words out
 
02:33:24.550 --> 02:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
i suppose if somebody wanted to explain
 
02:33:27.670 --> 02:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
what the visitation policy was
 
02:33:30.389 --> 02:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
once they had posted
 
02:33:32.389 --> 02:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
the patient's bill of rights they could
 
02:33:34.550 --> 02:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
underneath that
 
02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:35.670 align:start position:0%
underneath that
post

02:33:35.670 --> 02:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
post
 
02:33:38.309 --> 02:33:38.319 align:start position:0%
the reference to this thing here but
 
02:33:42.550 --> 02:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
that makes a very long and very unwieldy
 
02:33:45.110 --> 02:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
process and i have
 
02:33:48.550 --> 02:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
now recovered my wits from my last
 
02:33:50.710 --> 02:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
thing about trying to figure out whether
 
02:33:52.309 --> 02:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
i wanted to vote for this amendment
 
02:33:53.830 --> 02:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
because it was better than the last one
 
02:33:56.150 --> 02:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
or not welcome back i
 
02:33:57.750 --> 02:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
well maybe
 
02:34:00.950 --> 02:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
um i i truly think it should not be in
 
02:34:03.830 --> 02:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
the licensing statute that was the
 
02:34:06.469 --> 02:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
difficulty underlying difficulty
 
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
and i also
 
02:34:10.550 --> 02:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
don't think that
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
rights of patients should be expressed
 
02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:13.990 align:start position:0%
rights of patients should be expressed
in

02:34:13.990 --> 02:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
references to statute
 
02:34:19.590 --> 02:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
so i will be voting no on the amendment
 
02:34:22.469 --> 02:34:22.479 align:start position:0%
if that's the next thing that comes up
 
02:34:23.990 --> 02:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
i would urge people to vote this
 
02:34:26.070 --> 02:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
amendment down and so that we could
 
02:34:27.990 --> 02:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
bring up the weber amendment
 
02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:29.429 align:start position:0%
bring up the weber amendment
which

02:34:29.429 --> 02:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:34:29.439 --> 02:34:30.469 align:start position:0%
which
contains

02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
contains
 
02:34:32.790 --> 02:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
the same thoughts
 
02:34:34.389 --> 02:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
does not
 
02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
overly burden hospital workers in an
 
02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
emergency which is the only time when
 
02:34:42.630 --> 02:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
people don't get to see their patients
 
02:34:44.389 --> 02:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
their they're people in a hospital it's
 
02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
either an emergency or a highly highly
 
02:34:49.510 --> 02:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
infectious situation which would
 
02:34:54.389 --> 02:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
fall under either a or b
 
02:34:57.349 --> 02:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
so let's not put roadblocks in hospital
 
02:34:59.270 --> 02:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
workers way when they're trying to deal
 
02:35:01.349 --> 02:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
with a desperate situation
 
02:35:03.910 --> 02:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:35:04.870 --> 02:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:35:08.469 --> 02:35:08.479 align:start position:0%
i see no reason why we can't
 
02:35:09.910 --> 02:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
ask put
 
02:35:12.389 --> 02:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
amend this or this bill or somewhere
 
02:35:15.030 --> 02:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
else to put it since you need statutory
 
02:35:17.910 --> 02:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
approval to put something in
 
02:35:19.190 --> 02:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
the rights
 
02:35:21.190 --> 02:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
the patient bill of rights i have no
 
02:35:23.030 --> 02:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
problem with it being in the patient
 
02:35:25.910 --> 02:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
bill of rights somewhere on a big
 
02:35:27.830 --> 02:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
letters that people see
 
02:35:30.309 --> 02:35:30.319 align:start position:0%
but i have a big problem saying oh it
 
02:35:31.910 --> 02:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
can't be in
 
02:35:35.190 --> 02:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
um where this bill proposes to put it in
 
02:35:37.429 --> 02:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
in a place that has teeth
 
02:35:40.230 --> 02:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
because we've seen too many times for
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
the convenience of the administration
 
02:35:46.550 --> 02:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
and lord knows who
 
02:35:48.550 --> 02:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
the people were denied
 
02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
these rights
 
02:35:52.389 --> 02:35:52.399 align:start position:0%
and i think it has to be where it's
 
02:35:55.349 --> 02:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
taken seriously but that shouldn't have
 
02:35:59.830 --> 02:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
to exclude it from easy access by the
 
02:36:02.630 --> 02:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
visitors and the patients
 
02:36:04.870 --> 02:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
02:36:07.670 --> 02:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
02:36:10.230 --> 02:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
first i would like to say that when i
 
02:36:11.990 --> 02:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
was i when i was in private practice
 
02:36:13.990 --> 02:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
there's a mental health bill of rights
 
02:36:15.670 --> 02:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:36:18.309 --> 02:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
i had to have that on the wall and it it
 
02:36:21.030 --> 02:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
was actually a source of conversation
 
02:36:23.190 --> 02:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
starter about what we were actually
 
02:36:25.429 --> 02:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
doing together and in the best of all
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances that's what the
 
02:36:29.670 --> 02:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
bill writes for a medical patient would
 
02:36:31.510 --> 02:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
be as well
 
02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
an interactive
 
02:36:35.270 --> 02:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
an interactive
 
02:36:37.990 --> 02:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
documented interactive process
 
02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:39.990 align:start position:0%
documented interactive process
so

02:36:39.990 --> 02:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:36:42.150 --> 02:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
i do support it being in the
 
02:36:47.670 --> 02:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:49.750 --> 02:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
i'm having a hard time with people
 
02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
02:36:54.870 --> 02:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals restricting visitation because
 
02:36:56.790 --> 02:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
it's inconvenient for them
 
02:36:59.349 --> 02:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm certainly i don't know all
 
02:37:00.950 --> 02:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
the details i don't know all the
 
02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:02.950 align:start position:0%
the details i don't know all the
situations

02:37:02.950 --> 02:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
situations
 
02:37:05.510 --> 02:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
i have to believe that hospitals have
 
02:37:07.750 --> 02:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
made mistakes at times in terms of the
 
02:37:10.710 --> 02:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
restrictions that they've created
 
02:37:13.830 --> 02:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
but i think it is really unfair of us to
 
02:37:16.230 --> 02:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
sit in judgments of hospitals that were
 
02:37:19.110 --> 02:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with um
 
02:37:24.870 --> 02:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:26.950 --> 02:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
unprecedented it's too you know we use
 
02:37:28.950 --> 02:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
that word too often but unprecedented
 
02:37:32.469 --> 02:37:32.479 align:start position:0%
situations and um i have to believe that
 
02:37:33.990 --> 02:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
they were really trying to do the best
 
02:37:36.550 --> 02:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
that they could and not only that but
 
02:37:39.349 --> 02:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
in most cases did the best
 
02:37:41.110 --> 02:37:41.120 align:start position:0%
and so i think
 
02:37:42.870 --> 02:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
i would just suggest that people be
 
02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
careful about
 
02:37:46.550 --> 02:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
talking about medical providers who have
 
02:37:48.550 --> 02:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
been under such duress
 
02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:49.750 align:start position:0%
been under such duress
um

02:37:49.750 --> 02:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:50.710 align:start position:0%
um
as

02:37:50.710 --> 02:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:37:52.870 --> 02:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
not caring really and just acting out of
 
02:37:54.950 --> 02:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
their own convenience
 
02:37:54.960 --> 02:37:56.070 align:start position:0%
their own convenience
as

02:37:56.070 --> 02:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:37:58.550 --> 02:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
a part-time ceo of a medical counseling
 
02:38:02.389 --> 02:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:05.590 --> 02:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
accuse us
 
02:38:09.190 --> 02:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
of uncaring
 
02:38:13.349 --> 02:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
and while i suggest our facility has
 
02:38:15.910 --> 02:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
less than perfection
 
02:38:18.790 --> 02:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
don't you ever accuse us
 
02:38:21.670 --> 02:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
of being uncaring
 
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
and i understand
 
02:38:26.309 --> 02:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
the frustrations my staff had to work
 
02:38:26.319 --> 02:38:27.349 align:start position:0%
the frustrations my staff had to work
through

02:38:27.349 --> 02:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
to provide as always the excellent care
 
02:38:32.230 --> 02:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
now you also know i have another
 
02:38:33.750 --> 02:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
part-time job
 
02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
and i have people in hospital that i
 
02:38:38.309 --> 02:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
would have liked to bring the sacrament
 
02:38:40.309 --> 02:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
to and pray with
 
02:38:42.950 --> 02:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
and i have never
 
02:38:44.469 --> 02:38:44.479 align:start position:0%
throughout the two years of this
 
02:38:44.479 --> 02:38:45.990 align:start position:0%
throughout the two years of this
pandemic

02:38:45.990 --> 02:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:38:49.670 --> 02:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
heard a restriction placed on me
 
02:38:51.910 --> 02:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
that i objected to
 
02:38:53.590 --> 02:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
i didn't like it
 
02:38:56.870 --> 02:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
i wished it were otherwise but i got it
 
02:38:59.429 --> 02:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
and when i asked for
 
02:38:59.439 --> 02:39:00.710 align:start position:0%
and when i asked for
reasons

02:39:00.710 --> 02:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
02:39:02.790 --> 02:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
identifying who i was
 
02:39:05.910 --> 02:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
i was satisfied with the reasons
 
02:39:07.750 --> 02:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative shapiro i
 
02:39:11.910 --> 02:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:14.550 --> 02:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm sorry to pile on but i need
 
02:39:17.910 --> 02:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
to express my extreme concern about the
 
02:39:19.670 --> 02:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
convent about
 
02:39:21.670 --> 02:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
the fact that people were excluded for
 
02:39:24.710 --> 02:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
the convenience of the administration
 
02:39:27.270 --> 02:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
because i don't think hospitals or other
 
02:39:30.469 --> 02:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
health care facilities ever do that
 
02:39:30.479 --> 02:39:31.990 align:start position:0%
health care facilities ever do that
and

02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:35.190 --> 02:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
yes it was awful it was awful for the
 
02:39:37.110 --> 02:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
people who were excluded it was awful
 
02:39:40.150 --> 02:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
for the people who died alone
 
02:39:41.670 --> 02:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
and i don't want that to happen to
 
02:39:44.309 --> 02:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
anybody but to say that that was done
 
02:39:45.590 --> 02:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
for the convenience of the
 
02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:47.270 align:start position:0%
for the convenience of the
administration

02:39:47.270 --> 02:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
administration
 
02:39:48.550 --> 02:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
in a time
 
02:39:50.790 --> 02:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
of extreme duress
 
02:39:53.429 --> 02:39:53.439 align:start position:0%
is just as far as i'm concerned
 
02:39:55.830 --> 02:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
reprehensible so i'm just expressing my
 
02:39:58.710 --> 02:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
objection to it and representative um
 
02:40:01.270 --> 02:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
weber as i shared with you yesterday on
 
02:40:03.830 --> 02:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
behalf of this committee i apologized
 
02:40:05.270 --> 02:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
for that comment
 
02:40:08.150 --> 02:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
to paula minihan and anyone
 
02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
who runs a hospital and anybody who
 
02:40:11.910 --> 02:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
listened to
 
02:40:15.269 --> 02:40:15.279 align:start position:0%
this hearing yesterday and
 
02:40:17.910 --> 02:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
and it was now made again today
 
02:40:19.190 --> 02:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
02:40:22.550 --> 02:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative acton
 
02:40:26.070 --> 02:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
i do i do want to convey a couple of um
 
02:40:28.389 --> 02:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
realizations i had during this cove
 
02:40:28.399 --> 02:40:30.070 align:start position:0%
realizations i had during this cove
situation

02:40:30.070 --> 02:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:40:31.349 --> 02:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
the if
 
02:40:34.950 --> 02:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
at first i saw a coarsening of attitudes
 
02:40:36.630 --> 02:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
and it was amongst my friends who were
 
02:40:38.950 --> 02:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
our patient care providers
 
02:40:40.389 --> 02:40:40.399 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:40:43.590 --> 02:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
i just the the daily
 
02:40:46.309 --> 02:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
immersion in in this deadly situation
 
02:40:47.750 --> 02:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
like a friend of mine works at the
 
02:40:49.670 --> 02:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
elliott um
 
02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:51.349 align:start position:0%
elliott um
e.d

02:40:51.349 --> 02:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
e.d
 
02:40:54.469 --> 02:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
it just it tends to lead you to
 
02:40:54.479 --> 02:40:55.429 align:start position:0%
it just it tends to lead you to
to

02:40:55.429 --> 02:40:55.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:40:57.110 --> 02:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
coarse in your attitude simply because
 
02:40:59.830 --> 02:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
you have to separate yourself
 
02:41:01.190 --> 02:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
mentally from
 
02:41:03.429 --> 02:41:03.439 align:start position:0%
from the trauma that's going around on
 
02:41:05.349 --> 02:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
around you or else it could
 
02:41:05.359 --> 02:41:06.309 align:start position:0%
around you or else it could
um

02:41:06.309 --> 02:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:07.670 --> 02:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
drive you crazy
 
02:41:09.990 --> 02:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
um but then i like for instance i went
 
02:41:11.190 --> 02:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
down to the
 
02:41:14.150 --> 02:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
booster blitz down in stratham
 
02:41:15.269 --> 02:41:15.279 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:41:17.750 --> 02:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
the first responders and firemen are
 
02:41:18.790 --> 02:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
running the thing
 
02:41:21.750 --> 02:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
had had the line of people standing out
 
02:41:21.760 --> 02:41:22.550 align:start position:0%
had had the line of people standing out
in

02:41:22.550 --> 02:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:41:24.950 --> 02:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
a torrential downpour in the beginning
 
02:41:27.910 --> 02:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
of december it was raining like it was
 
02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:28.550 align:start position:0%
of december it was raining like it was
a

02:41:28.550 --> 02:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:41:30.710 --> 02:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
mid-july storm and it was about 38
 
02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:31.750 align:start position:0%
mid-july storm and it was about 38
degrees

02:41:31.750 --> 02:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
degrees
 
02:41:33.190 --> 02:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
and they had no
 
02:41:35.670 --> 02:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
no way to get out of the rain so there
 
02:41:35.680 --> 02:41:36.550 align:start position:0%
no way to get out of the rain so there
was

02:41:36.550 --> 02:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:41:38.950 --> 02:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
average age 60 65 standing or getting
 
02:41:41.030 --> 02:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
soaked and everyone's just standing
 
02:41:43.269 --> 02:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
looking at the ground and the firemen
 
02:41:44.950 --> 02:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
were all standing inside
 
02:41:46.710 --> 02:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
looking out and knowing it never
 
02:41:48.309 --> 02:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
occurred to anybody jesus we could swing
 
02:41:50.389 --> 02:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
this line around over here and everybody
 
02:41:50.399 --> 02:41:51.830 align:start position:0%
this line around over here and everybody
undercover

02:41:51.830 --> 02:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
undercover
 
02:41:53.990 --> 02:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
no and and so when i got up to the front
 
02:41:56.469 --> 02:41:56.479 align:start position:0%
i asked the first person why are we all
 
02:41:57.670 --> 02:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
standing out in the rain here was
 
02:42:00.630 --> 02:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
totally soaked and she's like not my job
 
02:42:02.230 --> 02:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
so i said well whose job is this mr
 
02:42:04.389 --> 02:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
chairman i have an objection we have a
 
02:42:06.150 --> 02:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
statute in front of us that's about
 
02:42:07.830 --> 02:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
visiting rights in the hospital not
 
02:42:10.230 --> 02:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
about lines in the rain in
 
02:42:11.830 --> 02:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
covet vaccinations i think he's trying
 
02:42:14.309 --> 02:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
to draw a parallel and i'm encouraging
 
02:42:15.990 --> 02:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
him to draw it more quickly thank you
 
02:42:18.870 --> 02:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
02:42:21.030 --> 02:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
what i found was a continued level of
 
02:42:23.910 --> 02:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
coarsening of attitudes which is
 
02:42:26.309 --> 02:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
happens and that's happened in hospitals
 
02:42:27.670 --> 02:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:42:30.230 --> 02:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not faulting it i'm not i understand
 
02:42:32.469 --> 02:42:32.479 align:start position:0%
the situation but it is happening and i
 
02:42:34.469 --> 02:42:34.479 align:start position:0%
think we need teeth in this
 
02:42:36.790 --> 02:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
so that we can enforce
 
02:42:38.630 --> 02:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
and let the hospitals know in no
 
02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
uncertain terms that they have to deal
 
02:42:42.230 --> 02:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
with family and i'm sure it's annoying
 
02:42:44.790 --> 02:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it's terrible having you know a
 
02:42:47.110 --> 02:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
lot of these families brought were
 
02:42:49.269 --> 02:42:49.279 align:start position:0%
visited visitation brought coveted into
 
02:42:51.349 --> 02:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
the some of these facilities
 
02:42:53.590 --> 02:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
but we have to work it out and we have
 
02:42:56.230 --> 02:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
to let the hospitals know that the the
 
02:42:58.710 --> 02:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
there needs to be visitation access and
 
02:43:00.550 --> 02:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
what happened in the beginning of it can
 
02:43:02.150 --> 02:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
never happen again
 
02:43:04.550 --> 02:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
my conversations with various medical
 
02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:05.910 align:start position:0%
my conversations with various medical
administrator

02:43:05.910 --> 02:43:05.920 align:start position:0%

02:43:08.389 --> 02:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
colleagues in much larger and similar
 
02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
size facilities is we had a learning
 
02:43:10.800 --> 02:43:12.469 align:start position:0%
size facilities is we had a learning
curve

02:43:12.469 --> 02:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
curve
 
02:43:14.870 --> 02:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
i wound up doing debriefing
 
02:43:17.429 --> 02:43:17.439 align:start position:0%
of my staff members individually because
 
02:43:18.950 --> 02:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the stress
 
02:43:20.630 --> 02:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
that they were under i'm not qualified
 
02:43:22.950 --> 02:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
to diagnose ptsd but i know it when i
 
02:43:23.910 --> 02:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
see it
 
02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:25.349 align:start position:0%
see it
and

02:43:25.349 --> 02:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:29.110 --> 02:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:29.120 --> 02:43:30.070 align:start position:0%
 
needed

02:43:30.070 --> 02:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:43:32.630 --> 02:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
the safety valve of debriefing because
 
02:43:34.950 --> 02:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
they themselves even reported themselves
 
02:43:36.790 --> 02:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
to me saying my attitude is stinking and
 
02:43:38.230 --> 02:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
i just said something to somebody i
 
02:43:40.950 --> 02:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have understood but let's not
 
02:43:42.790 --> 02:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
repeat it so yeah there's been a
 
02:43:45.990 --> 02:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
learning curve and we want to encourage
 
02:43:54.070 --> 02:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:54.080 --> 02:43:54.950 align:start position:0%
 
mike

02:43:54.950 --> 02:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
mike
 
02:43:57.510 --> 02:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
i want to apologize for my poor choice
 
02:43:59.830 --> 02:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
of words there was a lot of hard
 
02:44:02.950 --> 02:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
feelings from administration not only to
 
02:44:05.910 --> 02:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
patients but to their own staff
 
02:44:08.550 --> 02:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
i've heard sad stories about that and i
 
02:44:10.230 --> 02:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
was guilty of that too representative
 
02:44:11.830 --> 02:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your apology
 
02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
02:44:15.590 --> 02:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman
 
02:44:17.510 --> 02:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
i actually took the patient bill of
 
02:44:19.429 --> 02:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
rights out of the statute it's two pages
 
02:44:22.309 --> 02:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
long if we add this language to it it'll
 
02:44:24.150 --> 02:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
go from a two-page document to three and
 
02:44:25.830 --> 02:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
a half pages
 
02:44:28.309 --> 02:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
on my amendment on the second page line
 
02:44:31.269 --> 02:44:31.279 align:start position:0%
26 it references it
 
02:44:35.110 --> 02:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
but we also have lines 12 and 13 where
 
02:44:38.070 --> 02:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
it requires each healthcare facility to
 
02:44:39.830 --> 02:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
post on its website the informational
 
02:44:41.590 --> 02:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
materials explaining the rights in this
 
02:44:43.670 --> 02:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
section that should include the written
 
02:44:45.830 --> 02:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
hospital policies that will lead to a
 
02:44:45.840 --> 02:44:47.910 align:start position:0%
hospital policies that will lead to a
denial

02:44:47.910 --> 02:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
denial
 
02:44:49.990 --> 02:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
there's nothing keeping them from having
 
02:44:52.710 --> 02:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
that as a booklet or pamphlet or
 
02:44:54.469 --> 02:44:54.479 align:start position:0%
something on the wall that says check
 
02:44:56.389 --> 02:44:56.399 align:start position:0%
for most recent updates but this is our
 
02:44:58.309 --> 02:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
policy and this is where you find our
 
02:45:01.349 --> 02:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
most recent visitor policy
 
02:45:01.359 --> 02:45:03.910 align:start position:0%
most recent visitor policy
this

02:45:03.910 --> 02:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:05.269 --> 02:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
we're feeling all of these hard feelings
 
02:45:07.110 --> 02:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
here in this room it's hard to be a
 
02:45:08.790 --> 02:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
healthcare professional and it's hard to
 
02:45:10.950 --> 02:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
be a patient and it's even harder to be
 
02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
a loved one that doesn't know what's
 
02:45:13.349 --> 02:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
going on
 
02:45:15.670 --> 02:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
i think that this is going to help us
 
02:45:18.150 --> 02:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
heal and i know that there are some big
 
02:45:20.950 --> 02:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
deep um divides here on how to go about
 
02:45:23.830 --> 02:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
it so if i ca may i make a motion mr
 
02:45:24.950 --> 02:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
02:45:27.510 --> 02:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
the chair realizes he's likely to be the
 
02:45:29.510 --> 02:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
casting vote the chair calls on
 
02:45:37.830 --> 02:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:40.469 --> 02:45:40.479 align:start position:0%
i would move
 
02:45:40.479 --> 02:45:42.030 align:start position:0%
i would move

02:45:49.670 --> 02:45:49.680 align:start position:0%

02:45:59.190 --> 02:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:46:01.269 --> 02:46:01.279 align:start position:0%
i did a quick
 
02:46:05.670 --> 02:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
thing silly uh i added 10 19 and 946 and
 
02:46:08.309 --> 02:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
divided by two
 
02:46:10.550 --> 02:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm not understanding what you
 
02:46:12.469 --> 02:46:12.479 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to say is i like them
 
02:46:12.479 --> 02:46:13.910 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to say is i like them

both
 
02:46:16.070 --> 02:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
and i can't get them both
 
02:46:18.790 --> 02:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
and what i'm hoping is that
 
02:46:21.590 --> 02:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
whichever amendment triumphs
 
02:46:23.269 --> 02:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
the other amendment
 
02:46:25.590 --> 02:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
will also be heard
 
02:46:28.230 --> 02:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
by the senate as they get ready to work
 
02:46:31.830 --> 02:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
on this bill should it pass the house
 
02:46:34.309 --> 02:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
there's good stuff in both
 
02:46:36.309 --> 02:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
but i have to pick one
 
02:46:38.469 --> 02:46:38.479 align:start position:0%
and i just did
 
02:46:39.670 --> 02:46:39.680 align:start position:0%

03:26:01.590 --> 03:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
executive session again
 
03:26:05.030 --> 03:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1180 which also has a

motion on the floor pending a ruling
 
03:26:11.670 --> 03:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
from the clerk of the house whether
 
03:26:13.990 --> 03:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
should the amendment pass the bill we
 
03:26:15.670 --> 03:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
would vote on
 
03:26:19.510 --> 03:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
may legally be considered the answer and
 
03:26:22.070 --> 03:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
i will let our committee assist
 
03:26:25.110 --> 03:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
researcher fourth floor denizen give the
 
03:26:38.790 --> 03:26:38.800 align:start position:0%

03:26:57.269 --> 03:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
and notwithstanding a reference to
 
03:26:59.670 --> 03:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
administration of motor vehicle laws we
 
03:27:03.190 --> 03:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
may proceed with this i trust that
 
03:27:05.349 --> 03:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
in enrolled bills they'll change any
 
03:27:08.229 --> 03:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
words that that are just ridiculous
 
03:27:10.070 --> 03:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
the motion before us moved by
 
03:27:12.309 --> 03:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
representative gay and seconded by
 
03:27:14.389 --> 03:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
representative acton

03:27:20.870 --> 03:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to make a comment about
 
03:27:22.630 --> 03:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
enrolled bills they don't
 
03:27:25.349 --> 03:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
they only correct statutory references
 
03:27:27.670 --> 03:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
they can't take out a whole
 
03:27:30.870 --> 03:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
portion of what we have passed thank you
 
03:27:32.710 --> 03:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
so if you
 
03:27:36.150 --> 03:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
are concerned as i am about
 
03:27:38.550 --> 03:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
why we are even addressing this in motor
 
03:27:40.150 --> 03:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
vehicles you should vote no on the
 
03:27:43.030 --> 03:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
amendment um and then no on the
 
03:27:44.469 --> 03:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
 
03:27:50.150 --> 03:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:51.830 --> 03:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
everything else whether you agree or
 
03:27:54.389 --> 03:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
disagree with it seems to be an order
 
03:27:56.150 --> 03:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
and again my thought is when this goes
 
03:27:57.830 --> 03:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
over to the senate should they catch
 
03:27:57.840 --> 03:27:58.710 align:start position:0%
over to the senate should they catch
this

03:27:58.710 --> 03:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:28:00.070 --> 03:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
then there will be a committee of
 
03:28:00.080 --> 03:28:02.070 align:start position:0%
then there will be a committee of
conference

03:28:02.070 --> 03:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
conference
 
03:28:03.830 --> 03:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
so the motion before us removed by
 
03:28:05.429 --> 03:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
representative gay seconded by
 
03:28:07.510 --> 03:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative acton is the amendment
 
03:28:07.520 --> 03:28:22.710 align:start position:0%
representative acton is the amendment
959

03:28:22.710 --> 03:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:25.670 --> 03:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
i also don't understand why it was
 
03:28:28.469 --> 03:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
anything in motor vehicle laws
 
03:28:30.870 --> 03:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
would it be difficult
 
03:28:33.110 --> 03:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
would it be worth waiting for to go ask
 
03:28:37.670 --> 03:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:40.150 --> 03:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
they do work quickly
 
03:28:41.910 --> 03:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
christina do you have any knowledge as
 
03:28:44.229 --> 03:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
to how this phrase managed to get into
 
03:28:44.239 --> 03:28:47.349 align:start position:0%
to how this phrase managed to get into
this

03:28:47.349 --> 03:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:49.590 --> 03:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
could you call
 
03:28:52.630 --> 03:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
there's a code here as to which lawyer
 
03:28:54.389 --> 03:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
it is and i can never figure out who's
 
03:28:54.399 --> 03:28:55.429 align:start position:0%
it is and i can never figure out who's
whom

03:28:55.429 --> 03:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
whom
 
03:28:57.429 --> 03:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
or who's who
 
03:28:57.439 --> 03:28:59.190 align:start position:0%
or who's who
okay

03:28:59.190 --> 03:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:29:01.910 --> 03:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
so we will we will do that we will find
 
03:29:04.229 --> 03:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
out why that is in there and it would be
 
03:29:06.260 --> 03:29:06.270 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
03:29:06.270 --> 03:29:07.910 align:start position:0%
in order to
[Music]

03:29:07.910 --> 03:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:29:10.630 --> 03:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
do that representative weber i'm just
 
03:29:12.389 --> 03:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
going to express a certain amount of
 
03:29:15.590 --> 03:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
frustration here and that we were given
 
03:29:18.790 --> 03:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:21.269 --> 03:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
orders from you last week to have
 
03:29:23.910 --> 03:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
everything in order for today and some
 
03:29:25.110 --> 03:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
of our
 
03:29:27.190 --> 03:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
bills are now working on their fourth or
 
03:29:30.070 --> 03:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
fifth amendments in the last two days
 
03:29:30.080 --> 03:29:31.269 align:start position:0%
fifth amendments in the last two days
and

03:29:31.269 --> 03:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:29:31.279 --> 03:29:33.269 align:start position:0%
and
uh

03:29:33.269 --> 03:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:29:36.469 --> 03:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
i'm very concerned about time for today
 
03:29:39.190 --> 03:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
i know some of us have
 
03:29:40.790 --> 03:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
time commitments
 
03:29:40.800 --> 03:29:41.750 align:start position:0%
time commitments
and

03:29:41.750 --> 03:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:29:43.990 --> 03:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
i'm also concerned about tomorrow but
 
03:29:45.830 --> 03:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
there it is well we're not going to come
 
03:29:47.349 --> 03:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
back tomorrow but i share your
 
03:29:49.429 --> 03:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
frustration and um
 
03:29:51.750 --> 03:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
i may be enabling some of the reasons
 
03:29:55.190 --> 03:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
for our frustration to which i apologize
 
03:29:56.389 --> 03:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh then
 
03:30:00.389 --> 03:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
i would i am considering taking the
 
03:30:02.950 --> 03:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
session on 1180 off
 
03:30:06.150 --> 03:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
while you're getting the answer to that
 
03:30:08.389 --> 03:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
so this closes
 
03:30:10.950 --> 03:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
the exact session on 1180 until we get
 
03:30:13.269 --> 03:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
an answer to that
 
03:30:16.950 --> 03:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
um we're waiting on your thing uh
 
03:30:21.269 --> 03:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:28.870 --> 03:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:31.830 --> 03:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
the exact session
 
03:30:35.750 --> 03:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1080 relative to the
 
03:30:38.469 --> 03:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
rights of conscience for medical
 
03:30:38.479 --> 03:30:40.790 align:start position:0%
rights of conscience for medical
professionals

03:30:40.790 --> 03:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
03:30:44.469 --> 03:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
uh there are no amendments to this
 
03:30:44.479 --> 03:30:46.150 align:start position:0%
uh there are no amendments to this
and

03:30:46.150 --> 03:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:30:49.429 --> 03:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
i call on myself since it's my bill to
 
03:30:51.910 --> 03:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
move otp
 
03:30:57.590 --> 03:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:01.030 --> 03:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much delay miss
 
03:31:04.070 --> 03:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
during the hearing you may remember um i
 
03:31:06.309 --> 03:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
brought up the question
 
03:31:09.030 --> 03:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
that there are numbers of medical
 
03:31:12.710 --> 03:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
professionals who for deeply held
 
03:31:15.110 --> 03:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
reasons of conscience
 
03:31:17.750 --> 03:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
cannot participate in
 
03:31:19.830 --> 03:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
an abortion
 
03:31:19.840 --> 03:31:21.190 align:start position:0%
an abortion
and

03:31:21.190 --> 03:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:31:24.150 --> 03:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
there were numbers of i thought very
 
03:31:27.269 --> 03:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
very helpful suggestions on ways to
 
03:31:29.269 --> 03:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
broaden this to
 
03:31:32.469 --> 03:31:32.479 align:start position:0%
beyond simply abortion
 
03:31:34.710 --> 03:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
or or and
 
03:31:37.030 --> 03:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
not just medical professionals but
 
03:31:39.030 --> 03:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
counseling professionals in other words
 
03:31:42.389 --> 03:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
turn it into a a very large bill that
 
03:31:44.389 --> 03:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
recognizes the
 
03:31:46.630 --> 03:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
rights of conscience
 
03:31:49.429 --> 03:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
in a number of people in the helping
 
03:31:49.439 --> 03:31:50.870 align:start position:0%
in a number of people in the helping
professions

03:31:50.870 --> 03:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
professions
 
03:31:52.630 --> 03:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
and i thought that was
 
03:31:55.429 --> 03:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
very very good certainly
 
03:31:57.830 --> 03:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
to me to be desired
 
03:31:59.990 --> 03:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
but at the end i felt let's deal with
 
03:32:02.070 --> 03:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
this one particular issue
 
03:32:04.150 --> 03:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
and over the summer perhaps people of
 
03:32:06.950 --> 03:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
goodwill may wish to work on a
 
03:32:09.590 --> 03:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
rights of conscience for counselors
 
03:32:11.990 --> 03:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
rights of conscience for medical
 
03:32:16.229 --> 03:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
professionals in other areas but since
 
03:32:17.910 --> 03:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
we are
 
03:32:19.830 --> 03:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
most likely to be hearing from the u.s
 
03:32:22.870 --> 03:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
supreme court on abortion rulings in the
 
03:32:24.469 --> 03:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
next months
 
03:32:26.469 --> 03:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
and the various states are dealing with
 
03:32:29.429 --> 03:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
that in one way or the other
 
03:32:31.670 --> 03:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
this is a hot button issue
 
03:32:35.030 --> 03:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
i would i would end my presentation
 
03:32:37.990 --> 03:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
by saying when massachusetts had which
 
03:32:40.229 --> 03:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
it stopped having recently but when it
 
03:32:40.239 --> 03:32:41.030 align:start position:0%
it stopped having recently but when it
had

03:32:41.030 --> 03:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
had
 
03:32:43.290 --> 03:32:43.300 align:start position:0%
very strict
 
03:32:43.300 --> 03:32:44.950 align:start position:0%
very strict
[Music]

03:32:44.950 --> 03:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:32:47.269 --> 03:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
rights of conscience
 
03:32:49.750 --> 03:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
on abortion for medical people
 
03:32:52.550 --> 03:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
it did not hurt the medical profession
 
03:32:54.150 --> 03:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
in that state they were ranked amongst
 
03:32:57.750 --> 03:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
the top as they still are lots of people
 
03:32:59.349 --> 03:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
still wanted to practice in
 
03:33:01.830 --> 03:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
massachusetts it will not in any way
 
03:33:03.590 --> 03:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
negatively impact
 
03:33:05.670 --> 03:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
people in new hampshire
 
03:33:07.910 --> 03:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
so that's the presentation of the
 
03:33:13.269 --> 03:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:15.990 --> 03:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:18.870 --> 03:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
my concern
 
03:33:20.710 --> 03:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
about the bill
 
03:33:22.389 --> 03:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:33:22.399 --> 03:33:24.150 align:start position:0%
is that
currently

03:33:24.150 --> 03:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
currently
 
03:33:27.110 --> 03:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
anybody who has a problem with their
 
03:33:30.469 --> 03:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
conscience has the right to seek
 
03:33:32.750 --> 03:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
different employment different
 
03:33:32.760 --> 03:33:34.309 align:start position:0%
different employment different
circumstances

03:33:34.309 --> 03:33:34.319 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
03:33:37.190 --> 03:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
it's not as if medical personnel for
 
03:33:39.590 --> 03:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
example aren't desperately wanted in
 
03:33:41.910 --> 03:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
every single solitary area in every
 
03:33:44.389 --> 03:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
single solitary field
 
03:33:44.399 --> 03:33:45.670 align:start position:0%
single solitary field
and

03:33:45.670 --> 03:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:33:48.309 --> 03:33:48.319 align:start position:0%
my training was that your conscience was
 
03:33:50.389 --> 03:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
something that you wrestled with you
 
03:33:50.399 --> 03:33:51.990 align:start position:0%
something that you wrestled with you
consulted

03:33:51.990 --> 03:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
consulted
 
03:33:55.110 --> 03:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
and following your conscience is not
 
03:33:57.510 --> 03:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
always easy
 
03:33:59.670 --> 03:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
and following your conscience is not
 
03:33:59.680 --> 03:34:01.910 align:start position:0%
and following your conscience is not
something

03:34:01.910 --> 03:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:34:01.920 --> 03:34:04.070 align:start position:0%
something
that

03:34:04.070 --> 03:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:34:05.830 --> 03:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:34:09.429 --> 03:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
the issue with this bill is that it
 
03:34:11.510 --> 03:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
codifies the rights
 
03:34:13.269 --> 03:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
of conscience
 
03:34:16.950 --> 03:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
of people whose conscience dictates one
 
03:34:16.960 --> 03:34:17.990 align:start position:0%
of people whose conscience dictates one
certain

certain

certain
procedure

03:34:19.750 --> 03:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
03:34:22.550 --> 03:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
and one way of proceeding
 
03:34:25.990 --> 03:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
while at the same time the rights of
 
03:34:28.389 --> 03:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
conscience of people who disagree with
 
03:34:28.399 --> 03:34:29.190 align:start position:0%
conscience of people who disagree with
them

03:34:29.190 --> 03:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:34:33.110 --> 03:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
is already made illegal so there is no
 
03:34:33.120 --> 03:34:34.710 align:start position:0%
is already made illegal so there is no
possibility

03:34:34.710 --> 03:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
03:34:36.870 --> 03:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
of medical providers
 
03:34:40.070 --> 03:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
who think that it is an appropriate and
 
03:34:43.590 --> 03:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
necessary practice for example
 
03:34:45.349 --> 03:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
to help
 
03:34:47.910 --> 03:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
people who are stuck in an impossible
 
03:34:51.750 --> 03:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
situation after 24 weeks of pregnancy
 
03:34:53.830 --> 03:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
they don't have the rights of conscience
 
03:34:56.790 --> 03:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
they're it's they are prohibited
 
03:34:59.110 --> 03:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
people currently are not prohibited from
 
03:35:00.630 --> 03:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
following their consciences in this
 
03:35:02.950 --> 03:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
direction they're just not protected for
 
03:35:02.960 --> 03:35:03.830 align:start position:0%
direction they're just not protected for
it

03:35:03.830 --> 03:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:35:06.309 --> 03:35:06.319 align:start position:0%
and i think treating different people's
 
03:35:06.319 --> 03:35:07.670 align:start position:0%
and i think treating different people's
consciences

03:35:07.670 --> 03:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
consciences
 
03:35:11.670 --> 03:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
differently in that way
 
03:35:15.590 --> 03:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:19.030 --> 03:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
i also am concerned that as written
 
03:35:20.950 --> 03:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
this could have the
 
03:35:23.190 --> 03:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
effect and i grant you it's tenuous but
 
03:35:25.830 --> 03:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
i don't see any way of preventing it
 
03:35:28.710 --> 03:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
you have somebody who gets a
 
03:35:31.990 --> 03:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
job at a reproductive health care center
 
03:35:33.830 --> 03:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
and then says oh
 
03:35:36.389 --> 03:35:36.399 align:start position:0%
i've had a crisis of conscience
 
03:35:39.110 --> 03:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
i no longer want to participate in
 
03:35:40.950 --> 03:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
abortion care
 
03:35:43.590 --> 03:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
and they get to keep their job and keep
 
03:35:45.110 --> 03:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
their pay
 
03:35:45.120 --> 03:35:45.990 align:start position:0%
their pay
and

03:35:45.990 --> 03:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:48.469 --> 03:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
not be able to be discharged even though
 
03:35:50.389 --> 03:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
they're not providing any of the core
 
03:35:53.349 --> 03:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
functions of what they were hired to do
 
03:35:56.309 --> 03:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
and i think that is reprehensible
 
03:35:56.319 --> 03:35:57.990 align:start position:0%
and i think that is reprehensible
so

03:35:57.990 --> 03:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:35:59.510 --> 03:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of other reasons but i'm
 
03:36:01.269 --> 03:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
going to stop there and say i'm voting
 
03:36:03.670 --> 03:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
against this bill let me speak to the
 
03:36:07.190 --> 03:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
three that you did mention
 
03:36:07.200 --> 03:36:08.870 align:start position:0%
three that you did mention
increasingly

03:36:08.870 --> 03:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
increasingly
 
03:36:11.670 --> 03:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
doctors do not have standalone practices
 
03:36:13.990 --> 03:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
the one i supervise is a dinosaur we
 
03:36:16.550 --> 03:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
have three pcps and we are an entity to
 
03:36:16.560 --> 03:36:17.830 align:start position:0%
have three pcps and we are an entity to
ourselves

03:36:17.830 --> 03:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
03:36:19.349 --> 03:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
most people coming out of medical
 
03:36:22.710 --> 03:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
schools have to work for chains now with
 
03:36:24.469 --> 03:36:24.479 align:start position:0%
numbers and numbers and numbers of
 
03:36:24.479 --> 03:36:25.830 align:start position:0%
numbers and numbers and numbers of
doctors

03:36:25.830 --> 03:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
doctors
 
03:36:25.840 --> 03:36:27.030 align:start position:0%
doctors
and

03:36:27.030 --> 03:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:36:30.550 --> 03:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
we have heard testimony and we have done
 
03:36:34.870 --> 03:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
our investigation to see that um
 
03:36:37.110 --> 03:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
many of these would not hire
 
03:36:39.110 --> 03:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
somebody with an objection to abortion
 
03:36:42.070 --> 03:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
so the job market
 
03:36:44.229 --> 03:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
may be limited this would say to those
 
03:36:46.070 --> 03:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
people if you have many doctors on your
 
03:36:48.870 --> 03:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
staff you can do workarounds as i know
 
03:36:51.429 --> 03:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
some jobs do to give jewish people
 
03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
friday night and saturday often
 
03:36:54.229 --> 03:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
christian people sunday off there's
 
03:36:56.309 --> 03:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
workarounds and
 
03:36:58.790 --> 03:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
secondly um this bill does not seek to
 
03:37:01.269 --> 03:37:01.279 align:start position:0%
address one way or the other the
 
03:37:03.910 --> 03:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
abortion rules put in place by house
 
03:37:07.030 --> 03:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
bill second two that's their thing
 
03:37:09.510 --> 03:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's another bill this is dealing with
 
03:37:11.510 --> 03:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
certain things it's not dealing with
 
03:37:14.630 --> 03:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
other people other rights other jobs
 
03:37:17.030 --> 03:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
and then thirdly um
 
03:37:19.750 --> 03:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
i've never met anybody and and i am
 
03:37:21.670 --> 03:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
quite active in the pro-life movement i
 
03:37:23.510 --> 03:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
have never met anybody
 
03:37:25.750 --> 03:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
who when conscience
 
03:37:28.790 --> 03:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
suddenly um has not suddenly but
 
03:37:32.389 --> 03:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
conscience now changes and one is
 
03:37:35.190 --> 03:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
anti-abortion while working at a place
 
03:37:37.349 --> 03:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
that does abortions who stays there they
 
03:37:40.070 --> 03:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
voluntarily leave i have never heard of
 
03:37:42.469 --> 03:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
anybody who has stayed and then started
 
03:37:45.349 --> 03:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
to demand rights finally this language
 
03:37:45.359 --> 03:37:46.630 align:start position:0%
to demand rights finally this language
is

03:37:46.630 --> 03:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:37:49.670 --> 03:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
obviously way smarter than i am and has
 
03:37:51.429 --> 03:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
been put
 
03:37:53.590 --> 03:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
into legislation in some states and is
 
03:37:55.110 --> 03:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
trying to be in some others
 
03:37:58.630 --> 03:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
03:38:01.349 --> 03:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um
 
03:38:03.269 --> 03:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
i understand that many medical
 
03:38:05.269 --> 03:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
facilities there are
 
03:38:07.670 --> 03:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
or many of them are large and there are
 
03:38:09.670 --> 03:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
various functions and people could find
 
03:38:12.389 --> 03:38:12.399 align:start position:0%
other positions but
 
03:38:15.349 --> 03:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
in an agency such as planned parenthood
 
03:38:17.510 --> 03:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
which has a limited scope
 
03:38:20.630 --> 03:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
if someone decided
 
03:38:23.110 --> 03:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
by conscience or whatever that they were
 
03:38:25.590 --> 03:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
no willing no longer willing to deal
 
03:38:25.600 --> 03:38:27.030 align:start position:0%
no willing no longer willing to deal
with

03:38:27.030 --> 03:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:38:28.870 --> 03:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
even take abortion out of the equation
 
03:38:31.990 --> 03:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
but contraceptives
 
03:38:34.630 --> 03:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
my understanding of this bill is that if
 
03:38:36.710 --> 03:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
they chose to and i don't know why they
 
03:38:39.510 --> 03:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
would chose choose to accept to be
 
03:38:39.520 --> 03:38:41.670 align:start position:0%
would chose choose to accept to be
obstructionist

03:38:41.670 --> 03:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
obstructionist
 
03:38:43.830 --> 03:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
that it would be illegal for planned
 
03:38:47.750 --> 03:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:49.510 --> 03:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
move this person along say that they
 
03:38:51.189 --> 03:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't work there anymore have a
 
03:38:53.349 --> 03:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
amicable parting
 
03:38:53.359 --> 03:38:55.510 align:start position:0%
amicable parting
and

03:38:55.510 --> 03:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:38:58.150 --> 03:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
that just to me seems to defy common
 
03:38:58.160 --> 03:38:59.269 align:start position:0%
that just to me seems to defy common
sense

03:38:59.269 --> 03:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
sense
 
03:39:01.670 --> 03:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
as well as being
 
03:39:04.389 --> 03:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
contrary to protecting
 
03:39:04.399 --> 03:39:06.070 align:start position:0%
contrary to protecting
businesses

03:39:06.070 --> 03:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
03:39:07.590 --> 03:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood isn't literally a
 
03:39:10.790 --> 03:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
business but there are a organization
 
03:39:12.550 --> 03:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:39:14.550 --> 03:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't have any problem with the
 
03:39:14.560 --> 03:39:15.429 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't have any problem with the
part

03:39:15.429 --> 03:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
part
 
03:39:17.910 --> 03:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
of this bill which i believe addresses
 
03:39:17.920 --> 03:39:20.950 align:start position:0%
of this bill which i believe addresses
um

03:39:20.950 --> 03:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:23.269 --> 03:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
not allowing for consequences at a
 
03:39:25.269 --> 03:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
medical board or any kind of board of
 
03:39:25.279 --> 03:39:26.630 align:start position:0%
medical board or any kind of board of
practice

03:39:26.630 --> 03:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
practice
 
03:39:29.349 --> 03:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
but the part about employment
 
03:39:32.309 --> 03:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
um protecting the person from protecting
 
03:39:32.319 --> 03:39:33.590 align:start position:0%
um protecting the person from protecting
the

03:39:33.590 --> 03:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:39:36.070 --> 03:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
person from being let go of employment
 
03:39:37.990 --> 03:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
um just
 
03:39:40.150 --> 03:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
defies logic to me i just don't
 
03:39:42.790 --> 03:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
understand how we could do that
 
03:39:44.309 --> 03:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
there's no evidence that this has ever
 
03:39:44.319 --> 03:39:45.510 align:start position:0%
there's no evidence that this has ever
happened

03:39:45.510 --> 03:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
happened
 
03:39:48.070 --> 03:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
well there is no evidence that anybody
 
03:39:50.469 --> 03:39:50.479 align:start position:0%
who's worked in a facility like that has
 
03:39:53.510 --> 03:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
suddenly decided to stay and be a jerk
 
03:39:55.189 --> 03:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro as you pointed
 
03:39:59.110 --> 03:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
out earlier today we often do things
 
03:40:01.670 --> 03:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
ahead of time so that
 
03:40:04.630 --> 03:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
to head off problems um i appreciate
 
03:40:06.790 --> 03:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
this is just you know this is just a
 
03:40:09.269 --> 03:40:09.279 align:start position:0%
potential problem
 
03:40:10.790 --> 03:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:40:12.630 --> 03:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:40:14.790 --> 03:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
this is the kind of bill that uh we
 
03:40:15.830 --> 03:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
could either
 
03:40:18.229 --> 03:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
just start voting on or we could talk
 
03:40:20.710 --> 03:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
for about the next six months and
 
03:40:23.510 --> 03:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know i i don't want to say you can't
 
03:40:25.110 --> 03:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
speak but i'm just going to suggest
 
03:40:25.120 --> 03:40:25.990 align:start position:0%
speak but i'm just going to suggest
we've

03:40:25.990 --> 03:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
we've
 
03:40:27.990 --> 03:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
we've really spoken on
 
03:40:30.469 --> 03:40:30.479 align:start position:0%
this issue a lot and
 
03:40:32.309 --> 03:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
my encouragement as we move to a vote
 
03:40:33.830 --> 03:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
but if somebody wishes to speak
 
03:40:36.469 --> 03:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
representative woods please do so uh yes
 
03:40:38.950 --> 03:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
i just from the physicians perspective
 
03:40:41.110 --> 03:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
and the pa's perspective since they're
 
03:40:43.030 --> 03:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
both under the aegis of the board of
 
03:40:43.040 --> 03:40:44.630 align:start position:0%
both under the aegis of the board of
medicine

03:40:44.630 --> 03:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
03:40:44.640 --> 03:40:45.670 align:start position:0%
medicine
the

03:40:45.670 --> 03:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:40:45.680 --> 03:40:47.590 align:start position:0%
the
nrsa

03:40:47.590 --> 03:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
nrsa
 
03:40:49.830 --> 03:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
physicians have to meet the standard of
 
03:40:51.510 --> 03:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
the american code of
 
03:40:52.950 --> 03:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
medical ethics
 
03:40:55.910 --> 03:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
in there it states very specifically
 
03:40:57.830 --> 03:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh this very issue and i won't go into
 
03:40:59.110 --> 03:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
all the details and read you the
 
03:40:59.120 --> 03:41:00.630 align:start position:0%
all the details and read you the
legalese

03:41:00.630 --> 03:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
legalese
 
03:41:02.389 --> 03:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
but indeed
 
03:41:04.790 --> 03:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
the physician well i'll just say a
 
03:41:07.269 --> 03:41:07.279 align:start position:0%
physician may decline to establish a
 
03:41:09.189 --> 03:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
patient physician relationship with a
 
03:41:11.110 --> 03:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
prospective patient or provide specific
 
03:41:13.269 --> 03:41:13.279 align:start position:0%
care to an existing patient certain
 
03:41:15.750 --> 03:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
limited circumstances and in there it
 
03:41:18.630 --> 03:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
talks about just this issue of the
 
03:41:18.640 --> 03:41:20.469 align:start position:0%
talks about just this issue of the
conscious

03:41:20.469 --> 03:41:20.479 align:start position:0%
conscious
 
03:41:20.479 --> 03:41:21.429 align:start position:0%
conscious
decline

03:41:21.429 --> 03:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
decline
 
03:41:23.750 --> 03:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
and so from that perspective and i can't
 
03:41:25.510 --> 03:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
speak for nurses i can't speak for other
 
03:41:25.520 --> 03:41:26.870 align:start position:0%
speak for nurses i can't speak for other
providers

03:41:26.870 --> 03:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
providers
 
03:41:28.950 --> 03:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
but under the board of medicine
 
03:41:31.670 --> 03:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
the physicians and the pas are have to
 
03:41:34.070 --> 03:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
meet that standard which includes
 
03:41:36.710 --> 03:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
as a backup you know this ethical
 
03:41:39.189 --> 03:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
standard and the and the role of the
 
03:41:44.150 --> 03:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:46.950 --> 03:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
what if the facility let's say a large
 
03:41:49.830 --> 03:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
doc in the box with 15
 
03:41:49.840 --> 03:41:51.670 align:start position:0%
doc in the box with 15
providers

03:41:51.670 --> 03:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
providers
 
03:41:55.030 --> 03:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
were to put pressure on a physician
 
03:41:57.590 --> 03:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
to participate to assist in
 
03:42:00.150 --> 03:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh that that has happened uh and i can't
 
03:42:01.510 --> 03:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
tell you the outcome but it did go to
 
03:42:01.520 --> 03:42:02.309 align:start position:0%
tell you the outcome but it did go to
court

03:42:02.309 --> 03:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
court
 
03:42:05.030 --> 03:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh and it varies from state to state uh
 
03:42:06.870 --> 03:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
i think there's only
 
03:42:09.510 --> 03:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
i'll say three there may be more but
 
03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
three that i know of
 
03:42:14.070 --> 03:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
that have the ama guides as
 
03:42:17.030 --> 03:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's the standard that's being used
 
03:42:18.389 --> 03:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
and so i don't know about the other
 
03:42:20.389 --> 03:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
states they don't have that to fall back
 
03:42:22.790 --> 03:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
on so i can't i can't
 
03:42:24.469 --> 03:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
really answer your question
 
03:42:30.070 --> 03:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:32.630 --> 03:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
seeing no further hands then the
 
03:42:34.950 --> 03:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
question before us
 
03:42:37.510 --> 03:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
is house bill 1080 the rights of
 
03:42:37.520 --> 03:42:38.870 align:start position:0%

new
 
03:48:08.309 --> 03:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
and final version of amendment
 
03:48:09.910 --> 03:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
brings to the table
 
03:48:11.830 --> 03:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:48:13.990 --> 03:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
we had great discussion about how rights
 
03:48:15.750 --> 03:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
and responsibilities aren't much unless
 
03:48:17.349 --> 03:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
you know about them
 
03:48:17.359 --> 03:48:18.229 align:start position:0%
you know about them
this

03:48:18.229 --> 03:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:48:19.910 --> 03:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
adds that the patient bill of rights
 
03:48:21.910 --> 03:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be available on the facility
 
03:48:24.710 --> 03:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
website and on the wall and the hospital
 
03:48:26.870 --> 03:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
visitation policy detailing the rights
 
03:48:28.630 --> 03:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
and responsibilities created by the
 
03:48:30.790 --> 03:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
section and the limitations placed on
 
03:48:33.269 --> 03:48:33.279 align:start position:0%
those rights by written hospital policy
 
03:48:34.870 --> 03:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
to be available on the website and in
 
03:48:35.830 --> 03:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
the rooms
 
03:48:38.550 --> 03:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
that way it that way any of the policies
 
03:48:40.229 --> 03:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
that are limiting them aren't a surprise
 
03:48:41.910 --> 03:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
to people in the facility or before they
 
03:48:44.469 --> 03:48:44.479 align:start position:0%
enter them that way the responsibility
 
03:48:44.479 --> 03:48:45.510 align:start position:0%
enter them that way the responsibility
to

03:48:45.510 --> 03:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:48:45.520 --> 03:48:46.309 align:start position:0%
to
not

03:48:46.309 --> 03:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:48:46.319 --> 03:48:48.070 align:start position:0%
not
be

03:48:48.070 --> 03:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:48:49.830 --> 03:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
not interfere with other patients and
 
03:48:52.070 --> 03:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
not be disruptive or threatening is also
 
03:48:54.790 --> 03:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
clear to the patient and their visitors
 
03:48:57.110 --> 03:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
the motive or the impetus to this as i
 
03:48:59.910 --> 03:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
recall was a recalcitrant member of your
 
03:49:02.870 --> 03:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
very caucus who wanted the thing on the
 
03:49:06.229 --> 03:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
wall and uh dug in his heels accordingly
 
03:49:09.110 --> 03:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
and over a nice lunch uh this amendment
 
03:49:11.670 --> 03:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
seems to mollify him would you agree i
 
03:49:13.189 --> 03:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
sure would hope so
 
03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:49:17.830 --> 03:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
03:49:19.670 --> 03:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
and for all the reasons that have been
 
03:49:19.680 --> 03:49:21.590 align:start position:0%
and for all the reasons that have been
discussed

03:49:21.590 --> 03:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
03:49:25.510 --> 03:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
again and again and again it fails to
 
03:49:28.229 --> 03:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
satisfy any of the concerns that were
 
03:49:30.550 --> 03:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
raised with any of the previous layout
 
03:49:32.710 --> 03:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
amendments so
 
03:49:34.950 --> 03:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
i will be voting against i i will be
 
03:49:37.830 --> 03:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
voting for ought to pass as amended with
 
03:49:39.590 --> 03:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
the weber amendment which is the actual
 
03:49:42.070 --> 03:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
motion which is in front of us it is
 
03:49:42.080 --> 03:49:42.950 align:start position:0%
motion which is in front of us it is

03:49:42.950 --> 03:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:49:47.030 --> 03:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
should that fail because i can count
 
03:49:49.830 --> 03:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
i will be voting against this amendment

i don't see any reason for rehashing all
 
03:49:55.670 --> 03:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
of that because nothing's going to
 
03:49:55.680 --> 03:49:56.710 align:start position:0%

03:56:42.070 --> 03:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty sure it's going to be the one
 
03:56:43.269 --> 03:56:43.279 align:start position:0%
with my
 
03:56:45.670 --> 03:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
minority amendment but
 
03:56:45.680 --> 03:56:47.830 align:start position:0%
minority amendment but
okay

03:56:47.830 --> 03:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:56:49.110 --> 03:56:49.120 align:start position:0%

1180
 
03:56:52.630 --> 03:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
mark were you going to do
 
03:56:54.229 --> 03:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
chair were you going to do that
 
03:56:56.550 --> 03:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
confusion about this other amendment
 
03:56:56.560 --> 03:56:57.670 align:start position:0%
confusion about this other amendment
um

03:56:57.670 --> 03:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:58.950 --> 03:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
no but i thought if you wanted to have
 
03:57:00.630 --> 03:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
any time to deal with it we need to get
 
03:57:01.910 --> 03:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
that done so that we could have time to
 
03:57:01.920 --> 03:57:03.189 align:start position:0%
that done so that we could have time to
deal

03:57:03.189 --> 03:57:03.199 align:start position:0%
deal
 
03:57:07.910 --> 03:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:07.920 --> 03:57:14.870 align:start position:0%
 
1180

03:57:14.870 --> 03:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:17.590 --> 03:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
open the executive session or continue
 
03:57:20.070 --> 03:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
it on house bill 1180 and the chair
 
03:57:23.269 --> 03:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative leon who
 
03:57:25.750 --> 03:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
will inform us about line eight to the
 
03:57:28.229 --> 03:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
amendment why it talks about motor
 
03:57:29.910 --> 03:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle laws
 
03:57:32.870 --> 03:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman the motor vehicle
 
03:57:35.269 --> 03:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
laws are long and involved and the
 
03:57:37.349 --> 03:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
details of them are a bit hard to tease
 
03:57:39.830 --> 03:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
out however the manchester school board
 
03:57:42.710 --> 03:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
policy cited the motor vehicle laws and
 
03:57:45.269 --> 03:57:45.279 align:start position:0%
that is one of the places where
 
03:57:47.269 --> 03:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
gender and sex are recognized by the
 
03:57:49.590 --> 03:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
state and when it speaks to whether or
 
03:57:51.269 --> 03:57:51.279 align:start position:0%
not the state
 
03:57:53.510 --> 03:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
is differentiating
 
03:57:55.030 --> 03:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to be in those areas
 
03:57:56.309 --> 03:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
where the state does in fact
 
03:57:56.319 --> 03:57:58.710 align:start position:0%
where the state does in fact
differentiate

03:57:58.710 --> 03:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
differentiate
 
03:58:00.790 --> 03:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
so the inference would be in spite of it
 
03:58:03.110 --> 03:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
sounding very contra intuitive there's a
 
03:58:06.070 --> 03:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
reason why they build drafter lawyer put
 
03:58:08.950 --> 03:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
it in there yes and because when we look
 
03:58:10.870 --> 03:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
to other states like florida they've
 
03:58:13.910 --> 03:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
determined that your biological sex is
 
03:58:15.590 --> 03:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
whatever the state declares you what you
 
03:58:18.070 --> 03:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
declares you are so it would be the
 
03:58:19.750 --> 03:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
florida determined that whatever's on
 
03:58:22.150 --> 03:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
your driver's license is your biological
 
03:58:22.160 --> 03:58:23.429 align:start position:0%
your driver's license is your biological
sex

03:58:23.429 --> 03:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
sex
 
03:58:25.189 --> 03:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
which is great for some things not so
 
03:58:26.870 --> 03:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
great for looking at
 
03:58:28.309 --> 03:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
risks of different medical therapies and
 
03:58:31.990 --> 03:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing so the recognition
 
03:58:33.750 --> 03:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
the recognition has
 
03:58:36.070 --> 03:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
in general has has broader applications
 
03:58:38.229 --> 03:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
but we're only looking here to athletic
 
03:58:39.830 --> 03:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
competitions that has nothing to do with
 
03:58:41.510 --> 03:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
hormone therapy or anything else that's
 
03:58:44.790 --> 03:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
very important as well
 
03:58:46.710 --> 03:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification we
 
03:58:48.950 --> 03:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
actually have a motion on the floor for
 
03:58:51.189 --> 03:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
this amendment moved by representative
 
03:58:54.309 --> 03:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
gay and seconded by representative acton
 
03:58:56.790 --> 03:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
and we can continue to have any
 
03:58:56.800 --> 03:59:01.110 align:start position:0%
and we can continue to have any
discussion

03:59:01.110 --> 03:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:09.349 --> 03:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:10.790 --> 03:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion earlier today
 
03:59:13.189 --> 03:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
that this amendment also dealt with some
 
03:59:15.349 --> 03:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
of the concerns raised by the department
 
03:59:17.670 --> 03:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
of corrections but i don't see anything
 
03:59:19.189 --> 03:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
in the amendment about that the
 
03:59:21.670 --> 03:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
amendment removes anything to do with
 
03:59:23.349 --> 03:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
the department of correction for the
 
03:59:25.750 --> 03:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
very reason of their testifying
 
03:59:27.510 --> 03:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
that is now out of the bell should the
 
03:59:30.389 --> 03:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:32.150 --> 03:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
okay i guess i didn't interest
 
03:59:35.830 --> 03:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
it is done because of their concerns
 
03:59:37.590 --> 03:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
so we acknowledged that in this
 
03:59:39.910 --> 03:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
amendment in this amendment i didn't see
 
03:59:43.590 --> 03:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:43.600 --> 03:59:44.950 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:59:44.950 --> 03:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:59:47.510 --> 03:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
weber give it a shot uh
 
03:59:50.150 --> 03:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
you don't see it in here because it was
 
03:59:52.710 --> 03:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
in the original bill
 
03:59:55.590 --> 03:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
and this amendment replaces everything
 
03:59:57.510 --> 03:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
in the original bill
 
03:59:57.520 --> 03:59:58.309 align:start position:0%
in the original bill
so

03:59:58.309 --> 03:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:00:01.349 --> 04:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
it's taken out anything in the bill
 
04:00:07.269 --> 04:00:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:07.279 --> 04:00:10.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:00:10.229 --> 04:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:11.910 --> 04:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
you may
 
04:00:13.750 --> 04:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
and and that's why
 
04:00:17.030 --> 04:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
because it solves issues for the
 
04:00:19.349 --> 04:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
department of corrections and for people
 
04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
the public accommodation bit the the
 
04:00:24.469 --> 04:00:24.479 align:start position:0%
very squishy language about places of
 
04:00:26.469 --> 04:00:26.479 align:start position:0%
personal privacy
 
04:00:28.950 --> 04:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
kevin only knows what that means
 
04:00:31.269 --> 04:00:31.279 align:start position:0%
i will vote for the amendment because it
 
04:00:34.550 --> 04:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
solves some of the problem but not for
 
04:00:36.469 --> 04:00:36.479 align:start position:0%
the bill because it retains a huge
 
04:00:38.550 --> 04:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
amount of the problem with respect
 
04:00:38.560 --> 04:00:39.429 align:start position:0%
amount of the problem with respect
to

04:00:39.429 --> 04:00:39.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:00:39.439 --> 04:00:40.710 align:start position:0%
to
athletics

04:00:40.710 --> 04:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
athletics
 
04:00:43.750 --> 04:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
which in my opinion i agree with those
 
04:00:45.510 --> 04:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
who've spoken before who think that's
 
04:00:46.790 --> 04:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
best left
 
04:00:48.710 --> 04:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
to the policy
 
04:00:50.710 --> 04:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
making bodies for
 
04:00:50.720 --> 04:00:55.189 align:start position:0%
making bodies for
athletics

04:00:55.189 --> 04:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:56.790 --> 04:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
is it not true however that the
 
04:00:59.269 --> 04:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
amendment does not make that policy it
 
04:00:59.279 --> 04:01:00.550 align:start position:0%
amendment does not make that policy it
allows

04:01:00.550 --> 04:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
allows
 
04:01:00.560 --> 04:01:01.510 align:start position:0%
allows
local

04:01:01.510 --> 04:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:01:03.590 --> 04:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
areas to have a different policy if they
 
04:01:03.600 --> 04:01:11.349 align:start position:0%
areas to have a different policy if they
choose

04:01:11.349 --> 04:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:17.349 --> 04:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:20.790 --> 04:01:20.800 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is
 
04:01:24.870 --> 04:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:26.229 --> 04:01:26.239 align:start position:0%

04:01:30.070 --> 04:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
moved by representative
 
04:01:32.469 --> 04:01:32.479 align:start position:0%

04:02:06.550 --> 04:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
you can take a minute
 
04:02:11.990 --> 04:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
for the clerk's benefit
 
04:02:12.830 --> 04:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
you may
 
04:02:15.429 --> 04:02:15.439 align:start position:0%
speak so the
 
04:02:16.950 --> 04:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to wrap my head around
 
04:02:19.590 --> 04:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
is i i recognize that we want to make
 
04:02:21.030 --> 04:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
sure that we can differentiate but the
 
04:02:23.189 --> 04:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
question is with this amendment are we
 
04:02:25.030 --> 04:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
saying we can only differentiate for
 
04:02:26.710 --> 04:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
athletic competitions
 
04:02:29.189 --> 04:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm really torn up about that
 
04:02:29.199 --> 04:02:30.389 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm really torn up about that
because

04:02:30.389 --> 04:02:30.399 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:02:31.750 --> 04:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
if we're saying that that's the only
 
04:02:34.389 --> 04:02:34.399 align:start position:0%
time you can differentiate i sat in on a
 
04:02:36.389 --> 04:02:36.399 align:start position:0%
data subcommittee on the council for
 
04:02:38.389 --> 04:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
suicide prevention and when they were
 
04:02:40.070 --> 04:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
looking at it and trying to do the death
 
04:02:42.469 --> 04:02:42.479 align:start position:0%
records for suicide reports a lot of
 
04:02:44.150 --> 04:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
times they say unknown because they
 
04:02:45.429 --> 04:02:45.439 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
04:02:45.439 --> 04:02:46.389 align:start position:0%
don't know
and

04:02:46.389 --> 04:02:46.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's data on transgender
 
04:02:52.150 --> 04:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
suicide and suicidal ideation is
 
04:02:53.830 --> 04:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely terrible because we don't ask
 
04:02:55.349 --> 04:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
those questions and we don't have a way
 
04:02:56.710 --> 04:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
to answer that
 
04:02:58.469 --> 04:02:58.479 align:start position:0%
i would love to have data that says new
 
04:02:59.990 --> 04:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire is better than the rest of the
 
04:03:01.429 --> 04:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
country on this
 
04:03:02.950 --> 04:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
but if we're worse than it we need to
 
04:03:04.389 --> 04:03:04.399 align:start position:0%
know that too
 
04:03:07.349 --> 04:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
and i'm afraid that by saying that it
 
04:03:07.359 --> 04:03:09.670 align:start position:0%
and i'm afraid that by saying that it
only

04:03:09.670 --> 04:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
only
 
04:03:11.349 --> 04:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
specifying that it's this case an
 
04:03:13.990 --> 04:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
athletic competition that it then does
 
04:03:15.429 --> 04:03:15.439 align:start position:0%
away with the opportunity to
 
04:03:17.030 --> 04:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
differentiate in other areas that are
 
04:03:20.309 --> 04:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
really important because
 
04:03:22.469 --> 04:03:22.479 align:start position:0%
transitioning is a medical process and
 
04:03:24.389 --> 04:03:24.399 align:start position:0%
the medical issues that come with it are
 
04:03:24.399 --> 04:03:25.670 align:start position:0%
the medical issues that come with it are
important

04:03:25.670 --> 04:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:03:28.790 --> 04:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to
 
04:03:30.469 --> 04:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
i don't want to cause more problems with
 
04:03:32.469 --> 04:03:32.479 align:start position:0%
this than we solve
 
04:03:34.550 --> 04:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
because this is this is a really
 
04:03:36.150 --> 04:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
challenging issue
 
04:03:38.150 --> 04:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
and i respect the girls who lose their
 
04:03:41.189 --> 04:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
scholarships and i respect the fact that
 
04:03:41.199 --> 04:03:42.710 align:start position:0%
scholarships and i respect the fact that
that

04:03:42.710 --> 04:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:03:44.469 --> 04:03:44.479 align:start position:0%
that on some things data matters and we
 
04:03:46.550 --> 04:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
need to be able to to identify
 
04:03:49.269 --> 04:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
differentiate and i respect that we have
 
04:03:51.349 --> 04:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
young women that dominate on the
 
04:03:54.150 --> 04:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
wrestling mats too and in jiu jitsu
 
04:03:55.830 --> 04:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
especially in these grappling sports
 
04:03:57.990 --> 04:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
where it's not just strength it's also
 
04:03:58.000 --> 04:03:59.510 align:start position:0%
where it's not just strength it's also
finesse

04:03:59.510 --> 04:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
finesse
 
04:04:02.389 --> 04:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:03.990 --> 04:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just worried that this narrows it
 
04:04:04.000 --> 04:04:04.830 align:start position:0%
i'm just worried that this narrows it
too

04:04:04.830 --> 04:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
too
 
04:04:08.070 --> 04:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
much do you believe the original bill
 
04:04:08.080 --> 04:04:09.670 align:start position:0%
much do you believe the original bill
unamended

04:04:09.670 --> 04:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
unamended
 
04:04:13.110 --> 04:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to the concerns
 
04:04:16.229 --> 04:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
in part for data that you raise
 
04:04:18.870 --> 04:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
um i do think that it would be
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
helpful um the i don't
 
04:04:24.389 --> 04:04:24.399 align:start position:0%
actually with our right of personal
 
04:04:26.870 --> 04:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
privacy and article 2b
 
04:04:29.429 --> 04:04:29.439 align:start position:0%
i'd call my privacy in intimate space so
 
04:04:31.590 --> 04:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a reason to to respect
 
04:04:32.870 --> 04:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
that there
 
04:04:36.070 --> 04:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
i think that the original bill
 
04:04:38.150 --> 04:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
goes further to it because it draws more
 
04:04:40.630 --> 04:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
more areas and not just just athletic
 
04:04:40.640 --> 04:04:42.309 align:start position:0%
more areas and not just just athletic
competition

04:04:42.309 --> 04:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
competition
 
04:04:43.910 --> 04:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
so i think that i think there's less of
 
04:04:46.550 --> 04:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
a risk with the bill as introduced than
 
04:04:49.670 --> 04:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
there is with it if we amend it this way
 
04:04:51.429 --> 04:04:51.439 align:start position:0%
in terms of the
 
04:04:54.309 --> 04:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
conversations i had with rockingham
 
04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
county jail and the documents that were
 
04:04:59.189 --> 04:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
produced from others
 
04:05:01.110 --> 04:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
in the original bill when it talks about
 
04:05:01.120 --> 04:05:02.429 align:start position:0%
in the original bill when it talks about
criminal

04:05:02.429 --> 04:05:02.439 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
04:05:02.439 --> 04:05:04.389 align:start position:0%
criminal
incarceration

04:05:04.389 --> 04:05:04.399 align:start position:0%
incarceration
 
04:05:07.189 --> 04:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mandate anything it just says
 
04:05:09.189 --> 04:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
that nothing is prohibited
 
04:05:10.469 --> 04:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
so if they want to keep doing what
 
04:05:11.750 --> 04:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
they're doing they can keep doing what
 
04:05:14.150 --> 04:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
they're doing this doesn't say they
 
04:05:16.229 --> 04:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
can't in my reading of it unless i'm
 
04:05:19.910 --> 04:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:22.150 --> 04:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative leon so in some other
 
04:05:24.710 --> 04:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
states they've they've held that because
 
04:05:26.389 --> 04:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
one area was carved out and the other
 
04:05:28.790 --> 04:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't that that meant the legislature
 
04:05:31.349 --> 04:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
only intended the carve out
 
04:05:34.309 --> 04:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
okay representative canark
 
04:05:37.030 --> 04:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
yes i'd like to reflect upon the
 
04:05:38.950 --> 04:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
data that representative leon brought up
 
04:05:40.710 --> 04:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
about suicide
 
04:05:43.750 --> 04:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
it is true that transgender
 
04:05:45.670 --> 04:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
individuals do have a higher rate of
 
04:05:45.680 --> 04:05:46.950 align:start position:0%
individuals do have a higher rate of
suicide

04:05:46.950 --> 04:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
04:05:48.950 --> 04:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
but it's far higher and
 
04:05:50.469 --> 04:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
those who are not
 
04:05:53.269 --> 04:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
affirmed those who face constant
 
04:05:53.279 --> 04:05:55.429 align:start position:0%
affirmed those who face constant
discrimination

04:05:55.429 --> 04:05:55.439 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
04:05:57.349 --> 04:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
because they have gender dysphoria which
 
04:05:58.710 --> 04:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
means they don't feel comfortable with
 
04:06:01.590 --> 04:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
their current identity
 
04:06:04.790 --> 04:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
you exacerbate that when you
 
04:06:07.269 --> 04:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
continue to discriminate against them so
 
04:06:09.030 --> 04:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
if they are
 
04:06:11.349 --> 04:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
feeling gendered as a female and that is
 
04:06:14.070 --> 04:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
a persistent and consistent identity not
 
04:06:15.830 --> 04:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
just that day
 
04:06:18.229 --> 04:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
but you tell them they cannot
 
04:06:20.469 --> 04:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
go into a female restroom and they must
 
04:06:23.030 --> 04:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
go into a male restroom
 
04:06:25.269 --> 04:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
that will increase their rate of suicide
 
04:06:27.189 --> 04:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
and that's that's well documented around
 
04:06:29.110 --> 04:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
the country so even if we don't have
 
04:06:30.389 --> 04:06:30.399 align:start position:0%
great little numbers in new hampshire
 
04:06:31.590 --> 04:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
there's not a whole lot of reason to
 
04:06:32.710 --> 04:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
believe that we're going to be any
 
04:06:34.309 --> 04:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
different than any other part of the
 
04:06:34.319 --> 04:06:37.269 align:start position:0%
different than any other part of the
country

04:06:37.269 --> 04:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:39.269 --> 04:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
 
04:06:41.110 --> 04:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
chairman when you look to the data
 
04:06:41.120 --> 04:06:42.469 align:start position:0%
chairman when you look to the data
internationally

04:06:42.469 --> 04:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
internationally
 
04:06:45.429 --> 04:06:45.439 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the suicide rates in
 
04:06:48.469 --> 04:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
in thailand where it's a very accepted
 
04:06:51.349 --> 04:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
lifestyle and also in sweden where
 
04:06:53.830 --> 04:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
there's not the stigma that we see here
 
04:06:55.990 --> 04:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
that we still see here the rates are
 
04:06:57.830 --> 04:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
still very similar
 
04:06:59.990 --> 04:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it seems that
 
04:07:02.469 --> 04:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
that the stigma is one portion of it but
 
04:07:05.990 --> 04:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's not the it's not the only part
 
04:07:07.590 --> 04:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
the question
 
04:07:10.229 --> 04:07:10.239 align:start position:0%
it's not the only part of it
 
04:07:11.910 --> 04:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
you may respond
 
04:07:14.150 --> 04:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
to i don't i think it's very
 
04:07:15.830 --> 04:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
disingenuous to compare different
 
04:07:17.030 --> 04:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
countries because there's going to be
 
04:07:19.030 --> 04:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
differences all together what you look
 
04:07:21.590 --> 04:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
at is in this country
 
04:07:23.269 --> 04:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
same setup
 
04:07:25.349 --> 04:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
those who have had their gender
 
04:07:28.389 --> 04:07:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh questions affirmed versus those who
 
04:07:30.469 --> 04:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
continue to face discrimination
 
04:07:32.229 --> 04:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
for example at one point a couple of
 
04:07:34.469 --> 04:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
years ago we were the number was cited
 
04:07:34.479 --> 04:07:35.830 align:start position:0%
years ago we were the number was cited
that

04:07:35.830 --> 04:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:07:37.269 --> 04:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
transgender people who had undergone
 
04:07:38.630 --> 04:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
gender affirming surgery at a higher
 
04:07:40.149 --> 04:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
rate of suicide therefore that was a
 
04:07:41.510 --> 04:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
problem well there was a higher rate of
 
04:07:44.389 --> 04:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
suicide compared to normal controls but
 
04:07:46.309 --> 04:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
it was still lower than those who had
 
04:07:46.319 --> 04:07:47.189 align:start position:0%
it was still lower than those who had
not

04:07:47.189 --> 04:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:07:49.110 --> 04:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
had gender affirming surgery one has to
 
04:07:51.429 --> 04:07:51.439 align:start position:0%
be comparing apples to apples and not
 
04:07:53.269 --> 04:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
apples to oranges so comparing us to
 
04:07:53.279 --> 04:07:54.389 align:start position:0%
apples to oranges so comparing us to
thailand

04:07:54.389 --> 04:07:54.399 align:start position:0%
thailand
 
04:07:55.910 --> 04:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
is not a valid comparison we should
 
04:07:57.030 --> 04:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
stick with
 
04:07:58.710 --> 04:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
those who continue to face
 
04:08:00.630 --> 04:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
discrimination and
 
04:08:02.550 --> 04:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
shunning by their community by their
 
04:08:04.149 --> 04:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
religious organizations and by their
 
04:08:04.159 --> 04:08:05.110 align:start position:0%
religious organizations and by their
family

04:08:05.110 --> 04:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:08:07.429 --> 04:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
versus those who are affirmed in their
 
04:08:07.439 --> 04:08:08.469 align:start position:0%
versus those who are affirmed in their
feelings

04:08:08.469 --> 04:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
feelings
 
04:08:10.070 --> 04:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's the valid
 
04:08:10.080 --> 04:08:13.590 align:start position:0%
that's the valid
comparison

04:08:13.590 --> 04:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:18.070 --> 04:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:21.030 --> 04:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
the the challenges
 
04:08:21.040 --> 04:08:22.550 align:start position:0%
the the challenges
that

04:08:22.550 --> 04:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:08:24.790 --> 04:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
representative knurk has raised is is
 
04:08:29.830 --> 04:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:29.840 --> 04:08:30.950 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:08:30.950 --> 04:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:08:33.910 --> 04:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned with this bill
 
04:08:36.149 --> 04:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
if a if a
 
04:08:39.110 --> 04:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
if a child a transgender child goes out
 
04:08:40.630 --> 04:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
for a team and is told they can't
 
04:08:42.389 --> 04:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
compete by a
 
04:08:44.469 --> 04:08:44.479 align:start position:0%
local entity
 
04:08:46.710 --> 04:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
by a public entity
 
04:08:46.720 --> 04:08:47.670 align:start position:0%
by a public entity
is

04:08:47.670 --> 04:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:08:50.149 --> 04:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
they may be depressed just as depressed
 
04:08:52.389 --> 04:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
as a child as a another
 
04:08:55.590 --> 04:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
genetic girl that plays however
 
04:08:58.149 --> 04:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
that transgender person
 
04:09:01.590 --> 04:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
will have been judged by the community
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
the public entity
 
04:09:05.429 --> 04:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
and they will have to deal with that as
 
04:09:05.439 --> 04:09:06.469 align:start position:0%
and they will have to deal with that as
well

04:09:06.469 --> 04:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:09:08.790 --> 04:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
so the impact on them and the potential
 
04:09:11.990 --> 04:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
of suicide is even greater at that point
 
04:09:13.910 --> 04:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
because now they have no fallback
 
04:09:15.510 --> 04:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
they've been told by
 
04:09:24.469 --> 04:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:28.630 --> 04:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:30.630 --> 04:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
after listening to this
 
04:09:30.640 --> 04:09:32.149 align:start position:0%
after listening to this
conversation

04:09:32.149 --> 04:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
04:09:32.159 --> 04:09:33.110 align:start position:0%
conversation
i

04:09:33.110 --> 04:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:09:34.790 --> 04:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
begin to realize this is a relatively
 
04:09:36.710 --> 04:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
complex area
 
04:09:38.710 --> 04:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we're in a position
 
04:09:41.030 --> 04:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
today at least i know i'm not
 
04:09:44.070 --> 04:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
to take something so complex
 
04:09:45.830 --> 04:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
and to take a simple point about that
 
04:09:45.840 --> 04:09:47.189 align:start position:0%
and to take a simple point about that
complexity

04:09:47.189 --> 04:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
complexity
 
04:09:48.630 --> 04:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
and make a rule on it
 
04:09:56.469 --> 04:09:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:56.479 --> 04:09:58.950 align:start position:0%
 
cannon

04:09:58.950 --> 04:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:00.790 --> 04:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
i would like to give
 
04:10:02.630 --> 04:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
the committee an idea of what we're
 
04:10:04.790 --> 04:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
dealing with as far as the size of the
 
04:10:04.800 --> 04:10:07.349 align:start position:0%
dealing with as far as the size of the
population

04:10:07.349 --> 04:10:07.359 align:start position:0%
population
 
04:10:10.389 --> 04:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we have about six
 
04:10:16.149 --> 04:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:17.750 --> 04:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's not even one percent of the
 
04:10:20.870 --> 04:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
population that's one third of a percent
 
04:10:22.790 --> 04:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
of the population
 
04:10:25.910 --> 04:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
the number of students transgender
 
04:10:27.830 --> 04:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
students in school
 
04:10:32.790 --> 04:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
is less than 500 across the entire state
 
04:10:36.070 --> 04:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
the number of students in that community
 
04:10:38.389 --> 04:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
that actually play sports
 
04:10:41.189 --> 04:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
is substantially less
 
04:10:43.269 --> 04:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
so we are talking about putting a
 
04:10:45.110 --> 04:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
statute in place
 
04:10:49.269 --> 04:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
for a very very tiny number of people in
 
04:10:51.189 --> 04:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
04:10:52.790 --> 04:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
this is this is
 
04:10:55.189 --> 04:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
focused attention on a small group of
 
04:10:57.670 --> 04:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
people instead of working with the
 
04:11:00.630 --> 04:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
policy boards for the communities for
 
04:11:02.710 --> 04:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
that's for the
 
04:11:02.720 --> 04:11:03.750 align:start position:0%
that's for the
schools

04:11:03.750 --> 04:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
schools
 
04:11:05.830 --> 04:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
which they do they can control the
 
04:11:07.990 --> 04:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
policies within the school
 
04:11:11.269 --> 04:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
the the state intercollastics inter
 
04:11:13.670 --> 04:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
scholastic sports
 
04:11:16.550 --> 04:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
athletic association has a policy they
 
04:11:21.269 --> 04:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
have put in place it's a very good one
 
04:11:25.349 --> 04:11:25.359 align:start position:0%
the ncaa has a policy in place
 
04:11:26.950 --> 04:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
to support
 
04:11:29.189 --> 04:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
transgender people
 
04:11:32.389 --> 04:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
in our colleges and universities
 
04:11:34.550 --> 04:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's where
 
04:11:37.990 --> 04:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
it should be decided consistently across
 
04:11:40.309 --> 04:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
organizations for the
 
04:11:43.349 --> 04:11:43.359 align:start position:0%
small number of people that will
 
04:11:46.630 --> 04:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
actually be impacted by this if we put
 
04:11:48.870 --> 04:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
this into statute
 
04:11:49.990 --> 04:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
the way it
 
04:11:50.000 --> 04:11:50.950 align:start position:0%
the way it
is

04:11:50.950 --> 04:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:11:54.870 --> 04:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:56.870 --> 04:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
a very small number of transgender
 
04:11:59.429 --> 04:11:59.439 align:start position:0%
students and put them on notice they are
 
04:11:59.439 --> 04:12:01.269 align:start position:0%
students and put them on notice they are
different

04:12:01.269 --> 04:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:12:04.229 --> 04:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
than other students in this school
 
04:12:07.429 --> 04:12:07.439 align:start position:0%
because they won't be allowed to compete
 
04:12:08.790 --> 04:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
even though we're not taking into
 
04:12:08.800 --> 04:12:10.229 align:start position:0%
even though we're not taking into
consideration

04:12:10.229 --> 04:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
04:12:13.510 --> 04:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
that the number of transgender students
 
04:12:15.990 --> 04:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
that can actually compete at a very high
 
04:12:19.750 --> 04:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
level is very small
 
04:12:21.030 --> 04:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
there are many
 
04:12:23.750 --> 04:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
transgender students competing in sports
 
04:12:26.469 --> 04:12:26.479 align:start position:0%
already that compete head-to-head with
 
04:12:29.189 --> 04:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
their female peers
 
04:12:30.630 --> 04:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
04:12:33.269 --> 04:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
difference in their ability especially
 
04:12:35.030 --> 04:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
those students that have been on hormone
 
04:12:37.830 --> 04:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
blockers since the age of 13
 
04:12:40.229 --> 04:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
they have not developed at the same rate
 
04:12:41.830 --> 04:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
as other students
 
04:12:44.790 --> 04:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
so we may be talking about a couple
 
04:12:47.269 --> 04:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
handfuls of students
 
04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
that can compete at a very high level
 
04:12:51.429 --> 04:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
that are transgender
 
04:12:53.670 --> 04:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
and for those students we should be
 
04:12:55.590 --> 04:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
depending on our
 
04:12:56.710 --> 04:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
on our
 
04:12:58.550 --> 04:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
organizations that are responsible for
 
04:13:00.950 --> 04:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
policies to find a way to work with
 
04:13:03.189 --> 04:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
those students and the schools to make
 
04:13:06.389 --> 04:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
it a safe environment for all in fact
 
04:13:07.309 --> 04:13:07.319 align:start position:0%
both the
 
04:13:10.710 --> 04:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
nhiaa and the ncaa
 
04:13:13.830 --> 04:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
have in their statement they recognize
 
04:13:16.149 --> 04:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
04:13:18.550 --> 04:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
male and female students and transgender
 
04:13:21.110 --> 04:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
male and female students and that all
 
04:13:21.120 --> 04:13:22.149 align:start position:0%
male and female students and that all
people

04:13:22.149 --> 04:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
must be able to compete
 
04:13:25.990 --> 04:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
in their
 
04:13:28.790 --> 04:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
their policies are directed to that to
 
04:13:31.030 --> 04:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
keep a level playing field
 
04:13:33.670 --> 04:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
in the sports environment especially for
 
04:13:33.680 --> 04:13:35.590 align:start position:0%
in the sports environment especially for
interscholastic

04:13:35.590 --> 04:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
interscholastic
 
04:13:35.600 --> 04:13:36.630 align:start position:0%
interscholastic
um

04:13:36.630 --> 04:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:40.870 --> 04:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
situations thank you
 
04:13:43.110 --> 04:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
04:13:45.030 --> 04:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for that representative that
 
04:13:47.590 --> 04:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
was really powerful and really important
 
04:13:48.870 --> 04:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
and i thank you
 
04:13:52.550 --> 04:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
um that last part you spoke to the ncaa
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
recognizing the the different categories
 
04:13:56.149 --> 04:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
of students and accommodating them
 
04:13:56.159 --> 04:13:58.309 align:start position:0%
of students and accommodating them
appropriately

04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
04:13:58.319 --> 04:13:59.590 align:start position:0%
appropriately
the

04:13:59.590 --> 04:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:14:02.229 --> 04:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
the spill doesn't say that you need to
 
04:14:04.550 --> 04:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't give any requirements to do
 
04:14:06.469 --> 04:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
anything differently there are some some
 
04:14:08.710 --> 04:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
states that the way that it's
 
04:14:10.229 --> 04:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
interpreting it it would say that you
 
04:14:11.590 --> 04:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't even interpret things the way
 
04:14:14.550 --> 04:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
that the ncaa requires it to
 
04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
because some other states in california
 
04:14:18.469 --> 04:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
they've ruled that what your driver's
 
04:14:21.429 --> 04:14:21.439 align:start position:0%
license is is what is is your identity
 
04:14:23.750 --> 04:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
and your biologic sex so in that you
 
04:14:25.910 --> 04:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't have the accommodations
 
04:14:28.469 --> 04:14:28.479 align:start position:0%
for a transgendered athlete in ncaa if
 
04:14:30.950 --> 04:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
the state only recognizes you
 
04:14:32.309 --> 04:14:32.319 align:start position:0%
as your
 
04:14:34.309 --> 04:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
affirmed gender
 
04:14:36.870 --> 04:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
as your biologic sex so it would it does
 
04:14:38.870 --> 04:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
away with some of those clarifications
 
04:14:39.990 --> 04:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
and some of those
 
04:14:43.429 --> 04:14:43.439 align:start position:0%
those details um the risk here is that
 
04:14:45.189 --> 04:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
our courts might interpret this the way
 
04:14:48.070 --> 04:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
that other states have interpreted it um
 
04:14:50.389 --> 04:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
and that that ends up taking away more
 
04:14:52.149 --> 04:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
people's rights because they're applying
 
04:14:54.389 --> 04:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
a one-size-fits-all if this is what your
 
04:14:56.149 --> 04:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
driver's license says this is what you
 
04:14:58.389 --> 04:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
are and we know we're all so much more
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
complex than our driver's license
 
04:15:02.389 --> 04:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
i'm sitting here i don't know the best
 
04:15:04.309 --> 04:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
way to do this because i don't want our
 
04:15:05.830 --> 04:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
state to come down
 
04:15:07.590 --> 04:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
and say that we can't have any of these
 
04:15:09.750 --> 04:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
differentiations but i feel like there's
 
04:15:11.670 --> 04:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
a risk too if we completely get rid of
 
04:15:13.030 --> 04:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
this because
 
04:15:14.870 --> 04:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
we might you know
 
04:15:17.189 --> 04:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
because there's consequences both ways
 
04:15:17.199 --> 04:15:18.389 align:start position:0%
because there's consequences both ways
and

04:15:18.389 --> 04:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:15:18.399 --> 04:15:21.910 align:start position:0%
and
yeah

04:15:21.910 --> 04:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:27.590 --> 04:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:30.830 --> 04:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
so would not the answer be an interim
 
04:15:33.910 --> 04:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
study and i did see a representative
 
04:15:35.269 --> 04:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
merchant over there waving his hand and
 
04:15:37.269 --> 04:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
i'd second him there is a motion already
 
04:15:39.670 --> 04:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
on the floor to move the amendment
 
04:15:43.030 --> 04:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay all we can do is either the uh
 
04:15:45.670 --> 04:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
motioner and second have the right to
 
04:15:45.680 --> 04:15:46.710 align:start position:0%
motioner and second have the right to
withdraw

04:15:46.710 --> 04:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
withdraw
 
04:15:48.550 --> 04:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
if they do not wish to do that we have
 
04:15:50.950 --> 04:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
to vote the amendment and then we can go
 
04:15:55.269 --> 04:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:57.030 --> 04:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
you may withdraw
 
04:15:59.189 --> 04:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
the motion then you may make another
 
04:16:02.070 --> 04:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
motion if you're recognized to do so
 
04:16:05.590 --> 04:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
okay then i respectfully withdraw
 
04:16:08.389 --> 04:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:11.830 --> 04:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
motion to pass on the amendment 959
 
04:16:13.830 --> 04:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative acton you had seconded
 
04:16:22.149 --> 04:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:24.229 --> 04:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
that means i asked the parliamentarian a
 
04:16:26.469 --> 04:16:26.479 align:start position:0%
question does it have to be both of them
 
04:16:26.479 --> 04:16:28.870 align:start position:0%
question does it have to be both of them
agree

04:16:28.870 --> 04:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
agree
 
04:16:34.469 --> 04:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:37.750 --> 04:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
oh you're blinking look at you
 
04:16:37.760 --> 04:16:38.630 align:start position:0%
oh you're blinking look at you
there's

04:16:38.630 --> 04:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:16:40.309 --> 04:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
everybody who's not talking shut your
 
04:16:43.110 --> 04:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
mic off a challenge everything
 
04:16:46.389 --> 04:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
okay i believe it's the the the
 
04:16:48.389 --> 04:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
moving party and the second or both have
 
04:16:50.229 --> 04:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
to withdraw so
 
04:16:50.239 --> 04:16:53.429 align:start position:0%
to withdraw so
um

04:16:53.429 --> 04:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:54.830 --> 04:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
that's what i understand
 
04:16:57.510 --> 04:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
yeah in the which case though on the
 
04:16:59.429 --> 04:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
other hand there
 
04:17:02.309 --> 04:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
i believe and i'm just working this
 
04:17:04.309 --> 04:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
through so if anybody has any other
 
04:17:06.070 --> 04:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
ideas let me know
 
04:17:06.080 --> 04:17:07.189 align:start position:0%
ideas let me know
uh

04:17:07.189 --> 04:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:17:11.349 --> 04:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
we can adopt the amendment and if nobody
 
04:17:13.990 --> 04:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
chooses to move on to pass as amended
 
04:17:16.469 --> 04:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
somebody could make a different motion
 
04:17:18.469 --> 04:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
that is where i was going i just wanted
 
04:17:20.389 --> 04:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
to check with
 
04:17:23.110 --> 04:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
your much greater wisdom and experience
 
04:17:25.429 --> 04:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
in mind
 
04:24:09.269 --> 04:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
the status of the amendment now
 
04:24:13.910 --> 04:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
has the seconder
 
04:24:17.269 --> 04:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
with the uh mover withdrawn
 
04:24:20.469 --> 04:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
my parliamentarians research has told me
 
04:24:20.479 --> 04:24:21.670 align:start position:0%
my parliamentarians research has told me
that

04:24:21.670 --> 04:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:24:24.229 --> 04:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
representative acton by default can
 
04:24:26.790 --> 04:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
become the mover of the amendment and it
 
04:24:28.950 --> 04:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
will need to have a second
 
04:24:31.670 --> 04:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
and representative gay now becomes the
 
04:24:34.790 --> 04:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
second so now the motion is back in the
 
04:24:37.590 --> 04:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
amendment is now back in play with the
 
04:24:39.910 --> 04:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
motion of ought to pass
 
04:24:44.630 --> 04:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:46.229 --> 04:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
04:24:48.550 --> 04:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
the motion is the amendment
 
04:24:50.630 --> 04:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
04:24:50.640 --> 04:25:04.630 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
having

04:25:04.630 --> 04:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:07.269 --> 04:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
it is flipped
 
04:25:09.590 --> 04:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
we needed a second or you became the
 
04:25:12.469 --> 04:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
mover by not withdrawing we needed a
 
04:25:15.110 --> 04:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
seconder if so happens uh representative
 
04:25:16.950 --> 04:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
gay becomes the seconder so it is
 
04:25:16.960 --> 04:25:22.630 align:start position:0%
gay becomes the seconder so it is
flipped

04:25:22.630 --> 04:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:26.710 --> 04:25:26.720 align:start position:0%

04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
amended because of the testimony from
 
04:27:14.550 --> 04:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
the department of justice the assistant
 
04:27:17.189 --> 04:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
attorney general sean glock came
 
04:27:19.990 --> 04:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
and pointed out that this that
 
04:27:23.110 --> 04:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
we have our transgender rights uh that
 
04:27:26.229 --> 04:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
were codified a couple of years ago
 
04:27:27.990 --> 04:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:27:29.510 --> 04:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:27:30.790 --> 04:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
that that
 
04:27:32.870 --> 04:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
prohibits discrimination
 
04:27:34.309 --> 04:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
but this bill
 
04:27:37.189 --> 04:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
allows discrimination
 
04:27:39.269 --> 04:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
and with that in mind it leads to a
 
04:27:41.750 --> 04:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
conflict in the statute so
 
04:27:41.760 --> 04:27:42.630 align:start position:0%
conflict in the statute so
again

04:27:42.630 --> 04:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:27:44.229 --> 04:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
the previous bill prohibits
 
04:27:45.510 --> 04:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
discrimination with
 
04:27:47.269 --> 04:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
gender identity this bill allows them to
 
04:27:49.990 --> 04:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
that is a conflict in law
 
04:27:51.750 --> 04:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
um he stated that very clearly they
 
04:27:54.469 --> 04:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
didn't take a position but
 
04:27:56.870 --> 04:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
that is going to be a problem in terms
 
04:27:58.149 --> 04:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
of how
 
04:28:01.189 --> 04:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:05.830 --> 04:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:08.070 --> 04:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro thank you mr
 
04:28:10.070 --> 04:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
chairman i think as we so often say
 
04:28:12.070 --> 04:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
there uh either way we vote on this
 
04:28:13.349 --> 04:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
there are
 
04:28:13.359 --> 04:28:14.710 align:start position:0%
there are
um

04:28:14.710 --> 04:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:16.790 --> 04:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
consequences and there are benefits and
 
04:28:20.389 --> 04:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
in this case um the way i see it is the
 
04:28:22.229 --> 04:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
you know there might be a case where
 
04:28:24.790 --> 04:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
there's actually a
 
04:28:29.030 --> 04:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
very strong transgender female who um
 
04:28:31.830 --> 04:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
has an unfair advantage although
 
04:28:33.990 --> 04:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
um the chairman said he has an unaware
 
04:28:36.070 --> 04:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
of one even though he collects um i'm
 
04:28:37.830 --> 04:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
not aware of one in new hampshire
 
04:28:40.149 --> 04:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
specifically yes right correctly correct
 
04:28:42.309 --> 04:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
so that could be a case i acknowledge
 
04:28:43.830 --> 04:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:28:46.550 --> 04:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
but on the other side the consequence is
 
04:28:48.790 --> 04:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
that we are marginalizing a group of
 
04:28:48.800 --> 04:28:49.750 align:start position:0%
that we are marginalizing a group of
people

04:28:49.750 --> 04:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:28:51.670 --> 04:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
and potentially affecting their
 
04:28:51.680 --> 04:28:53.670 align:start position:0%
and potentially affecting their
self-esteem

04:28:53.670 --> 04:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
self-esteem
 
04:28:55.590 --> 04:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
in the extreme case even affecting their
 
04:28:56.790 --> 04:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
04:28:59.269 --> 04:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
so either way we turn there's a
 
04:29:01.349 --> 04:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
benefit and a
 
04:29:01.359 --> 04:29:03.510 align:start position:0%
benefit and a
consequence

04:29:03.510 --> 04:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
consequence
 
04:29:07.189 --> 04:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:11.189 --> 04:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote against this because
 
04:29:13.189 --> 04:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
i think number one it's more important
 
04:29:14.870 --> 04:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
to protect
 
04:29:17.429 --> 04:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
those people who are marginalized
 
04:29:19.830 --> 04:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
and are vulnerable
 
04:29:23.269 --> 04:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is i think that we
 
04:29:24.550 --> 04:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
there's certainly some young
 
04:29:26.469 --> 04:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
representatives here but a lot of us are
 
04:29:28.550 --> 04:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
old and i think
 
04:29:30.630 --> 04:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
i think the younger generation has moved
 
04:29:31.910 --> 04:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
on with this
 
04:29:36.070 --> 04:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
there's a great deal of acceptance of
 
04:29:38.149 --> 04:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
youth in schools who are very different
 
04:29:40.790 --> 04:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
that would not have been the case
 
04:29:44.790 --> 04:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
20 years ago 10 years ago but i think
 
04:29:46.950 --> 04:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
younger generations have really moved on
 
04:29:50.309 --> 04:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
i i often um get the job of playing um
 
04:29:51.830 --> 04:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
pretend with my seven-year-old
 
04:29:51.840 --> 04:29:53.110 align:start position:0%
pretend with my seven-year-old
granddaughter

04:29:53.110 --> 04:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
granddaughter
 
04:29:54.790 --> 04:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
because nobody else has the patience to
 
04:29:57.189 --> 04:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
do it so we're sitting there with um
 
04:29:59.830 --> 04:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
stuffed animals and dolls and talking to
 
04:30:01.990 --> 04:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
each other and um
 
04:30:04.309 --> 04:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
that's pretend and my granddaughter
 
04:30:07.110 --> 04:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
frankie says
 
04:30:09.110 --> 04:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
you know i'll refer to sally and she'll
 
04:30:11.429 --> 04:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
say that's not sally that's george
 
04:30:13.110 --> 04:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
and i'll say frankie you told me it was
 
04:30:15.830 --> 04:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
sally you told me it was a girl and she
 
04:30:17.990 --> 04:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
says to me grandpa you can be anything
 
04:30:19.429 --> 04:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
you want to be
 
04:30:19.439 --> 04:30:20.630 align:start position:0%
you want to be
and

04:30:20.630 --> 04:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:30:23.110 --> 04:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
i think that is a sign of the
 
04:30:25.349 --> 04:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
generations to come that will make these
 
04:30:26.790 --> 04:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
kinds of things
 
04:30:28.469 --> 04:30:28.479 align:start position:0%
irrelevant eventually
 
04:30:30.469 --> 04:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
and i think we can make it irrelevant
 
04:30:37.269 --> 04:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:39.750 --> 04:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
04:30:40.830 --> 04:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:30:43.510 --> 04:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
mr uh thank you for that testimony um
 
04:30:45.910 --> 04:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative shabaro
 
04:30:47.590 --> 04:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
when i look at this bill even the
 
04:30:49.750 --> 04:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
amendment itself
 
04:30:51.750 --> 04:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's what they call what i call an
 
04:30:51.760 --> 04:30:53.269 align:start position:0%
it's what they call what i call an
oxymoron

04:30:53.269 --> 04:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
oxymoron
 
04:30:54.710 --> 04:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
because what i'm trying to get to is
 
04:30:56.950 --> 04:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
that in this we're identifying people to
 
04:30:56.960 --> 04:30:57.750 align:start position:0%
that in this we're identifying people to
be

04:30:57.750 --> 04:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:31:00.229 --> 04:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
biologically one way or the other
 
04:31:02.070 --> 04:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
yet this in the statute says we're not
 
04:31:04.070 --> 04:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
going to use that differentiation
 
04:31:06.229 --> 04:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
to prohibit them
 
04:31:07.910 --> 04:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
in competing
 
04:31:10.389 --> 04:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
in either any other sport so i don't
 
04:31:12.790 --> 04:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
stand behind this whole thing is on one
 
04:31:14.149 --> 04:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
side of the coin we're going to say well
 
04:31:15.670 --> 04:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
you belong to this one listen but you
 
04:31:15.680 --> 04:31:16.389 align:start position:0%
you belong to this one listen but you
can

04:31:16.389 --> 04:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:31:17.670 --> 04:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day
 
04:31:20.149 --> 04:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
choose whatever side you want to be on
 
04:31:23.110 --> 04:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
so it to me it's a it's a paradox or
 
04:31:25.030 --> 04:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
maybe even an oxymoron
 
04:31:25.910 --> 04:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:31:27.590 --> 04:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
one side of the coin which claim to
 
04:31:29.670 --> 04:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
people you have to decide which team you
 
04:31:31.349 --> 04:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
want to be on oh by the way you can
 
04:31:33.349 --> 04:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
participate on any team you want
 
04:31:34.950 --> 04:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't make any sense the way
 
04:31:37.189 --> 04:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
this bill is written
 
04:31:39.110 --> 04:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
for us to pass it i go back to i said
 
04:31:40.870 --> 04:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
before i would think
 
04:31:41.990 --> 04:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:31:42.000 --> 04:31:43.590 align:start position:0%
with the
complexity

04:31:43.590 --> 04:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
complexity
 
04:31:45.510 --> 04:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
the emotions and the passions we all
 
04:31:45.520 --> 04:31:46.790 align:start position:0%
the emotions and the passions we all
have

04:31:46.790 --> 04:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:31:48.630 --> 04:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
is to go to interim study
 
04:31:49.670 --> 04:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
so that
 
04:31:51.590 --> 04:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
we can take a deep dive into the subject
 
04:31:53.429 --> 04:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
better hear from people from all sides
 
04:31:54.790 --> 04:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
of the fence
 
04:31:55.910 --> 04:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
and make
 
04:31:58.309 --> 04:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
a decision that's appropriate
 
04:32:00.149 --> 04:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
and not to take the time today to try to
 
04:32:04.630 --> 04:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:10.149 --> 04:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:11.670 --> 04:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
when this bill
 
04:32:15.590 --> 04:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:18.389 --> 04:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
i received
 
04:32:20.469 --> 04:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
hundreds of emails you may not have
 
04:32:21.990 --> 04:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
received them
 
04:32:25.110 --> 04:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
i know you have received many from from
 
04:32:27.349 --> 04:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
upset people
 
04:32:28.870 --> 04:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
i've received
 
04:32:31.269 --> 04:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
messages from
 
04:32:34.790 --> 04:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
people of my era and your era
 
04:32:37.349 --> 04:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
people who have lived
 
04:32:37.359 --> 04:32:38.309 align:start position:0%
people who have lived
um

04:32:38.309 --> 04:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:40.389 --> 04:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
trent as transgender people for all of
 
04:32:43.670 --> 04:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
their lives for many many years
 
04:32:47.189 --> 04:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:49.269 --> 04:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
because this bill
 
04:32:53.030 --> 04:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
treats them as second-class citizens
 
04:32:56.469 --> 04:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
it makes them feel incredibly small and
 
04:32:58.790 --> 04:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
victimized by a whole system that says
 
04:33:02.070 --> 04:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't exist
 
04:33:04.949 --> 04:33:04.959 align:start position:0%
in just discussing this bill
 
04:33:07.269 --> 04:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
we're telling transgender people that
 
04:33:10.230 --> 04:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
they can't be transgender people
 
04:33:13.590 --> 04:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
we need to make the decision for them
 
04:33:17.029 --> 04:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
and that's wrong
 
04:33:18.310 --> 04:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
i put up
 
04:33:21.269 --> 04:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
i beat myself up because i didn't want
 
04:33:24.070 --> 04:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
to be a transgender p person because
 
04:33:26.869 --> 04:33:26.879 align:start position:0%
society was against me and that's what i
 
04:33:30.470 --> 04:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
see here it's the same thing
 
04:33:32.629 --> 04:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
that's what transgender people have to
 
04:33:34.709 --> 04:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
deal with every day
 
04:33:37.189 --> 04:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
and here we are in the state house
 
04:33:40.070 --> 04:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
discussing legislation that puts them on
 
04:33:45.109 --> 04:33:45.119 align:start position:0%
notice that they can't be who they are
 
04:33:49.830 --> 04:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:54.390 --> 04:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:56.070 --> 04:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
i have a 10 year old daughter i've said
 
04:33:59.269 --> 04:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
that before
 
04:34:01.510 --> 04:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
she's athletic and when she gets into
 
04:34:03.029 --> 04:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
high school she'll
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:08.230 --> 04:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
i believe that
 
04:34:09.670 --> 04:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
this situation
 
04:34:09.680 --> 04:34:11.029 align:start position:0%
this situation
where

04:34:11.029 --> 04:34:11.039 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:34:13.590 --> 04:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
trans people can take part in in a sport
 
04:34:15.990 --> 04:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
like this takes away her rights her
 
04:34:20.230 --> 04:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
rights to to fairly compete in a sport
 
04:34:22.949 --> 04:34:22.959 align:start position:0%
and and have the chance of winning
 
04:34:25.349 --> 04:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
and i i don't hear any discussion of the
 
04:34:27.510 --> 04:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
rights taken away from other people now
 
04:34:29.429 --> 04:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
i have supported
 
04:34:32.150 --> 04:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
glbt rights for from the get-go no one
 
04:34:36.869 --> 04:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
can say i haven't i ran for in a senate
 
04:34:39.429 --> 04:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
primary as a openly
 
04:34:42.551 --> 04:34:42.561 align:start position:0%
pro-gay marriage republican in 2012. and
 
04:34:47.109 --> 04:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
i got 24 of the vote not six or seven
 
04:34:50.390 --> 04:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know so i've i understand the issues
 
04:34:52.869 --> 04:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
but in this case it's it's a matter of
 
04:34:54.709 --> 04:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
basic fairness
 
04:34:56.551 --> 04:34:56.561 align:start position:0%
should my daughter
 
04:34:57.910 --> 04:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
have to compete
 
04:35:01.189 --> 04:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
with biological males and sports now
 
04:35:02.949 --> 04:35:02.959 align:start position:0%
i i say that
 
04:35:05.990 --> 04:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
we need to move move into this
 
04:35:06.869 --> 04:35:06.879 align:start position:0%
in a
 
04:35:09.510 --> 04:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
step-by-step fashion week and in this
 
04:35:12.310 --> 04:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
case i think this all we're doing here
 
04:35:13.670 --> 04:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
is allowing
 
04:35:17.029 --> 04:35:17.039 align:start position:0%
local local bodies to use that in as
 
04:35:19.750 --> 04:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
part of their decision making
 
04:35:21.750 --> 04:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
and that's we're not forcing them to do
 
04:35:23.590 --> 04:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
anything we're not mandating anything
 
04:35:25.910 --> 04:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're simply allowing it
 
04:35:27.990 --> 04:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:35:31.109 --> 04:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
just discussing that we're being
 
04:35:32.551 --> 04:35:32.561 align:start position:0%
told that we're we're
 
04:35:34.150 --> 04:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
damaging people and we're causing
 
04:35:36.230 --> 04:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
suicides the hyperbole is getting a
 
04:35:38.789 --> 04:35:38.799 align:start position:0%
little out of control here let's step
 
04:35:41.029 --> 04:35:41.039 align:start position:0%
back to this issue is the way i see is a
 
04:35:44.150 --> 04:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
basic level of fairness for my daughter
 
04:35:45.750 --> 04:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
my wife's very concerned about this and
 
04:35:47.109 --> 04:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
many people are but they don't even want
 
04:35:47.910 --> 04:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
to talk about it because they're
 
04:35:47.920 --> 04:35:49.590 align:start position:0%
to talk about it because they're
intimidated

04:35:49.590 --> 04:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
intimidated
 
04:35:51.189 --> 04:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
so that's let's take a step back and
 
04:35:52.869 --> 04:35:52.879 align:start position:0%
look at the narrow thing that we're
 
04:35:56.070 --> 04:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
doing it relates to sports only
 
04:35:59.029 --> 04:35:59.039 align:start position:0%
and it's related to fair basic issue of
 
04:35:59.039 --> 04:36:00.070 align:start position:0%
and it's related to fair basic issue of
fairness

04:36:00.070 --> 04:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
fairness
 
04:36:03.510 --> 04:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:07.349 --> 04:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:10.629 --> 04:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
i sit on somersworth's school board
 
04:36:12.390 --> 04:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
in fact we're going to be
 
04:36:13.750 --> 04:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
04:36:16.709 --> 04:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
transgender policy policy jbab in the
 
04:36:19.990 --> 04:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:22.070 --> 04:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
it is completely
 
04:36:22.080 --> 04:36:23.750 align:start position:0%
it is completely
modifiable

04:36:23.750 --> 04:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
modifiable
 
04:36:25.990 --> 04:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
depending on the school district
 
04:36:29.830 --> 04:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
a school district can decide for itself
 
04:36:32.869 --> 04:36:32.879 align:start position:0%
how it wants to support transgender
 
04:36:32.879 --> 04:36:33.910 align:start position:0%
how it wants to support transgender
children

04:36:33.910 --> 04:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:36:35.670 --> 04:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
in fact there's one district in new
 
04:36:35.680 --> 04:36:36.789 align:start position:0%
in fact there's one district in new
hampshire

04:36:36.789 --> 04:36:36.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:36:39.269 --> 04:36:39.279 align:start position:0%
with their administration has been told
 
04:36:41.830 --> 04:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
if you have a child that identifies as
 
04:36:41.840 --> 04:36:43.109 align:start position:0%
if you have a child that identifies as
transgender

04:36:43.109 --> 04:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
transgender
 
04:36:46.949 --> 04:36:46.959 align:start position:0%
we need to report it to their parents
 
04:36:50.869 --> 04:36:50.879 align:start position:0%
talk about being scared to death
 
04:36:52.551 --> 04:36:52.561 align:start position:0%
the kids
 
04:36:55.590 --> 04:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:57.670 --> 04:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
especially transgender kids who have
 
04:37:00.470 --> 04:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
drawn have grown up with their peers
 
04:37:02.629 --> 04:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
male or female
 
04:37:04.789 --> 04:37:04.799 align:start position:0%
want to compete
 
04:37:07.510 --> 04:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
with those same people
 
04:37:10.230 --> 04:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
if there's a problem with that
 
04:37:12.709 --> 04:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
the school administration has the right
 
04:37:14.709 --> 04:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
to work with those
 
04:37:17.429 --> 04:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
kids and their families to find the
 
04:37:17.439 --> 04:37:19.109 align:start position:0%
kids and their families to find the
solution

04:37:19.109 --> 04:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
solution
 
04:37:21.189 --> 04:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
if it goes beyond that
 
04:37:24.551 --> 04:37:24.561 align:start position:0%
they can take it to court
 
04:37:28.390 --> 04:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
should we be putting in a statute that
 
04:37:31.349 --> 04:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
regulates what they can or can't do
 
04:37:33.269 --> 04:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
or should we leave it to the local
 
04:37:33.279 --> 04:37:34.629 align:start position:0%
or should we leave it to the local
entities

04:37:34.629 --> 04:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
entities
 
04:37:37.429 --> 04:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
as has is identified in this bill leave
 
04:37:41.269 --> 04:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
it to them which they can already do
 
04:37:43.750 --> 04:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
and take it to court if it goes beyond
 
04:37:43.760 --> 04:37:46.709 align:start position:0%
and take it to court if it goes beyond
that

04:37:46.709 --> 04:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:49.109 --> 04:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's all i'm saying i want your
 
04:37:51.109 --> 04:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
kids to be able to play
 
04:37:53.990 --> 04:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
and to make if there's an issue
 
04:37:56.551 --> 04:37:56.561 align:start position:0%
bring it up at the school boards
 
04:37:59.830 --> 04:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
bring it up to the local court
 
04:38:01.910 --> 04:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
have them make the decision
 
04:38:08.230 --> 04:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:10.949 --> 04:38:10.959 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
 
04:38:10.959 --> 04:38:11.990 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
chairman

04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:38:13.990 --> 04:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative cannon it sounds like you
 
04:38:17.429 --> 04:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
support local decision making on this
 
04:38:19.830 --> 04:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
and i don't see anything in here that
 
04:38:22.551 --> 04:38:22.561 align:start position:0%
would change the local decision making
 
04:38:24.070 --> 04:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
is there something that i'm missing here
 
04:38:25.990 --> 04:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
i believe that this just clarifies that
 
04:38:27.750 --> 04:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
the local school boards are in fact
 
04:38:30.869 --> 04:38:30.879 align:start position:0%
allowed to make those decisions
 
04:38:32.070 --> 04:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
04:38:33.189 --> 04:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
04:38:35.910 --> 04:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me mr chair can i answer that
 
04:38:37.429 --> 04:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
you may
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
04:38:41.109 --> 04:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
local control
 
04:38:44.390 --> 04:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
but if we do put legislation in place
 
04:38:45.990 --> 04:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's a much higher level we are
 
04:38:48.150 --> 04:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
putting something in place that is going
 
04:38:50.830 --> 04:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
to tell a transgender
 
04:38:54.230 --> 04:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
person that they're unwanted
 
04:38:54.240 --> 04:38:55.590 align:start position:0%
person that they're unwanted
we

04:38:55.590 --> 04:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:38:55.600 --> 04:38:58.551 align:start position:0%
we
it's

04:38:58.551 --> 04:38:58.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:03.990 --> 04:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:06.629 --> 04:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
here's the nub
 
04:39:10.230 --> 04:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
currently in our statutes the default is
 
04:39:10.240 --> 04:39:13.349 align:start position:0%
currently in our statutes the default is
non-discrimination

04:39:13.349 --> 04:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:15.510 --> 04:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's recognizing people for who they
 
04:39:18.551 --> 04:39:18.561 align:start position:0%
believe themselves to be
 
04:39:21.510 --> 04:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
and it is affirming
 
04:39:24.470 --> 04:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
if we change the law
 
04:39:27.429 --> 04:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:27.439 --> 04:39:28.869 align:start position:0%
 
taking

04:39:28.869 --> 04:39:28.879 align:start position:0%
taking
 
04:39:31.590 --> 04:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
a right that has been extended
 
04:39:31.600 --> 04:39:33.349 align:start position:0%
a right that has been extended
away

04:39:33.349 --> 04:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
away
 
04:39:37.109 --> 04:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
and we are becoming less affirming
 
04:39:39.270 --> 04:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
and we are putting more roadblocks in
 
04:39:41.270 --> 04:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
the way
 
04:39:43.110 --> 04:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
of a kid
 
04:39:45.910 --> 04:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
evolving into the person
 
04:39:48.628 --> 04:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
that they want to be
 
04:39:48.638 --> 04:39:51.910 align:start position:0%
that they want to be
so

04:39:51.910 --> 04:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:55.030 --> 04:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's the problem here
 
04:39:56.868 --> 04:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
people say well it's just permissive
 
04:39:59.670 --> 04:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
well it's perm what it's permitting is
 
04:40:02.788 --> 04:40:02.798 align:start position:0%
discrimination and i understand that the
 
04:40:04.868 --> 04:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
issues are complicated
 
04:40:07.350 --> 04:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
and the issues are scary
 
04:40:10.550 --> 04:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
and the issues are politicized
 
04:40:10.560 --> 04:40:12.150 align:start position:0%
and the issues are politicized
but

04:40:12.150 --> 04:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:40:14.708 --> 04:40:14.718 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is permitting
 
04:40:16.390 --> 04:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
more discrimination
 
04:40:19.110 --> 04:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
rather than less
 
04:40:21.190 --> 04:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
we are permitting it
 
04:40:24.470 --> 04:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:26.628 --> 04:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
but we're still permitting it the
 
04:40:28.708 --> 04:40:28.718 align:start position:0%
question has or the statement has been
 
04:40:30.708 --> 04:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
made it should be decided at the local
 
04:40:36.868 --> 04:40:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:40.708 --> 04:40:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:43.270 --> 04:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:40:45.510 --> 04:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
for the record i would like everybody to
 
04:40:47.510 --> 04:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
know that i am in favor of biological
 
04:40:47.520 --> 04:40:48.550 align:start position:0%
know that i am in favor of biological
sex

04:40:48.550 --> 04:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
sex
 
04:40:50.628 --> 04:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
having enjoyed it several times in my
 
04:40:50.638 --> 04:40:52.070 align:start position:0%
having enjoyed it several times in my
life

04:40:52.070 --> 04:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
life
 
04:40:53.670 --> 04:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
so i certainly can't speak for the
 
04:40:57.110 --> 04:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
um i'm
 
04:41:02.310 --> 04:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
old enough to remember
 
04:41:05.430 --> 04:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
when the vocabulary changed
 
04:41:08.470 --> 04:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
and i believe it was 1956
 
04:41:11.750 --> 04:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
when christine jorgensen
 
04:41:11.760 --> 04:41:12.868 align:start position:0%
when christine jorgensen
changed

04:41:12.868 --> 04:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
changed
 
04:41:12.878 --> 04:41:14.230 align:start position:0%
changed
gender

04:41:14.230 --> 04:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
gender
 
04:41:18.390 --> 04:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
and since then over the last 65 years
 
04:41:21.350 --> 04:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
the language has changed and we are
 
04:41:24.390 --> 04:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
debating a language that is now
 
04:41:24.400 --> 04:41:25.510 align:start position:0%
debating a language that is now
thoroughly

04:41:25.510 --> 04:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
thoroughly
 
04:41:26.788 --> 04:41:26.798 align:start position:0%
out of date
 
04:41:30.390 --> 04:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
we don't no longer speak about sex we
 
04:41:33.190 --> 04:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
speak about gender
 
04:41:36.708 --> 04:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
in polite company frankly we don't say
 
04:41:36.718 --> 04:41:37.830 align:start position:0%
in polite company frankly we don't say
queer

04:41:37.830 --> 04:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
queer
 
04:41:39.430 --> 04:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
or dike
 
04:41:42.070 --> 04:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
we talk about gender preference
 
04:41:45.270 --> 04:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
we talk about people's gender identity
 
04:41:47.910 --> 04:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
we talk about gender assignment
 
04:41:51.030 --> 04:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
for children who are born differently
 
04:41:53.510 --> 04:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
we talk about intersex
 
04:41:55.830 --> 04:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
members of our community we talked about
 
04:41:59.110 --> 04:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
people with gender fluidity fluidity
 
04:42:00.628 --> 04:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
we talk about people with gender
 
04:42:04.390 --> 04:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
dysphoria but the language has changed
 
04:42:07.510 --> 04:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
and we are debating in a language that
 
04:42:10.670 --> 04:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
is totally out of date and is
 
04:42:13.990 --> 04:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for our wisdom in this
 
04:42:14.000 --> 04:42:16.310 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for our wisdom in this
legislature

04:42:16.310 --> 04:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
04:42:18.948 --> 04:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
i'm going to step out of the closet for
 
04:42:20.230 --> 04:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
you all
 
04:42:22.948 --> 04:42:22.958 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to tell you that even
 
04:42:25.670 --> 04:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
though i am elected from a democratic
 
04:42:28.550 --> 04:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
district and run as a democrat
 
04:42:30.948 --> 04:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
i am what is called a dino
 
04:42:33.750 --> 04:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
democrat in name only
 
04:42:36.070 --> 04:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is that i would
 
04:42:38.788 --> 04:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
be a libertarian except that i find that
 
04:42:41.670 --> 04:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
the libertarians are more to the left of
 
04:42:41.680 --> 04:42:43.270 align:start position:0%
the libertarians are more to the left of
me

04:42:43.270 --> 04:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:42:45.590 --> 04:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
and i want you to understand that that
 
04:42:49.110 --> 04:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
means that i do not wish to have
 
04:42:52.070 --> 04:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
the heavy hand of government
 
04:42:54.230 --> 04:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
probing my pants
 
04:42:56.230 --> 04:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
or the pants of my children or
 
04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
grandchildren in an attempt to label me
 
04:43:01.670 --> 04:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
or them
 
04:43:05.110 --> 04:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
as something or another
 
04:43:07.830 --> 04:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
this is a local issue it's to be decided
 
04:43:11.110 --> 04:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
by families perhaps by school boards but
 
04:43:13.430 --> 04:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
certainly not by
 
04:43:16.788 --> 04:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
a heavy-handed legislature
 
04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
though it is
 
04:43:21.110 --> 04:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
heavy-handed of me to say so
 
04:43:23.750 --> 04:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
i don't wish to have a gender
 
04:43:25.830 --> 04:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
determining tattoo
 
04:43:28.788 --> 04:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
on my left arm i don't wish to be told
 
04:43:30.470 --> 04:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
that i need to wear
 
04:43:34.230 --> 04:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
a pink triangle or a yellow star i think
 
04:43:36.550 --> 04:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
we should get out of people's private
 
04:43:36.560 --> 04:43:37.590 align:start position:0%
we should get out of people's private
business

04:43:37.590 --> 04:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:43:39.670 --> 04:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
i think we should interim study this
 
04:43:42.070 --> 04:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
bill and say that we have examined it
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
closely but we are the wrong place for
 
04:43:46.948 --> 04:43:46.958 align:start position:0%
such decisions to be made thank you for
 
04:43:46.958 --> 04:43:50.868 align:start position:0%
such decisions to be made thank you for
listening

04:43:50.868 --> 04:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:52.708 --> 04:43:52.718 align:start position:0%
representative i find some of that
 
04:43:55.350 --> 04:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
language shaming
 
04:43:58.550 --> 04:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
you speak of we no longer say
 
04:44:00.550 --> 04:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of language that you use
 
04:44:01.670 --> 04:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
that i
 
04:44:04.390 --> 04:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
recognize many people including many of
 
04:44:06.550 --> 04:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
my friends are comfortable with
 
04:44:08.310 --> 04:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
i am not
 
04:44:10.628 --> 04:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
and many of my friends are not
 
04:44:12.948 --> 04:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
and please do not marginalize me or my
 
04:44:12.958 --> 04:44:16.470 align:start position:0%
and please do not marginalize me or my
friends

04:44:16.470 --> 04:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:19.030 --> 04:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
you may respond if you wish if i have
 
04:44:22.390 --> 04:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
offended you sir i deeply apologize
 
04:44:24.708 --> 04:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
i suspect however that you know me well
 
04:44:27.270 --> 04:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
enough to understand that my community
 
04:44:30.150 --> 04:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
is extraordinarily diverse and i walk
 
04:44:32.070 --> 04:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
proudly and well with them
 
04:44:34.470 --> 04:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
but i thank you for the comment you did
 
04:44:36.390 --> 04:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
not have to say that sir because i've
 
04:44:38.230 --> 04:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
known that from almost the time i met
 
04:44:39.510 --> 04:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
you but thank you
 
04:44:42.550 --> 04:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
04:44:45.270 --> 04:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:44:45.280 --> 04:44:46.628 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
uh

04:44:46.628 --> 04:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:44:49.030 --> 04:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
now if our default is that we are
 
04:44:49.040 --> 04:44:50.788 align:start position:0%
now if our default is that we are
affirming

04:44:50.788 --> 04:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
affirming
 
04:44:52.788 --> 04:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
then that means
 
04:44:54.310 --> 04:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
it legally
 
04:44:57.190 --> 04:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
um and that we do not discriminate and
 
04:44:59.270 --> 04:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
we did hear testimony from an attorney
 
04:44:59.280 --> 04:45:00.390 align:start position:0%
we did hear testimony from an attorney
that

04:45:00.390 --> 04:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:45:02.150 --> 04:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
the way to determine if discrimination
 
04:45:04.868 --> 04:45:04.878 align:start position:0%
has occurred is by replacing
 
04:45:07.830 --> 04:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
the gender that one is identifying
 
04:45:09.430 --> 04:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
with and
 
04:45:12.390 --> 04:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
so if a student wants to participate in
 
04:45:15.670 --> 04:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
girls sports and he is biologically male
 
04:45:18.708 --> 04:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
but identifies as female if you changed
 
04:45:18.718 --> 04:45:20.150 align:start position:0%
but identifies as female if you changed
his

04:45:20.150 --> 04:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
his
 
04:45:20.160 --> 04:45:21.110 align:start position:0%
his
uh

04:45:21.110 --> 04:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:45:23.910 --> 04:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
what he wants to do to the other gender
 
04:45:26.948 --> 04:45:26.958 align:start position:0%
and would that still fly then no it's
 
04:45:30.868 --> 04:45:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:33.270 --> 04:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
so but if if we are
 
04:45:37.270 --> 04:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
in the position where schools believe in
 
04:45:40.868 --> 04:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
sports regulatory bodies believe that
 
04:45:44.470 --> 04:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
they must default to affirming someone's
 
04:45:46.550 --> 04:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
um self-reported
 
04:45:48.390 --> 04:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
gender identity
 
04:45:48.400 --> 04:45:49.830 align:start position:0%
gender identity
then

04:45:49.830 --> 04:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:45:53.590 --> 04:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be possible for johnny who
 
04:45:55.110 --> 04:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
is a sprinter
 
04:45:55.120 --> 04:45:56.788 align:start position:0%
is a sprinter
but

04:45:56.788 --> 04:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:45:57.990 --> 04:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
can't make
 
04:46:00.550 --> 04:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
the final cut for track
 
04:46:04.150 --> 04:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
and is discouraged to then go and say
 
04:46:06.470 --> 04:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
well i'm going to identify as jane now
 
04:46:08.070 --> 04:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to join the girls track
 
04:46:08.080 --> 04:46:09.030 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to join the girls track
team

04:46:09.030 --> 04:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
team
 
04:46:10.948 --> 04:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
because now the default is that we have
 
04:46:14.150 --> 04:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
to affirm so in that situation we need
 
04:46:16.550 --> 04:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
to give on a case-by-case basis the
 
04:46:19.190 --> 04:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
ability for these bodies to make the
 
04:46:21.750 --> 04:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
determination if that is fair it's a
 
04:46:24.230 --> 04:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
balancing of rights it is not by any
 
04:46:27.350 --> 04:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
means to say that transgenders should
 
04:46:30.150 --> 04:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
not exist but there are scenarios where
 
04:46:32.470 --> 04:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
this can be abused or where it's just
 
04:46:35.430 --> 04:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
not appropriate especially if a boy is
 
04:46:38.390 --> 04:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
well developed through male puberty and
 
04:46:41.270 --> 04:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
possesses the the skeleton
 
04:46:43.750 --> 04:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
skeletal features and muscle features of
 
04:46:43.760 --> 04:46:44.550 align:start position:0%
skeletal features and muscle features of
a

04:46:44.550 --> 04:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:46:47.830 --> 04:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
nearly matured boy
 
04:46:50.150 --> 04:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
would be a scenario where i think
 
04:46:51.990 --> 04:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
the school or the
 
04:46:55.030 --> 04:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
sport regulating body has an interest of
 
04:46:57.510 --> 04:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
differentiating between biological sex
 
04:46:59.750 --> 04:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
and that is all that this does it does
 
04:47:01.590 --> 04:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
not say that in every situation they
 
04:47:03.510 --> 04:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
have to do that it doesn't even say that
 
04:47:05.750 --> 04:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
in any situation they have to it just
 
04:47:07.190 --> 04:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
says that they do have an interest and
 
04:47:09.750 --> 04:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
they don't have to default to
 
04:47:11.350 --> 04:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
um affirming
 
04:47:15.510 --> 04:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:17.430 --> 04:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to suggest that we draw this
 
04:47:19.670 --> 04:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
to a close because at this point no
 
04:47:22.628 --> 04:47:22.638 align:start position:0%
one's going to change anyone's mind but
 
04:47:24.868 --> 04:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
um i would like to give representative
 
04:47:31.350 --> 04:47:31.360 align:start position:0%

the um
 
04:47:42.830 --> 04:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
the document that i mentioned
 
04:47:46.868 --> 04:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
in the nhiaa addresses your issues they
 
04:47:48.788 --> 04:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
do flag that a student
 
04:47:48.798 --> 04:47:50.310 align:start position:0%
do flag that a student
can't

04:47:50.310 --> 04:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
can't
 
04:47:52.550 --> 04:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
change back and forth
 
04:47:56.708 --> 04:47:56.718 align:start position:0%
between male and female teams
 
04:47:58.470 --> 04:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
when they're in school especially in
 
04:48:00.628 --> 04:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
high school
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
i am not clear on their on their
 
04:48:05.990 --> 04:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
04:48:06.000 --> 04:48:07.750 align:start position:0%
definition of
of

04:48:07.750 --> 04:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:48:09.590 --> 04:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
whether they should be on hormones or
 
04:48:09.600 --> 04:48:11.270 align:start position:0%
whether they should be on hormones or
not

04:48:11.270 --> 04:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:48:13.990 --> 04:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
so there is work being done
 
04:48:15.910 --> 04:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
there is a recognition that there's a
 
04:48:15.920 --> 04:48:18.470 align:start position:0%
there is a recognition that there's a
difference

04:48:18.470 --> 04:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:21.270 --> 04:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
those policy organizations are working
 
04:48:23.190 --> 04:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
on it to address it
 
04:48:27.270 --> 04:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
our voices to those organizations
 
04:48:30.310 --> 04:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
to help make it better for all students
 
04:48:32.470 --> 04:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
is needed
 
04:48:34.628 --> 04:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
i don't think we should be making those
 
04:48:36.230 --> 04:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
decisions here
 
04:48:38.230 --> 04:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
i think we should be making them with
 
04:48:41.030 --> 04:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
the organizations who are charted to do
 
04:48:41.040 --> 04:48:41.750 align:start position:0%
the organizations who are charted to do
it

04:48:41.750 --> 04:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:48:43.510 --> 04:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
04:48:45.830 --> 04:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
without requiring
 
04:48:48.550 --> 04:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
state legislative efforts
 
04:48:51.430 --> 04:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
to control what they do
 
04:48:53.590 --> 04:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
if we put it in statute
 
04:48:55.670 --> 04:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
their hands will be tied
 
04:48:59.190 --> 04:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
they won't be able to change it
 
04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
when they should have the flexibility to
 
04:49:04.550 --> 04:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
work within the standards communities
 
04:49:06.868 --> 04:49:06.878 align:start position:0%

the cliff notes
 
04:51:29.350 --> 04:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
and then we'll decide if we wish
 
04:51:32.550 --> 04:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
maybe it may be a boot point i had heard
 
04:51:34.550 --> 04:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
from um
 
04:51:35.750 --> 04:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
kate oregon
 
04:51:36.788 --> 04:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:51:38.750 --> 04:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
speaker had ruled that the amendment on
 
04:51:42.070 --> 04:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
1437 was non-germane but then i heard
 
04:51:43.670 --> 04:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
that that has been changed that now has
 
04:51:45.670 --> 04:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
been ruled germane so we do not need to
 
04:51:47.830 --> 04:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
revisit it
 
04:51:49.670 --> 04:51:49.680 align:start position:0%

digital form that i was going to email
 
04:52:28.788 --> 04:52:28.798 align:start position:0%

another thing that might be helpful
 
04:52:58.788 --> 04:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
because we did i don't know maybe it's
 
04:53:00.708 --> 04:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
maybe this is going to be too cumbersome
 
04:53:02.230 --> 04:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
but just to make sure we haven't missed
 
04:53:03.750 --> 04:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
anything because you are under the gun
 
04:53:04.948 --> 04:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be easy for you to
 
04:53:06.788 --> 04:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
contact somebody tonight and say hey
 
04:53:08.550 --> 04:53:08.560 align:start position:0%

in the order in which our bills were a
 
04:53:15.030 --> 04:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
quick rundown of who's responsible for
 
04:53:16.868 --> 04:53:16.878 align:start position:0%

05:01:41.510 --> 05:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
an equation goes to zero what happens
 
05:01:56.948 --> 05:01:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:00.070 --> 05:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
science is a social
 
05:02:00.080 --> 05:02:01.430 align:start position:0%

05:02:21.670 --> 05:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
05:02:24.150 --> 05:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
just the epitome of this last
 
05:02:24.160 --> 05:02:33.750 align:start position:0%
just the epitome of this last
session

05:02:33.750 --> 05:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:36.070 --> 05:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
dare to have this discussion 20 years
 
05:02:36.080 --> 05:02:38.070 align:start position:0%
dare to have this discussion 20 years
ago

05:02:38.070 --> 05:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
ago
 
05:02:52.708 --> 05:02:52.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:54.390 --> 05:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
because of the impetus and because of
 
05:02:55.590 --> 05:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
the ignorance
 
05:02:57.110 --> 05:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
and i debated whether i should say
 
05:02:57.120 --> 05:02:59.350 align:start position:0%
and i debated whether i should say
something

05:02:59.350 --> 05:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:03:01.350 --> 05:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
and i decided people probably didn't
 
05:03:03.190 --> 05:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
want to hear me pontificate about they
 
05:03:05.270 --> 05:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
don't know about science but maybe i
 
05:03:06.390 --> 05:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
should have
 
05:03:06.400 --> 05:03:19.990 align:start position:0%
should have
and

05:03:19.990 --> 05:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:21.430 --> 05:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
every one of those individuals is a
 
05:03:21.440 --> 05:03:22.310 align:start position:0%
every one of those individuals is a
female

05:03:22.310 --> 05:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
female
 
05:03:24.150 --> 05:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes
 
05:03:26.470 --> 05:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
it's only if
 
05:03:26.480 --> 05:03:27.590 align:start position:0%
it's only if
if

05:03:27.590 --> 05:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:03:31.510 --> 05:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:34.788 --> 05:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
regardless of what genetics is right
 
05:03:34.798 --> 05:03:35.830 align:start position:0%
regardless of what genetics is right
so

05:03:35.830 --> 05:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:03:37.670 --> 05:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
just take that now
 
05:03:37.680 --> 05:03:38.470 align:start position:0%
just take that now
well

05:03:38.470 --> 05:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:03:40.230 --> 05:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
we can still tell
 
05:03:42.390 --> 05:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
no you can't
 
05:03:44.550 --> 05:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
you may remember dick osbourne gave me
 
05:03:44.560 --> 05:03:48.830 align:start position:0%
you may remember dick osbourne gave me
examples

05:03:48.830 --> 05:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:53.670 --> 05:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
um this was his story and i repaired
 
05:03:55.270 --> 05:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
a commandant
 
05:04:31.830 --> 05:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:31.840 --> 05:04:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:04:41.030 --> 05:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:42.150 --> 05:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
so when you say just look at the
 
05:04:44.390 --> 05:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
waterworks you know the doctor can tell
 
05:04:44.400 --> 05:05:24.310 align:start position:0%
waterworks you know the doctor can tell
you

05:05:24.310 --> 05:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
