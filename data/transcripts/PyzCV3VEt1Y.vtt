honorable colleagues I rise in
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB 497.
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
this bill represents a fundamental
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding of how dcyf case
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
records are accessed by parents wishing
 
00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
a copy of their completed dcyf case File
 
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
currently state law requires dcyf to
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
release records to parents within a
 
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
certain time frame upon request
 
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of dcyf is allowed to
 
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
retain records if releasing them would
 
00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:57.660 align:start position:0%
cause harm to a child this is done only
 
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
when there is a concurrent criminal
 
00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:04.019 align:start position:0%
investigation about those exact same
 
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:07.220 align:start position:0%
allegations in those circumstances
 
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
releasing these those records would
 
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
interfere with the law enforcement
 
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.329 align:start position:0%
interfere with the law enforcement
investigation

00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:14.339 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to take that decision
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
out of the hands of the police and the
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
dcyf commissioner and instead require
 
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
dcyf to petition family court and have a
 
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
family court judge decide if releasing
 
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
those records would impact the police
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
investigation putting aside the fact
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
that criminal matters are not under the
 
00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
purview of the family court system we
 
00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:39.899 align:start position:0%
know that the family court receives 127
 
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
000 new cases each calendar year were
 
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
this bill to be enacted dcyf could no
 
00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
longer simply send a letter to a parent
 
00:12:50.449 --> 00:12:50.459 align:start position:0%
saying that those records are being
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
retained and why instead they would have
 
00:12:56.449 --> 00:12:56.459 align:start position:0%
to file a petition and family court wait
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
for a hearing date and then explain the
 
00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
situation to a family court judge we
 
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
know that getting a hearing date in
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
Family Court takes months
 
00:13:08.449 --> 00:13:08.459 align:start position:0%
currently a parent can get that letter
 
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
from dcyf much more quickly and then if
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
they disagree with the decision appeal
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
the decision to either the dcyf
 
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman or the independent Office of
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
the child advocate current law allows
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
families to find out what the
 
00:13:26.449 --> 00:13:26.459 align:start position:0%
disposition of their request is much
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
more quickly than this bill would allow
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
I understand the frustration that
 
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:35.180 align:start position:0%
families feel when records are delayed
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
dcyf clearly has a staffing problem
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
but one could argue that the family
 
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
court system Staffing problems are worse
 
00:13:47.569 --> 00:13:47.579 align:start position:0%
logically this bill would further muddle
 
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
the process instead of streamlining it
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
current statute dictates that the
 
00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
division of children youth and families
 
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
shall release case records to certain
 
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
individuals and parties
 
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.810 align:start position:0%
individuals and parties
unless

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
unless
 
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
the harm to the child from the release
 
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
of those records outweighs
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
so far so good I think we can all agree
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
that releasing such information
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
if it is harmful to the child is a bad
 
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.009 align:start position:0%
if it is harmful to the child is a bad
thing

00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:34.019 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:38.220 align:start position:0%
who makes that decision
 
00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
who decides whether the harm to the
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
child outweighs the need to disclose
 
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
such information
 
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
well according to statute it is the
 
00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:48.180 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Health and Human
 
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.310 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Health and Human
Services

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
or her designee
 
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
so for practical purposes that means
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
that dcyf makes the decision
 
00:14:59.689 --> 00:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not the harm to the
 
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.220 align:start position:0%
child outweighs the need to disclose
 
00:15:05.329 --> 00:15:05.339 align:start position:0%
and dcyf determines whether they made
 
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
four decisions this important
 
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
it only makes sense to have reasonable
 
00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
these decisions dramatically impact
 
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
people's lives consider the example
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
of a family of a parent or parents
 
00:15:30.769 --> 00:15:30.779 align:start position:0%
who've been accused of wrongdoing
 
00:15:32.569 --> 00:15:32.579 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution part
 
00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
first Article 15 pertains to the rights
 
00:15:37.009 --> 00:15:37.019 align:start position:0%
of the accused
 
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
and among other things it says that you
 
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
have a right to be presented with the
 
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
the current system
 
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
arguably violates that section of the
 
00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.230 align:start position:0%
arguably violates that section of the
Constitution

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
but accused parents are not the only
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
ones affected by this divorced or
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
separated parents likewise may be
 
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
seeking information
 
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
and we do know of cases where there are
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
civil cases
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
where information has been withheld
 
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
under this statute so it is not just
 
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
criminal cases
 
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
this bill established reason establishes
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable checks and balances
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
if dcyf believes that they
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
that the harm to the child outweighs the
 
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
need to disclose the information
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
they can simply petition the court
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
to issue a stay until a final decision
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
is made
 
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
creates reasonable checks and balances
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
and I urge my colleagues to press the
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
green button
 
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:45.060 align:start position:0%

it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.580 --> 00:18:00.650 align:start position:0%

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is ought to pass on
 
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
House Bill 497. this is a roll call vote
 
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative long for
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know House Bill 497
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
would create a long awaiting period for
 
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
parents and Guardians to go through this
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
process and I know that records such as
 
00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:49.580 align:start position:0%
pediatricians and therapists are not
 
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
dcyf's records and this bill would
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
create unintended consequences would I
 
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:56.100 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker if I know due process is a
 
00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
critical part of both our civil and our
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice System Mr Speaker if I
 
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
know that checks and balances on a
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
department is a good thing
 
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker lastly if I know that
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%

00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
every single bill that we have on the
 
00:22:59.930 --> 00:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
calendar today I think except one has a
 
00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.330 align:start position:0%
calendar today I think except one has a
debate

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
so the more you can stay in your seats
 
00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure robly almost every single
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
one will be a division or a roll call
 
00:23:12.649 --> 00:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
so the more you stay in your seats the
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
quicker we can get done
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
we lose about an hour a day
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
when we ask for a roll call or a
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
division and we have to wait for people
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
to come in
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
so if you will cooperate we'll get done
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
maybe about an hour earlier thank you
 
00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
representative Muse moves Auto pass
 
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 76 the committee on
 
00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:38.820 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and Public Safety to
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
which was referred House Bill 76 posing
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
a waiting period between the purchase
 
00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
and delivery of a firearm comes to us
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
without recommendation
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
and vice representative moves ought to
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
pass chair recognize representative

Rhodes

00:23:57.649 --> 00:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker House Bill 76
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
says anybody that goes in to purchase a
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
firearm has to wait three days in order
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
00:24:10.669 --> 00:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
during committee we heard exactly what
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
you'd think we would hear we heard about
 
00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:15.059 align:start position:0%
people that commit suicide or people
 
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
that are going to do or have intention
 
00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
to create great harm
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
and that's all very sad and nobody wants
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
that to happen
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
so the bill says don't worry we got you
 
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
if you're a hunter and you took your
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
hunting course
 
00:24:30.049 --> 00:24:30.059 align:start position:0%
it doesn't doesn't apply to you you
 
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about that but it
 
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't say you know when you had to
 
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
have taken the course or if there's a
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
waiting period to take that course
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
it says if you're in law enforcement
 
00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:42.059 align:start position:0%
don't worry it doesn't apply to you
 
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
it says if you are active duty military
 
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anything about if you're a
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
veteran just active duty
 
00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:51.299 align:start position:0%
and my personal favorite
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
if a woman expresses fear to her local
 
00:24:57.409 --> 00:24:57.419 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer
 
00:24:59.690 --> 00:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
so I brought this up in committee and I
 
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
said you know this doesn't work for me I
 
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
no I don't think that we're going to
 
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
tell a woman that she has to wait three
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
days to protect herself
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
and then I went back and I clarified and
 
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
I said I do recognize that it says here
 
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
that if a woman goes to her local law
 
00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:18.780 align:start position:0%
enforcement and expresses fear that she
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to wait three days
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
but I also said it doesn't say how you
 
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
express that fear are you supposed to
 
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
just say hey I'm afraid you're supposed
 
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
to fill out a form exactly what are we
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
supposed to do
 
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
then there was a local newspaper that
 
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
did a really nice gotcha hook on a
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
headline that said representative
 
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
refuses to care
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay and it said
 
00:25:48.289 --> 00:25:48.299 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes throughout the
 
00:25:48.299 --> 00:25:49.370 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes throughout the
typical

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
typical
 
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
Damsel in Distress card
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
let me explain to you what a damsel in
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
distress is
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
a damsel in distress says
 
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
a woman
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
that is waiting for a man to come save
 
00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:10.730 align:start position:0%
that is waiting for a man to come save
her

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:13.740 align:start position:0%
I will not
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
go to my local law enforcement
 
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
and beg for permission
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
for my god-given right to defend myself
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
now or three days from now
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
and when you
 
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
house will be in order when you can
 
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
figure out how to get an abusive man or
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
a rapist to take a three-day cooling
 
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
down period which I think is highly
 
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
unlikely because we can't even get them
 
00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
to have to stay in jail for three days
 
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
and see a judge
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
until that day I will continue to
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
protect myself thank you very much thank
 
00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
I recognize representative Muse
 
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
a roll call has been requested it is has
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
been sufficiently seconded this will be
 
00:26:58.850 --> 00:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote and we're on our final
 
00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.490 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote and we're on our final
speaker

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.169 --> 00:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
um this is actually a simple bill that
 
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:07.140 align:start position:0%
would establish a three-day waiting
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
period between the time a firearm is
 
00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:11.700 align:start position:0%
sold and between the time a new owner
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
can actually pick it up
 
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh the bill won't create a situation uh
 
00:27:18.289 --> 00:27:18.299 align:start position:0%
we're a three-day waiting period turns
 
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
into a four or five or six day waiting
 
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
period uh because uh we're talking about
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
calendar days uh not business days
 
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
under both current state and federal law
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
no waiting period is required to
 
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
purchase a firearm by passing uh this
 
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
bill we'd be changing that at the New
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire level and we'd also be doing a
 
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
couple of very important things
 
00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
a waiting period would give Law
 
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers extra time to
 
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
perform an accurate background check to
 
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're keeping Firearms
 
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
out of the hands of a person who
 
00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
actually shouldn't have one
 
00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
but more importantly what it does is it
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
creates a cooling off period to reduce
 
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
the risk of a violent act or a suicide
 
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.850 align:start position:0%
the risk of a violent act or a suicide
attempt

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
attempt
 
00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:03.539 align:start position:0%
so in New Hampshire
 
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
we have a small problem when it comes to
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
homicides by firearm but we have a very
 
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
large problem when it comes to suicides
 
00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
by firearm according to the chief
 
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
medical examiner in 2020
 
00:28:21.289 --> 00:28:21.299 align:start position:0%
91 percent of New Hampshire's firearms
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
deaths that's 118 out of 129 were
 
00:28:25.919 --> 00:28:27.649 align:start position:0%
deaths that's 118 out of 129 were
suicides

00:28:27.649 --> 00:28:27.659 align:start position:0%
suicides
 
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
um one of the other things that we know
 
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
is that your chances of succeeding in a
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
suicide if you use a firearm you your
 
00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
the odds are you're going to be about 91
 
00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:42.200 align:start position:0%
successful so unlike other forums uh
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
other types of ways or other ways to
 
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
take your own life taking your life by
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
firearm is something that is more likely
 
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
than not to prove fatal
 
00:28:57.789 --> 00:28:57.799 align:start position:0%
um we would be the first to tell you
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
that this is not going to end firearm
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
suicide or gun violence in the state of
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but what it will do is
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
help reduce the risk of suicide and some
 
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
of these uh impulsive acts by people who
 
00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
really could benefit from a cooling off
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
period And if like me if you've sat in
 
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
in public hearings and this didn't
 
00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:24.539 align:start position:0%
happen on this particular bill but it
 
00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:27.380 align:start position:0%
happened on one like it and you've heard
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
from mothers who
 
00:29:33.169 --> 00:29:33.179 align:start position:0%
have had kids in that situation and had
 
00:29:36.769 --> 00:29:36.779 align:start position:0%
a child actually go to a gun shop buy a
 
00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:39.980 align:start position:0%
firearm and then commit suicide
 
00:29:42.889 --> 00:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
you wonder what kind of a difference
 
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
would a three-day waiting period have
 
00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:48.059 align:start position:0%
meant in the mind of a of a troubled
 
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.850 align:start position:0%
 
laughs

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:52.860 align:start position:0%
laughs
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the exceptions of that HB
 
00:29:59.090 --> 00:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
76 adds
 
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
um that uh that the representative went
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
over in the majority report or in her
 
00:30:05.279 --> 00:30:07.010 align:start position:0%
over in the majority report or in her
report

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:07.730 align:start position:0%
report
um

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I would like to
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
say is that many of those are the
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
product of actually having talked to and
 
00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
listened to people on the other side of
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
the aisle who have another point of view
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
about these issues that's why those
 
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
exceptions are in there
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
and one of the things I think that's
 
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
very important to realize about this
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
bill is we're not putting people in a
 
00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
situation where if they've been
 
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
threatened or if they're being protected
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
if they're being if they're under the
 
00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
protection of a protective order where
 
00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
they would not be able to get a firearm
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
that's why these exceptions are in there
 
00:30:43.799 --> 00:30:44.630 align:start position:0%
that's why these exceptions are in there
um

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
another argument that we hear all the
 
00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:48.419 align:start position:0%
time about these bills is that they're
 
00:30:48.419 --> 00:30:49.970 align:start position:0%
time about these bills is that they're
unconstitutional

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
00:30:51.889 --> 00:30:51.899 align:start position:0%
and then in a system that prizes
 
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
individual rights any attempt to balance
 
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
an individual right with Public Safety
 
00:30:59.450 --> 00:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
or or any social concern flies in the
 
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
face of what the founding fathers
 
00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.090 align:start position:0%
face of what the founding fathers
intended

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
intended
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
and that might be a winning argument if
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
the founding fathers had actually
 
00:31:09.649 --> 00:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
stopped at listing rights when they
 
00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:10.980 align:start position:0%
wrote both our state and federal
 
00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:13.490 align:start position:0%
wrote both our state and federal
Constitution

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
is not what they did
 
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
they also outlined a system to make and
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
enforce laws and they did this because
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
they wisely recognized that they needed
 
00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
ways to balance and peacefully settle
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
conflicts between individuals who are
 
00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
exercising their rights
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
at every level of government we have
 
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
laws that rightly and correctly place
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
limits on individual actions we have
 
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech but not the freedom to
 
00:31:42.769 --> 00:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
libel we have freedom to practice our
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
religion but not to force others to
 
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
practice it we have the right to keep
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
and bear arms but not to use them to
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
harm or to threaten others
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
Central to both our state and federal
 
00:31:57.049 --> 00:31:57.059 align:start position:0%
Constitution is the idea that in a civil
 
00:31:59.930 --> 00:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
society individual rights cannot be
 
00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.310 align:start position:0%
society individual rights cannot be
absolute

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
absolute
 
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
in other words to protect Public Safety
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
and avoid creating a society where
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
literally anything goes the rights of
 
00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
individuals must be balanced against the
 
00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
rights of others
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
first two articles of our own New
 
00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bill of Rights are very clear
 
00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
about the natural rights that we have as
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
Citizens including the right to bear
 
00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.549 align:start position:0%
Citizens including the right to bear
arms

00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
arms
 
00:32:24.889 --> 00:32:24.899 align:start position:0%
but strategically placed by our founding
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
fathers directly underneath them is
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
article 3.
 
00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
article 3 could not be more clear when
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
it comes to our duty to balance the
 
00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
rights of individuals with the rights of
 
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.529 align:start position:0%
rights of individuals with the rights of
others

00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:36.539 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
it reads in part when men enter into a
 
00:32:42.049 --> 00:32:42.059 align:start position:0%
state of society they surrender up some
 
00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
of their natural rights to that Society
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
in order to ensure the protection of
 
00:32:47.159 --> 00:32:48.529 align:start position:0%
in order to ensure the protection of
others

00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:48.539 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
so while there are many things we might
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
call HB 76
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
one thing that we cannot call it is an
 
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
affront to the Constitution
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do is take one
 
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
small step towards reducing the risk of
 
00:33:03.529 --> 00:33:03.539 align:start position:0%
gun violence and suicide in New
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and bring us back into a
 
00:33:09.289 --> 00:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
proper balance between respect for the
 
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
rights of individuals to own firearms
 
00:33:15.529 --> 00:33:15.539 align:start position:0%
and our responsibility to ensure the
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
protection of others
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
so please vote with me vote green to
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
support the ought to Pat motion for HB
 
00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.810 align:start position:0%
support the ought to Pat motion for HB
76

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
76
 
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
thank you as a member yield the
 
00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:29.090 align:start position:0%
thank you as a member yield the
questions

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:31.580 align:start position:0%
sure remember yields
 
00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr Speaker and thank you
 
00:33:38.529 --> 00:33:38.539 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the part one article 3 of
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
The Constitution and the word others
 
00:33:46.009 --> 00:33:46.019 align:start position:0%
isn't it possible that the word others
 
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
means other natural rights rather than
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
other people as you are assuming
 
00:33:54.169 --> 00:33:54.179 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that's the way it's been
 
00:33:54.179 --> 00:33:55.430 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that's the way it's been
interpreted

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
interpreted
 
00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.110 align:start position:0%
interpreted
um

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:02.220 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is ought to pass on
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
House Bill 76 this is going to be a roll
 
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:52.730 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
motion before us is ought to pass in
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
House Bill 76 this is a roll call vote
 
00:34:59.089 --> 00:34:59.099 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Roy for
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
a parliamentary inquiry
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
if I know
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
while discussing the founding fathers
 
00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
that Paul Revere did not say The British
 
00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
are coming in three days
 
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
and if I know
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
that a right delayed is a right denied
 
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Speaker if I know a woman
 
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
should never have to ask a man for
 
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
permission to defend herself would I
 
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
press the red button and overturn the
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
ought to pass so another motion can be
 
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.349 align:start position:0%
ought to pass so another motion can be
made

00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:32.099 align:start position:0%
see I recognize representative Newman
 
00:35:43.609 --> 00:35:43.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:35:50.329 --> 00:35:50.339 align:start position:0%
correct correction my apologies Mr Mr
 
00:35:50.339 --> 00:35:52.490 align:start position:0%
correct correction my apologies Mr Mr
Speaker

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
if I know that a brief waiting period
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
that this bill provides can prevent
 
00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.609 align:start position:0%
that this bill provides can prevent
suicide

00:35:58.609 --> 00:35:58.619 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
by providing a cooling off period to a
 
00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:02.940 align:start position:0%
troubled person who impulsively wants to
 
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
fire to
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
purchase a firearm to commit suicide
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
and if I know that 90 of suicide
 
00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
survivors do not go on to die by Suicide
 
00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:20.420 align:start position:0%
but because of the lethality of firearms
 
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
85 percent of people who use guns to
 
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
commit suicide will not get that second
 
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.829 align:start position:0%
commit suicide will not get that second
chance

00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
chance
 
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
and finally that if I know that people
 
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
who need quick access to firearms for
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
self-defense are exempt from the waiting
 
00:36:40.609 --> 00:36:40.619 align:start position:0%
period if they have a restraining order
 
00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:43.740 align:start position:0%
or they express their reasonable fear
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
for their personal safety to a law
 
00:36:47.089 --> 00:36:47.099 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer and you can express
 
00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:49.460 align:start position:0%
it to any law enforcement officer
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
anytime you are exempt from the
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
three-day waiting period so don't worry
 
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:56.099 align:start position:0%
about Paul Revere
 
00:36:58.130 --> 00:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
would I now pass this completely
 
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
constitutional gun Suicide Prevention
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
bill that is supported by 85 percent of
 
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:07.740 align:start position:0%
non-gun owners and 72 percent of gun
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
owners by pressing the green button and
 
00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:14.180 align:start position:0%
I do have references for any percentages
 
00:37:16.849 --> 00:37:16.859 align:start position:0%

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:03.380 align:start position:0%
House Bill 89 as we just amended it
 
00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
recognizes that there are three branches
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
of the state government one the governor
 
00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:10.619 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary
 
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
and this house oh I'm sorry the General
 
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
Court House and Senate
 
00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
the governor we recognize can pardon he
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
has the sole power to pardon
 
00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:25.380 align:start position:0%
and the court has the sole power of
 
00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
annulling a conviction
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
with this bill as amended would do is to
 
00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
recognize that the general court would
 
00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:37.220 align:start position:0%
have the ability to posthumously
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
exonerate somebody
 
00:40:41.569 --> 00:40:41.579 align:start position:0%
and what does that mean
 
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
that means that
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
over time
 
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
this the general court recognizes that I
 
00:40:53.329 --> 00:40:53.339 align:start position:0%
manifest Injustice of the law or policy
 
00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:56.220 align:start position:0%
has happened by a conviction
 
00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
so also in the bill are two individuals
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
that our committee and I think you've
 
00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
seen this bill and heard this bill many
 
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
times in the past if you've been in the
 
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
house for many years
 
00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
that have definitely had a
 
00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:15.380 align:start position:0%
bad rap
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
one being
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
goody coal Eunice Cole of Hampton now
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
back when she was put before the court
 
00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
and convicted of
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire didn't exist
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
it was the province of New Hampshire but
 
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
at the time when a it
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
also now known as Hampton was actually a
 
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
Township that was
 
00:41:50.089 --> 00:41:50.099 align:start position:0%
put together by the Commonwealth of
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and not by New Hampshire
 
00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:54.740 align:start position:0%
because the the Mason Grant wasn't
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
enforced so
 
00:41:58.609 --> 00:41:58.619 align:start position:0%
what happened when she was put before
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
the court was she was dragged into
 
00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.329 align:start position:0%
the court was she was dragged into
Massachusetts

00:42:01.329 --> 00:42:01.339 align:start position:0%

there

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
we recognized that
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
there was a scare in Salem Massachusetts
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
about witches and and we realized that
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
you know what we were wrong
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
and through this bill we're going to say
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
we're sorry
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%

00:47:01.849 --> 00:47:01.859 align:start position:0%
okay so why not include it
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
these compounds are not addictive
 
00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:13.140 align:start position:0%
these compounds are not habit forming
 
00:47:16.849 --> 00:47:16.859 align:start position:0%
these compounds have the unique
 
00:47:16.859 --> 00:47:19.490 align:start position:0%
these compounds have the unique
characteristic

00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
characteristic
 
00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:23.460 align:start position:0%
that if you use them on a regular basis
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
the effect is diminished
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
and if you're chasing the high
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
and you take more
 
00:47:35.329 --> 00:47:35.339 align:start position:0%
you don't get the high
 
00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
a tolerance is quickly established and
 
00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:42.839 align:start position:0%
the only way to get the high back
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
is to wait
 
00:47:47.809 --> 00:47:47.819 align:start position:0%
to let your body go back to equilibrium
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
but wait so it's self-controlling but
 
00:47:52.809 --> 00:47:52.819 align:start position:0%
wait there's more
 
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
unlike dangerous drugs
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
drugs that we should not legalize like
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
amphetamines like barbiturates like
 
00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:05.390 align:start position:0%
amphetamines like barbiturates like
narcotics

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.849 --> 00:48:10.859 align:start position:0%
these compounds are non-toxic
 
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
in fact LSD has no ld50
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
what's an ld50 you ask ld50 is the
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
amount of substance that you give to a
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
general population that kills half of
 
00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:23.930 align:start position:0%
general population that kills half of
them

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:48:28.329 --> 00:48:28.339 align:start position:0%
alcohol has an ld50 heroin has an ld50
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
cocaine has an ld50
 
00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
LSD has no ld50 the only way to kill
 
00:48:38.569 --> 00:48:38.579 align:start position:0%
somebody with LSD would be to
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
crystallize enough of it and drop it on
 
00:48:44.329 --> 00:48:44.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
it's a fact
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.809 --> 00:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
I sympathize
 
00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:52.740 align:start position:0%
with Junkies
 
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
I sympathize with people that sympathize
 
00:48:56.809 --> 00:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
with Junkies
 
00:48:58.970 --> 00:48:58.980 align:start position:0%
and I want to get them the help they
 
00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.270 align:start position:0%
and I want to get them the help they
need

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
psychedelics have been shown and proven
 
00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
to be effective in the treatment of
 
00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:13.609 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:49:13.609 --> 00:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous in
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
the 1950s used LSD to great effect to
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
if you wanna If You Wanna Stop drug
 
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
addiction in this country then you need
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
to join me in voting red to overturn the
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
itl so that another motion can be made
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is common sense these
 
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
compounds were swept up into the world
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
of illegality back in the 1960s
 
00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
as a knee-jerk reaction
 
00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
we all know the CIA
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
under MK Ultra
 
00:49:59.930 --> 00:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
tried using psychedelics as mind control
 
00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
drugs didn't work they tried to use it
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
as truth serum drugs it didn't work do
 
00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
you know what these compounds produce
 
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you what they produce they
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
produce pea snacks
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
they produce peaceness and you know what
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
the government was not interested in in
 
00:50:18.589 --> 00:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
the early mid and late 1960s was
 
00:50:18.599 --> 00:50:20.089 align:start position:0%
the early mid and late 1960s was
peacenix

00:50:20.089 --> 00:50:20.099 align:start position:0%
peacenix
 
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
and that's why these compounds were
 
00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:26.220 align:start position:0%
swept up into the to the drug laws was
 
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
to prevent making young people into
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
peace next because they wanted people to
 
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
go into southeast Asia and kill other
 
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.670 align:start position:0%
go into southeast Asia and kill other
people

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
that's why I filed this bill this is
 
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
good Common Sense legislation I don't
 
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
want these compounds to be legal
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative Virgo okay God bless you
 
00:50:47.569 --> 00:50:47.579 align:start position:0%
it won't be these compounds will not be
 
00:50:47.579 --> 00:50:49.549 align:start position:0%
it won't be these compounds will not be
legal

00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
legal
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
they won't be illegal in New Hampshire
 
00:50:54.049 --> 00:50:54.059 align:start position:0%
but federally they will still be illegal
 
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
and controlled compounds if the feds
 
00:50:58.609 --> 00:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
really want to go and police this then
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
let them police it
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
okay when is the last time we had a big
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
psychedelics bust in New Hampshire I I
 
00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
asked the narcotics Chief from the state
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
police that that question when he came
 
00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:15.300 align:start position:0%
to testify against this bill
 
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
he had an interesting answer
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
he said I I don't know I'm not aware of
 
00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.890 align:start position:0%
he said I I don't know I'm not aware of
one

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:23.089 align:start position:0%
one
but

00:51:23.089 --> 00:51:23.099 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
oh there's a butt
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
but my kids are in high school
 
00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
and they say mushrooms are everywhere
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
all the kids that want them have them
 
00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
and they're doing them
 
00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:36.290 align:start position:0%
and they're doing them
so

00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
so the prohibition is completely
 
00:51:41.569 --> 00:51:41.579 align:start position:0%
ineffective and because we we make it a
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
boogie man kids are interested in it
 
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:47.220 align:start position:0%
right if you wanna if you want to help
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
people that have drug problems work with
 
00:51:52.849 --> 00:51:52.859 align:start position:0%
me to get these compounds back to
 
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:55.140 align:start position:0%
availability so that we can treat people
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
I ask you I beg you press the red button
 
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
let's overturn the itl so another motion
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
could be made and so we can actually
 
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
help people thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:52:08.089 --> 00:52:08.099 align:start position:0%
representative William Walsh has
 
00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
requested a wall call it is sufficiently
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
seconded we're down to our last speaker
 
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
I agree with much of what my colleague
 
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
just said
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
with regard to to the part about um you
 
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
need to drop it on someone's head uh in
 
00:52:32.569 --> 00:52:32.579 align:start position:0%
a mass amount to kill them there's
 
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:34.380 align:start position:0%
another way to make it lethal and that's
 
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:37.140 align:start position:0%
to give it to a 17 year old and put him
 
00:52:38.569 --> 00:52:38.579 align:start position:0%
behind the wheel of a five thousand
 
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
pound car
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
and he thinks that someone's a dragon
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
and runs them over
 
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's a psychedelic it Alters your
 
00:52:49.609 --> 00:52:49.619 align:start position:0%
perception of reality
 
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
maybe it's helpful matter of fact it
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
probably is helpful in certain
 
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:55.140 align:start position:0%
controlled circumstances
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
but to just turn it loose on the public
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
where anyone can have access to it now
 
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
the bill says 21 and over we know good
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
and well that somehow miners find a way
 
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
to get things that are only for 21 and
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
over otherwise we wouldn't have alcohol
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
problems with teenagers
 
00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:14.220 align:start position:0%
so to turn this loose on the public with
 
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
no control
 
00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
is very dangerous
 
00:53:21.790 --> 00:53:21.800 align:start position:0%
we cannot tell if someone right now is
 
00:53:24.049 --> 00:53:24.059 align:start position:0%
inebriated on marijuana when they're
 
00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:26.460 align:start position:0%
driving how in Earth will we tell if
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
someone has taken LSD there's no test
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
furthermore LSD is
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
a substance that stays in your system
 
00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:37.980 align:start position:0%
for a while it's stored in your fat
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
cells and it can be reactivated at any
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
time there's scientific proof of people
 
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
having a new experience days or weeks
 
00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
after they've taken the drug so they
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
don't know when it's going to hit they
 
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
could take it feel better and then
 
00:53:54.049 --> 00:53:54.059 align:start position:0%
a day or two later while they're
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
operating a machine it comes back
 
00:53:58.490 --> 00:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
so there's a this is a dangerous
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
substance to be given to someone without
 
00:54:05.329 --> 00:54:05.339 align:start position:0%
experience with it under no control
 
00:54:08.569 --> 00:54:08.579 align:start position:0%
and as I said if it has medical benefits
 
00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
it should come back as a medical bill
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
but to just cut it loose on the public
 
00:54:14.329 --> 00:54:14.339 align:start position:0%
is a dangerous proposition
 
00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
and I would ask you to oh one final
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
thing if you want marijuana legal in the
 
00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:20.089 align:start position:0%
thing if you want marijuana legal in the
state

00:54:20.089 --> 00:54:20.099 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
it's best not to do this at the same
 
00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:22.790 align:start position:0%
it's best not to do this at the same
time

00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
the federal government has been turning
 
00:54:26.809 --> 00:54:26.819 align:start position:0%
a blind eye to States legalizing
 
00:54:26.819 --> 00:54:28.190 align:start position:0%
a blind eye to States legalizing
marijuana

00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
how far do you want to push that before
 
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
they start cracking down and we start
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
legalizing everything then they're going
 
00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
to turn and they're going to say wait a
 
00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
minute and put the brakes on it all and
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
you'll jeopardize that as well
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
so it's up to you to choose but I would
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
ask for you to support the committee's
 
00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:46.140 align:start position:0%

00:55:52.609 --> 00:55:52.619 align:start position:0%
not look good for me
 
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
but also Mr Speaker if I know
 
00:55:59.569 --> 00:55:59.579 align:start position:0%
that LSD flashbacks are a myth
 
00:56:02.569 --> 00:56:02.579 align:start position:0%
and that LSD does not reside in your fat
 
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
cells for indeterminate amount of times
 
00:56:07.609 --> 00:56:07.619 align:start position:0%
and the metabolism of LSD is about 6 to
 
00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
12 hours in the human body

influence of psychedelics today
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
and making it legal in New Hampshire is
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
not going to make that happen and Mr
 
00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:30.380 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I also know this is only for
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%

00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:35.880 align:start position:0%

00:59:21.049 --> 00:59:21.059 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
back again for my second favorite topic
 
00:59:28.849 --> 00:59:28.859 align:start position:0%
so several years ago
 
00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
I was lucky enough to be a member of
 
00:59:33.049 --> 00:59:33.059 align:start position:0%
this body and we voted to decriminalize
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
three-quarters of an ounce of marijuana
 
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
and guess what happened
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
it passed passed the governor vetoed it
 
00:59:46.849 --> 00:59:46.859 align:start position:0%
sad day and then it came back to the
 
00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
House and Senate and we overrode The
 
00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:50.700 align:start position:0%
veto good day
 
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
you know what's really interesting is
 
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
since that happened
 
00:59:56.809 --> 00:59:56.819 align:start position:0%
the sky
 
00:59:59.690 --> 00:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
did not fall
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
I know shocking right Sky did not fall
 
01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
six years well almost seven now in this
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
this August body
 
01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
and one thing I've learned
 
01:00:15.289 --> 01:00:15.299 align:start position:0%
we like simple bills
 
01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
We Like Short bills when bills get
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
complicated when they get long and they
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
get confusing people vote against them
 
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
this is the shortest easiest way to
 
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
affect the change that the majority of
 
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
our constituents want and that is the
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
legalization of cannabis
 
01:00:37.319 --> 01:00:39.710 align:start position:0%
legalization of cannabis
right

01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
I also know from my years in this body
 
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:45.780 align:start position:0%
that taxation is theft
 
01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
and this bill does not have
 
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
the carrot
 
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
of Revenue
 
01:00:57.289 --> 01:00:57.299 align:start position:0%
just because we allow people to do
 
01:00:57.299 --> 01:00:58.670 align:start position:0%
just because we allow people to do
something

01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that the state has to get
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
a cut of the action
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
why don't we
 
01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
finally step up to the plate
 
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
fully decriminalize marijuana in New
 
01:01:16.849 --> 01:01:16.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for consenting adults
 
01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:19.740 align:start position:0%
why don't we keep the state out of the
 
01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:25.010 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
does anybody run numbers in New
 
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire anymore
 
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
now you know why because we let the
 
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
state run numbers that's what the
 
01:01:35.329 --> 01:01:35.339 align:start position:0%
lottery is the the lotteries is a number
 
01:01:35.339 --> 01:01:36.650 align:start position:0%
lottery is the the lotteries is a number
scam

01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
scam
 
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
for those of you that don't like the
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
drug industry the drug business
 
01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
fair enough I'm not really a big fan
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
either believe it or not
 
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
then why would you want to put the
 
01:01:50.809 --> 01:01:50.819 align:start position:0%
government in charge of the racket
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
cut the government out of the racket so
 
01:01:56.569 --> 01:01:56.579 align:start position:0%
let's do what the vast majority in New
 
01:01:58.849 --> 01:01:58.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens want us to do and
 
01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
that is finally decriminalize marijuana
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
and so I ask you to press the red button
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
overturn the itl so that another more
 
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
common sense motion can be made thank
 
01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.569 --> 01:02:26.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:31.740 align:start position:0%

uh

01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
we have multiple bills attempting to
 
01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
legalize cannabis
 
01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
we've been at this for years and still
 
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
struggling to get it done the people of
 
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
favor legalization so far we have failed
 
01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:50.329 align:start position:0%
favor legalization so far we have failed
them

01:02:50.329 --> 01:02:50.339 align:start position:0%

01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
many of my colleagues are resting their
 
01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:53.900 align:start position:0%
hopes on the passage of the bipartisan
 
01:02:57.890 --> 01:02:57.900 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization Bill HB 639 and
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
I'm in support of that one as well
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
so why am I asking you to support this
 
01:03:05.809 --> 01:03:05.819 align:start position:0%
one well let's get into it
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis should have never been
 
01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
criminalized in the first place as a
 
01:03:11.809 --> 01:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
matter of fact criminalization began
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
with attacks
 
01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
the marijuana Tax Act of 1937. here we
 
01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:17.809 align:start position:0%
the marijuana Tax Act of 1937. here we
are

01:03:17.809 --> 01:03:17.819 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
this was in fact the very beginning of
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
the war on drugs or should I say the war
 
01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
on people is no matter who the stated
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
enemy it's time for us to recognize that
 
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
this war has been an abject failure
 
01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:32.819 align:start position:0%
many of our neighbors have been lost to
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
this war my children and I are
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
collateral damage in this war their
 
01:03:38.569 --> 01:03:38.579 align:start position:0%
father died of a heroin overdose when he
 
01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:40.619 align:start position:0%
had the threat of a 15-year mandatory
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
minimum hanging over his head
 
01:03:44.809 --> 01:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
we feel that loss every day
 
01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
many in New Hampshire feel that loss as
 
01:03:47.099 --> 01:03:47.930 align:start position:0%
many in New Hampshire feel that loss as
well

01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:03:51.289 --> 01:03:51.299 align:start position:0%
our approach to this issue needs to
 
01:03:51.299 --> 01:03:52.609 align:start position:0%
our approach to this issue needs to
change

01:03:52.609 --> 01:03:52.619 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
while I wholeheartedly believe that this
 
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
change needs to be implemented
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
rationally strategically and carefully
 
01:04:02.569 --> 01:04:02.579 align:start position:0%
cannabis simply is not heroin it's not
 
01:04:05.089 --> 01:04:05.099 align:start position:0%
fentanyl cannabis simply does not carry
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
the same risk for harm
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
or overdose as these other substances
 
01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:13.140 align:start position:0%
and yet great harm is done when members
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
of our community are stopped searched
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
and detained left with criminal records
 
01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:22.140 align:start position:0%
or wait criminal records simply for
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
cultivating and consuming a plant
 
01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
cannabis can be grown safely and
 
01:04:30.049 --> 01:04:30.059 align:start position:0%
discreetly in our backyard gardens and
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
consumed in the comfort of our own homes
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
this bill provides for that
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
a few years ago I also lost my brother
 
01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
his drug of choice was alcohol
 
01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
and it and it ultimately took his life
 
01:04:45.890 --> 01:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
alcohol poisoned his body yet alcohol is
 
01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:47.210 align:start position:0%
alcohol poisoned his body yet alcohol is
legal

01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
legal
 
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
because we accept that some people will
 
01:04:52.609 --> 01:04:52.619 align:start position:0%
misuse certain substances but we allow
 
01:04:56.089 --> 01:04:56.099 align:start position:0%
individuals to moderate themselves
 
01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
I would argue
 
01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
that the Cannabis that cannabis carries
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
a much lower risk than alcohol a
 
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
substance which again is legal
 
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
but as we stand here and we vet and
 
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
debate these other cannabis bills the
 
01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
harm of criminalization continues
 
01:05:14.809 --> 01:05:14.819 align:start position:0%
that said I will vote in favor of any
 
01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
effort to legalize cannabis with a
 
01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
strong preference for those which do not
 
01:05:20.809 --> 01:05:20.819 align:start position:0%
impose a barrier between myself and my
 
01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
garden or place a tax on something I can
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
easily grow in it and with that I ask
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
you to pass press the red button thank
 
01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.430 align:start position:0%
you to pass press the red button thank
you

01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:05:35.809 --> 01:05:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:38.569 --> 01:05:38.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
I might support this bill
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
if it were not federally illegal it is
 
01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:48.299 align:start position:0%
currently illegal we can make it legal
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
here but it's not legal because the
 
01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:52.140 align:start position:0%
federal government still says it's
 
01:05:54.410 --> 01:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
illegal so if we are going to do
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
anything further than we've already done
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
with cannabis it has to be done very
 
01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
carefully very thoughtfully and in a way
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
that will not
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
draw attention to the fact that we are
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
flouting federal law
 
01:06:09.119 --> 01:06:10.609 align:start position:0%
flouting federal law
now

01:06:10.609 --> 01:06:10.619 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
if it were not federally legal I might
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
support it but it is
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
furthermore what we also don't do in
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
this house is pass bills that are going
 
01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:20.390 align:start position:0%
this house is pass bills that are going
nowhere

01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
nowhere
 
01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
and we know this bill's going nowhere
 
01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
why would we bother to pass it and send
 
01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
it on when we know its future already
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
we have several other bills we're
 
01:06:32.109 --> 01:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
working on that have a brighter future
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
so vote with me to support the committee
 
01:06:40.849 --> 01:06:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative Willie Walsh has
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
requested a roll call us that's
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:58.069 --> 01:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:03.370 --> 01:07:03.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
requested division vote this will be a
 
01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
division vote
 
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:49.130 align:start position:0%
 
here

01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:51.000 align:start position:0%

this is a division vote chair recognizes
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
representative Alexandria Murray for a
 
01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
know that cannabis is legalized in every
 
01:08:15.529 --> 01:08:15.539 align:start position:0%
state surrounding New Hampshire and if I
 
01:08:16.849 --> 01:08:16.859 align:start position:0%
know that our constituents have been
 
01:08:19.849 --> 01:08:19.859 align:start position:0%
begging us to legalize it here and if I
 
01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
know that there are other bills that
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
will have unpredictable outcomes in the
 
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
other body Mr Speaker would I now want
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
to double our chances at cannabis
 
01:08:30.169 --> 01:08:30.179 align:start position:0%
legalization by pressing the red button
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
jail recognizes representative mannion
 
01:08:41.570 --> 01:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that while some
 
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee are opposed to
 
01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
legislation due to health and traffic
 
01:08:51.769 --> 01:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
safety reasons a majority of the
 
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
committee members agree
 
01:08:55.610 --> 01:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
with the marijuana legalization in
 
01:08:57.650 --> 01:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
principle but felt that this bill was
 
01:08:59.209 --> 01:08:59.219 align:start position:0%
not the best legislation to accomplish
 
01:08:59.219 --> 01:09:00.169 align:start position:0%
not the best legislation to accomplish
that

01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:00.179 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:02.150 --> 01:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
and if I know that other legislation
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
before other committees is the best
 
01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
vehicle to accomplish this
 
01:09:08.329 --> 01:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Speaker if I know that
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
according to Mr Mckay school council at
 
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
South Park Elementary that drugs are bad
 
01:09:15.769 --> 01:09:15.779 align:start position:0%

01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
the eyes have it and the motion of ought
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:47.090 --> 01:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee on criminal
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
justice and Public Safety to which was
 
01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
referred House Bill 444fn enact
 
01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
prohibiting possession of a firearm at a
 
01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
polling place having considered the same
 
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
report the same with the Fallen
 
01:11:58.970 --> 01:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
resolution resolved that is inexpedient
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
to legislation of David mannion for the
 
01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee having
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
considered the same and being unable to
 
01:12:09.169 --> 01:12:09.179 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority Report with a
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill Otto pass
 
01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative Jody Newell for the
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:24.649 --> 01:12:24.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:27.169 --> 01:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I believe you'll get
 
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
two members from Durham today so this is
 
01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
our lucky day so the house the house
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
will be in order the member has a right
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
to be heard
 
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:38.090 align:start position:0%
to be heard
okay

01:12:38.090 --> 01:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
well I'm the I'm the prime sponsor
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
actually the only sponsor of HP 444 but
 
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
it has like wide support aside from
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
myself happily I'm not the first
 
01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
legislature to try to address the issue
 
01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
of firearms at the polling place but
 
01:12:52.610 --> 01:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
hopefully we pass this bill in the law I
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
can be the last so I've been attending
 
01:12:57.229 --> 01:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
elections for over 60 years now even
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
before I turned 18 my parents they were
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
the type of citizens who insisted on
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
voting in every election they were the
 
01:13:05.209 --> 01:13:05.219 align:start position:0%
type of parents who liked to bring their
 
01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:07.940 align:start position:0%
kids to the polling place with them so
 
01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
I've seen a lot of things of public
 
01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
places as a voter as a kid taking a lot
 
01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
my parents as a campaign worker and I've
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
really never seen a violent crime being
 
01:13:21.649 --> 01:13:21.659 align:start position:0%
committed at the polling place
 
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
um I've never seen seen lots of things
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
go wrong I've never seen anything happen
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
the election officials couldn't handle
 
01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
on their own without uh Without fire and
 
01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
they've already solved it without the uh
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
without any shots being fired obviously
 
01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:37.400 align:start position:0%
so your name cognitive the
 
01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:40.020 align:start position:0%
possibility of problems and I'm
 
01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
certainly glad that pulling places
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
always have a robust police presence
 
01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
aside from
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
well aside from deterring crime they're
 
01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
also part of the elections process
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
because they're the ones who are
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for uh delivering it's the
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
law enforcement Community delivers
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
election materials to the Secretary of
 
01:13:58.189 --> 01:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
State's office
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
and also there's
 
01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:02.219 align:start position:0%
we we have good turnout here at
 
01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
elections so there's always a need for
 
01:14:06.669 --> 01:14:06.679 align:start position:0%
uh directing traffic so
 
01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:08.580 align:start position:0%
I will
 
01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
you know I would admit it's pretty rare
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
to see anyone open carrying at the
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
polling place but I think uh I think
 
01:14:17.330 --> 01:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good thing you don't
 
01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
often see people open carrying at the
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
polling places I find that uh
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
well some people and I'm one of them and
 
01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
you can call us names call us
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
haplophobes but I find that to be
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
intimidating rather than reassuring
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
and in any case it's uh it's unnecessary
 
01:14:38.209 --> 01:14:38.219 align:start position:0%
because there's a robust police presence
 
01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
and this bill makes things as simple as
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
possible for gun owners and non-gun
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
owners alike
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
by simply banning guns and other deadly
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
weapons between 100 feet of the polling
 
01:14:49.970 --> 01:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
place using the commonly understood
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
meaning of the term polling place it's
 
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
um you know it's pretty easy to figure
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
out where the polling place was or quite
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
clearly marked so you're I don't think
 
01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:00.780 align:start position:0%
there's much you'd have to be pretty
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
oblivious to wander into polling place
 
01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
without knowing you're wandering into a
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
polling place with your gun or without
 
01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
your gun so
 
01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
um there are there's a specific carve
 
01:15:12.530 --> 01:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
out for weapons secured to the vehicles
 
01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
even those parked within 100 feet of the
 
01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
printing place
 
01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
there's also a car valve for law
 
01:15:20.689 --> 01:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers whether they're on
 
01:15:22.209 --> 01:15:22.219 align:start position:0%
duty or whether they're simply
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
exercising the right to vote
 
01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
and we also fairly Progressive absentee
 
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
voting laws so if you really really
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
can't stand to be without your gun for
 
01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
the few minutes it takes to cast a
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
ballot you can vote absentee so
 
01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
um I urge you to uh
 
01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote ought to pass on HB
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
444 thanks
 
01:15:55.610 --> 01:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
today in opposition of the itl motion
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
for HB 444
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
in case you are one of the very few
 
01:16:04.610 --> 01:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
people who didn't know New Hampshire is
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
an open carry state meaning gun owners
 
01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
can openly carry a loaded firearm
 
01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
without any license or permit
 
01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
in fact since 2017 the state has allowed
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
any gun owner to carry a concealed
 
01:16:17.810 --> 01:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
weapon without a license
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
armed intimidation is voter suppression
 
01:16:23.209 --> 01:16:23.219 align:start position:0%
plain and simple
 
01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
the this is uh this undemocratic form of
 
01:16:28.610 --> 01:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
harassment is unlawful and is an affront
 
01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
to our safety as well as the Integrity
 
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
of America's free and fair elections
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
some gun owners might be worried about
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
the possibility of encountering
 
01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.930 align:start position:0%
the possibility of encountering
criminals

01:16:38.930 --> 01:16:38.940 align:start position:0%
criminals
 
01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
abusers or other threats snow plow
 
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
drivers at the polling place and they
 
01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
should be able to take solace on the
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
fact that there will always be law
 
01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers on duty there
 
01:16:57.649 --> 01:16:57.659 align:start position:0%
HB 444 asked people not to carry their
 
01:16:59.630 --> 01:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
guns within a hundred feet of a polling
 
01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:00.830 align:start position:0%
guns within a hundred feet of a polling
place

01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
the same distance as those wishing to be
 
01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
out electioneering on voting days
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
including during a nor'easter
 
01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
HP 444 even has a specific carve out for
 
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
unloaded weapons secured in Motor
 
01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:14.940 align:start position:0%
Vehicles including those parked within
 
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
100 feet of a polling place
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
for those of you who do not believe that
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
guns and polling places are intimidating
 
01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
there are others who strongly disagree
 
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
couple of examples one town clerk said I
 
01:17:27.790 --> 01:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
am not a fan of guns and polling places
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
especially if they are in schools as a
 
01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
town employee and a mother who is a
 
01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
student in the building it makes me very
 
01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable I worry for the safety and
 
01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
well-being of our poll volunteers
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
residents colleagues and students in the
 
01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.250 align:start position:0%
residents colleagues and students in the
building

01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
one election volunteer reported that
 
01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:46.739 align:start position:0%
guns at polling places makes them feel
 
01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
very unsafe they say people should trust
 
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
election officials and the officers
 
01:17:52.729 --> 01:17:52.739 align:start position:0%
providing election security to do their
 
01:17:52.739 --> 01:17:53.990 align:start position:0%
providing election security to do their
jobs

01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
it would make this volunteer even more
 
01:17:57.770 --> 01:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
intimidated to have the person carrying
 
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
standing in the observer's area
 
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
one voter reported that it makes them
 
01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
extremely uneasy to see guns at the
 
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
polls and that it's completely
 
01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
unnecessary to carry a gun in a polling
 
01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
place they emphasized that especially in
 
01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
a place where people are gathering it
 
01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
increases the concern for someone being
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
hurt either intentionally or
 
01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.050 align:start position:0%
hurt either intentionally or
accidentally

01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
accidentally
 
01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
during our executive session one of our
 
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
committee members also spoke about how
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
guns at polling places left her feeling
 
01:18:28.189 --> 01:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
intimidated and unsafe when she voted
 
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
Court Justice Clarence Thomas agreed the
 
01:18:33.169 --> 01:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
right to vote freely and without
 
01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
intimidation supersedes the right to
 
01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:36.950 align:start position:0%
intimidation supersedes the right to
carry

01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
carry
 
01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislators should do the
 
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
right thing and veto the itl on HB 444
 
01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
in order to protect New Hampshire voters
 
01:18:47.209 --> 01:18:47.219 align:start position:0%
so another motion can be made and Mr
 
01:18:49.729 --> 01:18:49.739 align:start position:0%
Speaker I request a division vote this
 
01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
remember yielded questions
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
no member does not yield
 
01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker we have been carrying
 
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
firearms at polling places so for I
 
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
don't know a couple hundred years now
 
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
in if it's intimidating voters
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know how because we don't seem
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
to win all the elections
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm not really sure how they're
 
01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:23.530 align:start position:0%
so I'm not really sure how they're
intimidated

01:19:23.530 --> 01:19:23.540 align:start position:0%
intimidated
 
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
because they're certainly showing up
 
01:19:28.669 --> 01:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
we haven't had an issue we have never
 
01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
had an issue at a polls we just had a
 
01:19:34.090 --> 01:19:34.100 align:start position:0%
election in some towns with a blizzard
 
01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
and police weren't able to make it the
 
01:19:39.610 --> 01:19:39.620 align:start position:0%
people made it they voted
 
01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
no issues again
 
01:19:45.229 --> 01:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
if anyone in New Hampshire sees some
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
with a firearm in his surprise shocked
 
01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
or intimidated I don't know where
 
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
they've been because again we've been
 
01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
having guns for a couple hundred years
 
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
now it's not a shock it's in the New
 
01:19:58.250 --> 01:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution the United States
 
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution and in those constitutions
 
01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
it does not say you have to sacrifice
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
one right in order to exercise another
 
01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:10.140 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:21:58.850 --> 01:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that the presence
 
01:22:00.890 --> 01:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
of firearms at polling places can serve
 
01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
to intimidate voters and election
 
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
workers and if I know that a recent
 
01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
Brennan Center survey found that more
 
01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
than 50 percent of the election workers
 
01:22:12.169 --> 01:22:12.179 align:start position:0%

01:22:14.090 --> 01:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
personal safety
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
and if I know this country also has a
 
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
long and a very sad history of guns
 
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
being used by one group of people to
 
01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
keep other groups of people from boating
 
01:22:27.169 --> 01:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Speaker if I also know
 
01:22:29.290 --> 01:22:29.300 align:start position:0%
that as recently as June of last year
 
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
the U.S Supreme Court made it clear that
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
states are free to restrict the
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
possession of guns at polling places
 
01:22:38.930 --> 01:22:38.940 align:start position:0%

is illegal at a polling place
 
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%

01:30:11.930 --> 01:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
simply because they look different come

some have yet been enacted
 
01:30:37.010 --> 01:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
meanwhile the act of racial profiling
 
01:30:39.250 --> 01:30:39.260 align:start position:0%
itself has never been explicitly
 
01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
prohibited by New Hampshire law it is
 
01:30:46.610 --> 01:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
time to do so as over 30 other states
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:53.570 --> 01:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
our state has the unique distinction of
 
01:30:59.209 --> 01:30:59.219 align:start position:0%
having passed a motorcycle profiling law
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
but not a racial profiling law
 
01:31:05.689 --> 01:31:05.699 align:start position:0%
there is a problem here in New Hampshire
 
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
and we can address that issue because I
 
01:31:12.410 --> 01:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
believe that everyone in here in this
 
01:31:15.290 --> 01:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
room today realize what's happening in
 
01:31:17.149 --> 01:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire not talking about across
 
01:31:19.490 --> 01:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
the state talking about right here
 
01:31:21.169 --> 01:31:21.179 align:start position:0%
I know you have friends you might even
 
01:31:23.570 --> 01:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
have family members that experience the
 
01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
same situations
 
01:31:28.669 --> 01:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
and all we're asking is that we as a
 
01:31:31.370 --> 01:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
body stand and say
 
01:31:33.890 --> 01:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
it's not okay here in the state of New
 
01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:40.910 align:start position:0%
it's not okay here in the state of New
Hampshire

01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
before there was ever a name for racial
 
01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:45.770 align:start position:0%
before there was ever a name for racial
profiling

01:31:45.770 --> 01:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
profiling
 
01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
it has been ingrained in our country law
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement practices
 
01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
from a public safety perspective racial
 
01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:56.870 align:start position:0%
from a public safety perspective racial
profiling

01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
profiling
 
01:32:00.169 --> 01:32:00.179 align:start position:0%
results in a loss of trust and
 
01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
confidence in our law enforcement
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
it involves the unwarranted screening of
 
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
certain groups of people
 
01:32:13.689 --> 01:32:13.699 align:start position:0%
assumed by law enforcement agents to be
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
predisposed to criminal activity whereas
 
01:32:19.490 --> 01:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
we all know that is not true as well
 
01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:32:23.810 --> 01:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
I recognize your representative De
 
01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:35.810 align:start position:0%
I recognize your representative De
Lorenzo

01:32:35.810 --> 01:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.729 --> 01:32:40.739 align:start position:0%
I stand in support of HB 596 as amended
 
01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
as a black woman I believe that I was
 
01:32:46.610 --> 01:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
racially profiled by law enforcement in
 
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire town
 
01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
this was a couple of years ago it's one
 
01:32:52.970 --> 01:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
Saturday morning I was driving to the
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
Market Basket supermarket in surrattam
 
01:32:57.649 --> 01:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
on my way
 
01:33:00.110 --> 01:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
to the market I drove past the stratum
 
01:33:02.209 --> 01:33:02.219 align:start position:0%
police station
 
01:33:04.850 --> 01:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
and a few seconds later I glanced in my
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
rear view mirror and I noticed a town of
 
01:33:10.370 --> 01:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
Stratton police cruiser with flashing
 
01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
blue lights behind my car
 
01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:14.570 align:start position:0%
blue lights behind my car
well

01:33:14.570 --> 01:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
as I know it's the law to pull aside
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
pull to the side when you see flashing
 
01:33:22.490 --> 01:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
blue lights I pulled over and start my
 
01:33:24.649 --> 01:33:24.659 align:start position:0%
car and
 
01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
looked into my rear view mirror and I
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
realized that I was the one that was
 
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
being stopped
 
01:33:35.450 --> 01:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
so I was a little bit frightened and I
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
just so I just sat in my car I tried to
 
01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:42.060 align:start position:0%
remember to do what my parents and aunts
 
01:33:44.090 --> 01:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
and uncles told me to do when you're
 
01:33:47.689 --> 01:33:47.699 align:start position:0%
approached by the police and that is to
 
01:33:47.699 --> 01:33:49.430 align:start position:0%
approached by the police and that is to
um

01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
get your license and registration out
 
01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:53.990 align:start position:0%
get your license and registration out
um

01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
be polite don't talk back be respectable
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
to the officer
 
01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:02.030 align:start position:0%
to the officer
so

01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
the officer approached me I handed her
 
01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
my license in registration I didn't
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
bother to ask her why I was being
 
01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
stopped I think I was kind of in shock
 
01:34:14.450 --> 01:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:34:17.689 --> 01:34:17.699 align:start position:0%
as I sat there waiting for the report to
 
01:34:19.729 --> 01:34:19.739 align:start position:0%
come through I was thinking to myself
 
01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:23.340 align:start position:0%
you know why is this happening to me
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
there's nothing wrong with my car my car
 
01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
is in perfect condition
 
01:34:28.970 --> 01:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
um it's daytime so it wasn't like a
 
01:34:31.729 --> 01:34:31.739 align:start position:0%
headlight out or anything and
 
01:34:34.250 --> 01:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
um all of my my registration was valid
 
01:34:36.050 --> 01:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
my driver's license was valid my
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
insurance was valid and so I just sat
 
01:34:42.530 --> 01:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
there thinking about what my elders told
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:51.050 --> 01:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
tried to follow that
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
well a few minutes later the officer
 
01:34:58.250 --> 01:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
returned to my car and told me that I
 
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
she told me that she was looking for a
 
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.550 align:start position:0%
she told me that she was looking for a
red

01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
red
 
01:35:21.169 --> 01:35:21.179 align:start position:0%
Chrysler PT Cruiser vehicle
 
01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
my vehicle was a red Toyota Prius
 
01:35:28.610 --> 01:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
there's no way you could mistake a Prius
 
01:35:36.169 --> 01:35:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
as I am relating to this you can tell
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
but it still bothers me I still wonder
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
you know why did that happen why
 
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
would someone's thought me I'm a wife
 
01:35:52.430 --> 01:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
I'm a mother I'm a grandmother
 
01:35:53.570 --> 01:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
um you know it's just going to the store
 
01:35:57.290 --> 01:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
to get bread and milk on a Sunday
 
01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:58.250 align:start position:0%
to get bread and milk on a Sunday
morning

01:35:58.250 --> 01:35:58.260 align:start position:0%

01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:36:13.729 --> 01:36:13.739 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker we heard testimony in the
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
committee in an area concern that was
 
01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
raised was Title 18 U.S code section 242
 
01:36:22.129 --> 01:36:22.139 align:start position:0%
already making it a crime
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
for a person acting under color of law
 
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
to willfully deprive a person of a right
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
or privilege protected by the
 
01:36:32.209 --> 01:36:32.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
is there a possibility that political
 
01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
influence could lead to investigation
 
01:36:38.810 --> 01:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
subsequent prosecution

Mr Speaker if I know that racial

could rescind that
 
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:17.040 align:start position:0%

HB 170 simply requires instruction in

these Topics by the end of fifth grade
 
01:58:15.290 --> 01:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
the fact that students are not required

on basic math facts
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
I think it's no coincidence that test

01:58:45.950 --> 01:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
have declined as less and less
 
01:58:48.430 --> 01:58:48.440 align:start position:0%
importance is given to the basics
 
01:58:51.830 --> 01:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
memorizing the timetables may be tedious
 
01:58:53.629 --> 01:58:53.639 align:start position:0%
and hard work
 
01:58:56.149 --> 01:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
but it is also essential and comes with
 
01:58:57.709 --> 01:58:57.719 align:start position:0%
a great reward
 
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
the ability to solve more complicated
 
01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%

cursive handwriting like multiplication
 
01:59:12.050 --> 01:59:12.060 align:start position:0%
tables is another basic skill that all
 
01:59:14.270 --> 01:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
children should be taught
 
01:59:18.649 --> 01:59:18.659 align:start position:0%
21 states currently require instruction
 
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
in cursive that is a 50 percent increase
 
01:59:26.990 --> 01:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
since 2016 as evidence in favor of its
 
01:59:31.010 --> 01:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
benefits becomes more and more obvious
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
numerous research studies have all come
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
to the same conclusion
 
01:59:39.410 --> 01:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
instruction incursive handwriting is
 
01:59:43.310 --> 01:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
incredibly good for kids
 
01:59:45.290 --> 01:59:45.300 align:start position:0%
it helps them develop hand-eye
 
01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:46.390 align:start position:0%
it helps them develop hand-eye
coordination

01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
coordination
 
01:59:48.709 --> 01:59:48.719 align:start position:0%
strengthens their memory
 
01:59:50.689 --> 01:59:50.699 align:start position:0%
and even improves the content of their
 
01:59:53.870 --> 01:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
writing and it's especially beneficial
 
01:59:56.390 --> 01:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
for dyslexic students
 
01:59:59.149 --> 01:59:59.159 align:start position:0%
but you don't need to read academic
 
02:00:01.189 --> 02:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
Journal articles to know the positive
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
effects that teaching cursive can have
 
02:00:06.830 --> 02:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
on children recently I've spoken with a
 
02:00:08.990 --> 02:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
few Educators experienced in teaching
 
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
cursive in the primary grades all of
 
02:00:14.450 --> 02:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
them said the same thing
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
that kids felt empowered
 
02:00:20.450 --> 02:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
by learning cursive writing they felt
 
02:00:22.970 --> 02:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
like they had broken a code and that
 
02:00:25.850 --> 02:00:25.860 align:start position:0%
accomplishment brought them great pride
 
02:00:27.890 --> 02:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
even if some students don't go on to be
 
02:00:30.589 --> 02:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
lifelong cursive readers the ability to
 
02:00:32.810 --> 02:00:32.820 align:start position:0%
read cursive should be considered one of
 
02:00:33.950 --> 02:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
the skills
 
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
that any literate person should have
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
because a lot of people still do write
 
02:00:45.530 --> 02:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
in cursive including me including most
 
02:00:46.970 --> 02:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
of you

multiplication tables is encouraged
 
02:01:17.030 --> 02:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
all HB 170 seeks to do is to give these
 
02:01:19.189 --> 02:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
two fundamental skills that are being
 
02:01:21.950 --> 02:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
overlooked in many schools the attention
 
02:01:25.729 --> 02:01:25.739 align:start position:0%
they deserve because an education
 
02:01:30.169 --> 02:01:30.179 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker as a New Hampshire Public
 
02:02:57.950 --> 02:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
School educator who taught cursive
 
02:03:00.410 --> 02:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
writing multiplication tables and
 
02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
computer literacy to many hundreds of
 
02:03:04.850 --> 02:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
students during my 40-year teaching
 
02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
career if I believe that given today's
 
02:03:10.189 --> 02:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
increasing technological development
 
02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
there is much debate on the value of
 
02:03:14.330 --> 02:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
cursive writing instruction and the
 
02:03:16.609 --> 02:03:16.619 align:start position:0%
memorization of multiplication tables in
 
02:03:18.169 --> 02:03:18.179 align:start position:0%
today's curricular
 
02:03:21.470 --> 02:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
and if I know that current law already
 
02:03:23.570 --> 02:03:23.580 align:start position:0%
states that the school board of each
 
02:03:25.790 --> 02:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
school district is encouraged to provide
 
02:03:28.250 --> 02:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
instruction in cursive handwriting and
 
02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
memorization of multiplication tables
 
02:03:34.189 --> 02:03:34.199 align:start position:0%
and lastly Mr Speaker if I believe that
 
02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
curriculum decisions should be made by
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
individual school districts giving local
 
02:03:41.330 --> 02:03:41.340 align:start position:0%

their students education
 
02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:46.080 align:start position:0%

thank you very much Mr Speaker
 
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
if I know the importance of teaching
 
02:04:03.290 --> 02:04:03.300 align:start position:0%
cursive writing and student learning
 
02:04:06.050 --> 02:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
multiplication facts in public schools
 
02:04:08.510 --> 02:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
cannot be understated
 
02:04:11.629 --> 02:04:11.639 align:start position:0%
and I if I also know research identifies
 
02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
that cursive writing strengthens the
 
02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:15.589 align:start position:0%
that cursive writing strengthens the
brain

02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%

strength and spelling and composition
 
02:04:21.169 --> 02:04:21.179 align:start position:0%
better supports those with dyslexia
 
02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
and should be required learning by the
 
02:04:26.629 --> 02:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
end of the fifth grade in this state
 
02:04:29.030 --> 02:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
if I also know there is overwhelming
 
02:04:32.089 --> 02:04:32.099 align:start position:0%
evidence and general consensus that
 
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
knowing math facts by the end of the
 
02:04:36.470 --> 02:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
fifth grade is essential to progressing
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
successfully in this subject area as
 
02:04:42.950 --> 02:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts presently requires that
 
02:04:45.530 --> 02:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
math B multiplication facts and tables
 
02:04:48.530 --> 02:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
be memorized by fifth grade and their
 
02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
scores are higher than ours what I then
 
02:04:53.830 --> 02:04:53.840 align:start position:0%

majority committee on education to which
 
02:06:27.229 --> 02:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
was referred House Bill 394 local act

relative to the organization of
 
02:06:30.109 --> 02:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school boards having
 
02:06:31.790 --> 02:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
considered the same report the same with
 
02:06:33.890 --> 02:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
the following resolution resolved that
 
02:06:35.930 --> 02:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
it's in expedient to legislate it's in

considered the same be an unable to
 
02:06:43.550 --> 02:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority Report with a
 
02:06:45.530 --> 02:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
recommendation to build a lot of pass
 
02:06:47.629 --> 02:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
representative Katie panternell for the
 
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee
 
02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:59.629 --> 02:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Speaker those of
 
02:07:02.750 --> 02:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
us on the education committee realize
 
02:07:05.149 --> 02:07:05.159 align:start position:0%
there are issues when it comes to to
 
02:07:08.030 --> 02:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts and we are
 
02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
considering several initiatives on those
 
02:07:12.890 --> 02:07:12.900 align:start position:0%
you'll probably see those next week
 
02:07:15.410 --> 02:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
during uh during the house session but
 
02:07:18.649 --> 02:07:18.659 align:start position:0%
House Bill 394 just totally misses the
 
02:07:18.659 --> 02:07:19.490 align:start position:0%
House Bill 394 just totally misses the
mark

02:07:19.490 --> 02:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
mark
 
02:07:22.189 --> 02:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
many of us serve towns that are members
 
02:07:24.589 --> 02:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
of Cooperative school districts in fact
 
02:07:28.070 --> 02:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
co-ops serve about one half of the 160
 
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
000 students who attend public schools
 
02:07:32.089 --> 02:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
02:07:34.010 --> 02:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
this bill takes management of these
 
02:07:36.050 --> 02:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school boards out of the
 
02:07:37.790 --> 02:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
hands of the voters
 
02:07:40.250 --> 02:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
it requires board leadership and meeting
 
02:07:43.970 --> 02:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
locations to rotate every year to change
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
every year from town to town for every
 
02:07:49.970 --> 02:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
town in the co-op School District
 
02:07:52.729 --> 02:07:52.739 align:start position:0%
first of all this can already happen now
 
02:07:54.530 --> 02:07:54.540 align:start position:0%
if it was a good idea
 
02:07:57.470 --> 02:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
without any need for legislation
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
Cooperative boards could just do this
 
02:08:03.050 --> 02:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
but wow this sounds confusing
 
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
where's the next score board meeting
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
going to be held and who will be the
 
02:08:08.510 --> 02:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
chair of the board
 
02:08:10.490 --> 02:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
we're best to leave this management up
 
02:08:12.770 --> 02:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
to the locals let's support the majority
 
02:08:18.290 --> 02:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:20.689 --> 02:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested members
 
02:08:40.129 --> 02:08:40.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:40.139 --> 02:09:24.370 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:09:24.370 --> 02:09:24.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:28.550 --> 02:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
spell 394. this is a division vote
 
02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Ladd for
 
02:09:40.010 --> 02:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:42.050 --> 02:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
if I know this bill provides the
 
02:09:44.930 --> 02:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity for all districts within a
 
02:09:47.330 --> 02:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District to host and
 
02:09:49.430 --> 02:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
even chair The Cooperative School
 
02:09:51.709 --> 02:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
District School Board
 
02:09:54.890 --> 02:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
and if I also know this bill is designed
 
02:09:57.830 --> 02:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
to encourage more public input from
 
02:10:00.530 --> 02:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
small communities that often seek
 
02:10:03.050 --> 02:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
greater involvement in the governance of
 
02:10:05.209 --> 02:10:05.219 align:start position:0%
a Cooperative School District in their
 
02:10:05.219 --> 02:10:06.290 align:start position:0%
a Cooperative School District in their
affairs

02:10:06.290 --> 02:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
affairs
 
02:10:08.450 --> 02:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
where I then support this small step
 
02:10:10.990 --> 02:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
toward encouraging district-wide
 
02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
involvement by pressing the red button
 
02:10:17.209 --> 02:10:17.219 align:start position:0%
so an alternative motion can be brought
 
02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
forward thank you very much Mr Speaker
 
02:10:22.490 --> 02:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
do you recognize the representative luno
 
02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:28.430 --> 02:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Speaker
 
02:10:30.530 --> 02:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
if I know locals already have the
 
02:10:32.270 --> 02:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
ability to rotate the chair of the
 
02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District board
 
02:10:36.649 --> 02:10:36.659 align:start position:0%
and if I know moving the location of
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
board meetings each year
 
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
would be confusing to most of the public
 
02:10:42.169 --> 02:10:42.179 align:start position:0%
and not lead to Greater public
 
02:10:42.179 --> 02:10:44.030 align:start position:0%
and not lead to Greater public
involvement

02:10:44.030 --> 02:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
involvement
 
02:10:46.070 --> 02:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
and if I know that half of us represent
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
constituents in Cooperative school
 
02:10:50.450 --> 02:10:50.460 align:start position:0%
districts who wouldn't want a
 
02:10:52.609 --> 02:10:52.619 align:start position:0%
heavy-handed law that dictates who
 
02:10:54.589 --> 02:10:54.599 align:start position:0%
serves as board chair and where the
 
02:10:56.990 --> 02:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
meetings are to be held than what I
 
02:10:58.669 --> 02:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
press the green button and support the
 
02:11:01.850 --> 02:11:01.860 align:start position:0%

cat Clause to make keeping cats more

surgical amputation of the last joints
 
02:20:27.230 --> 02:20:27.240 align:start position:0%

Behavior
 
02:20:37.849 --> 02:20:37.859 align:start position:0%
except in rare instances declawing is
 
02:20:39.950 --> 02:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
non-therapeutic meaning it has no
 
02:20:43.130 --> 02:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
medical benefit the recovery is long and
 
02:20:46.010 --> 02:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
excruciatingly painful for cats it
 
02:20:47.750 --> 02:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
permanently changes how they walk
 
02:20:49.490 --> 02:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
because their feet don't hit the ground
 
02:20:49.500 --> 02:20:50.690 align:start position:0%
because their feet don't hit the ground
naturally

02:20:50.690 --> 02:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
naturally
 
02:20:52.849 --> 02:20:52.859 align:start position:0%
it also removes the cat's national
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
natural defense mechanisms even indoor
 
02:21:00.230 --> 02:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:02.690 --> 02:21:02.700 align:start position:0%
but similar to other bills that we all
 
02:21:04.429 --> 02:21:04.439 align:start position:0%
care about there are no actual
 
02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
statistics some say it doesn't happen
 
02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:08.330 align:start position:0%

here

02:21:08.330 --> 02:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:21:10.790 --> 02:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
without this legislation Veterinary
 
02:21:12.770 --> 02:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
clients seeking this procedure can
 
02:21:14.809 --> 02:21:14.819 align:start position:0%
simply keep looking for a veterinarian
 
02:21:17.210 --> 02:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
until they find one who will comply with
 
02:21:20.830 --> 02:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
their demands it's cruel and unnecessary
 
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
and exceedingly painful so I ask you to
 
02:21:26.389 --> 02:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
please pass the green button to pass
 
02:21:29.330 --> 02:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
this thank you

thank you Mr speaker
 
02:21:58.730 --> 02:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
good morning house colleagues
 
02:22:02.090 --> 02:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
I rise today to ask that you vote no to
 
02:22:05.630 --> 02:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
OTP this bill hb231 which would ban the
 
02:22:07.969 --> 02:22:07.979 align:start position:0%
declawing of cats in New Hampshire and
 
02:22:09.950 --> 02:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
codify criminal penalties for
 
02:22:12.830 --> 02:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
veterinarians who perform this procedure
 
02:22:16.370 --> 02:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
this bill should be itl because this
 
02:22:18.469 --> 02:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
procedure is rarely done in New
 
02:22:21.290 --> 02:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there is no real need or
 
02:22:24.650 --> 02:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
pressing need to ban this and no need to
 
02:22:26.809 --> 02:22:26.819 align:start position:0%
codify harsh penalties
 
02:22:30.230 --> 02:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
more importantly the vast majority of
 
02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
veterinarians already discourage cat
 
02:22:35.570 --> 02:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
Decline and instead work with cat owners
 
02:22:38.270 --> 02:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
to use behavior modification techniques
 
02:22:40.429 --> 02:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
to prevent the cat from scratching
 
02:22:43.849 --> 02:22:43.859 align:start position:0%
family members or destroying property
 
02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
when those techniques fail and the
 
02:22:49.130 --> 02:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
veterinarian determines that decline is
 
02:22:52.130 --> 02:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
the only remaining solution aside from
 
02:22:55.429 --> 02:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
rehoming or euthanasia that should
 
02:22:57.590 --> 02:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
remain a choice between the owner and
 
02:22:58.910 --> 02:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
the veterinarian
 
02:23:03.050 --> 02:23:03.060 align:start position:0%
I want to stress that declawing a cat is
 
02:23:06.290 --> 02:23:06.300 align:start position:0%
a very last resort option
 
02:23:08.030 --> 02:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
the American Veterinary Medical
 
02:23:11.090 --> 02:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
Association respects of veterinarian's
 
02:23:13.790 --> 02:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
right to use professional judgment when
 
02:23:15.590 --> 02:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
deciding how to best protect their
 
02:23:17.570 --> 02:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
individual patients Health and Welfare
 
02:23:19.849 --> 02:23:19.859 align:start position:0%
and we should too
 
02:23:22.790 --> 02:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
consider cases where a family member may
 
02:23:25.130 --> 02:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
have developed an illness or autoimmune
 
02:23:27.230 --> 02:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
disease which would put them at risk if
 
02:23:30.469 --> 02:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
their cat scratches them consider too an
 
02:23:33.290 --> 02:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
elderly person who has thin skin and is
 
02:23:35.570 --> 02:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
taking blood thinners rather than
 
02:23:38.510 --> 02:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
euthanize their beloved cat or rehoming
 
02:23:41.030 --> 02:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
it as a last resort the cat can be
 
02:23:43.849 --> 02:23:43.859 align:start position:0%
humanely and safely declawed and allowed
 
02:23:45.770 --> 02:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
to live out its life in a loving home
 
02:23:48.250 --> 02:23:48.260 align:start position:0%
it's not just a matter of convenience
 
02:23:50.570 --> 02:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's a matter of health and
 
02:23:53.330 --> 02:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
safety and if an owner has tried all
 
02:23:55.730 --> 02:23:55.740 align:start position:0%
methods available to cease chronic
 
02:23:58.130 --> 02:23:58.140 align:start position:0%
scratching and if declawing was made
 
02:24:01.250 --> 02:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
illegal their options would be to
 
02:24:03.830 --> 02:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
abandon the cat re-home it to an
 
02:24:06.650 --> 02:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
unsuspecting home or Surrender it to a
 
02:24:06.660 --> 02:24:07.490 align:start position:0%
unsuspecting home or Surrender it to a
shelter

02:24:07.490 --> 02:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
shelter
 
02:24:10.010 --> 02:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
cats like these do not suddenly stop
 
02:24:12.530 --> 02:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
scratching behavior in a new home and
 
02:24:15.530 --> 02:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
the new family would have the problem
 
02:24:17.690 --> 02:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
cats that are brought to a shelter will
 
02:24:20.450 --> 02:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
either live out its life there not a
 
02:24:23.150 --> 02:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
life that I'd wish on any animal or the
 
02:24:25.130 --> 02:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
shelter will euthanize the cat to make
 
02:24:28.370 --> 02:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
room for more adoptable cat however if
 
02:24:30.349 --> 02:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
the cat was able to be declawed he could
 
02:24:32.690 --> 02:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
stay in his original loving home to live
 
02:24:36.050 --> 02:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
out a great life and additionally if we
 
02:24:38.510 --> 02:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
ban this procedure in New Hampshire then
 
02:24:40.370 --> 02:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
cat owners who feel that they need to
 
02:24:42.650 --> 02:24:42.660 align:start position:0%
have their cat declawed will simply take
 
02:24:44.750 --> 02:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
it to an unfamiliar vet across state
 
02:24:48.110 --> 02:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
lines to have the procedure done anyway
 
02:24:51.230 --> 02:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
as for this being a cruel procedure it
 
02:24:53.270 --> 02:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
can be argued that spaying and neutering
 
02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
is also cruel
 
02:24:58.370 --> 02:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
any surgical procedure that can be any
 
02:25:00.410 --> 02:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
surgical procedure can be deemed cruel
 
02:25:02.090 --> 02:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
or painful
 
02:25:04.610 --> 02:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
only two states new New York and
 
02:25:07.070 --> 02:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
Maryland statutorily ban this procedure
 
02:25:08.510 --> 02:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
and they've also banned other
 
02:25:11.450 --> 02:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
veterinarian medical procedures Banning
 
02:25:13.730 --> 02:25:13.740 align:start position:0%
cat declawing in New Hampshire will set
 
02:25:15.110 --> 02:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
a precedent for Banning other
 
02:25:17.750 --> 02:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
veterinarian medical procedures which we
 
02:25:20.330 --> 02:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
have already seen in my committee
 
02:25:20.340 --> 02:25:22.250 align:start position:0%
have already seen in my committee
furthermore

02:25:22.250 --> 02:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
furthermore
 
02:25:24.349 --> 02:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
the criminal penalty in this bill is
 
02:25:26.750 --> 02:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
really unenforceable who could prove
 
02:25:28.610 --> 02:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
that a veterinarian did a declaw without
 
02:25:30.710 --> 02:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
a medical reason New Hampshire
 
02:25:32.630 --> 02:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
veterinarians should not have to worry
 
02:25:35.389 --> 02:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
about being accused of Performing this
 
02:25:37.610 --> 02:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
or any other procedure
 
02:25:40.670 --> 02:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
and for all of these reasons I ask you
 
02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
to please press the red button and vote
 
02:25:45.889 --> 02:25:45.899 align:start position:0%
this bill in expedient to legislate so
 
02:25:47.809 --> 02:25:47.819 align:start position:0%
the cat owners and their veterinarians
 
02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
can together continue to be able to make
 
02:25:53.150 --> 02:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
legitimate appropriate and informed
 
02:25:55.610 --> 02:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
choices in New Hampshire and Mr Speaker
 
02:25:59.570 --> 02:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
I request a division vote thank you
 
02:26:05.809 --> 02:26:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:07.849 --> 02:26:07.859 align:start position:0%
all right I'd like to apologize to the
 
02:26:09.590 --> 02:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
speaker and especially to our honorable
 
02:26:11.330 --> 02:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
chairwoman for jumping the gun there a
 
02:26:13.370 --> 02:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
few minutes ago I'd like to point out
 
02:26:16.490 --> 02:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
that first of all uh this is the penalty
 
02:26:18.830 --> 02:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh in this case is actually a civil
 
02:26:20.990 --> 02:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
penalty rather than a criminal penalty
 
02:26:22.809 --> 02:26:22.819 align:start position:0%
that's an important point to make
 
02:26:24.889 --> 02:26:24.899 align:start position:0%
addressing a couple of arguments that
 
02:26:27.170 --> 02:26:27.180 align:start position:0%
were made in Committee in opposition to
 
02:26:29.630 --> 02:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
this bill first of all regarding the
 
02:26:31.309 --> 02:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
fact that we don't know how often this
 
02:26:32.750 --> 02:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
procedure is carried out in the state
 
02:26:35.570 --> 02:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
that it's true but it is also true that
 
02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
we know that it is carried out in this
 
02:26:40.550 --> 02:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
state two of the three cats that my
 
02:26:42.349 --> 02:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
family has adopted from the Humane
 
02:26:45.110 --> 02:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
Society in recent years were declawed
 
02:26:47.990 --> 02:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
and they came from New Hampshire so we
 
02:26:49.790 --> 02:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
know that it does happen the fact the
 
02:26:52.250 --> 02:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
most reputable veterinarians will not
 
02:26:55.190 --> 02:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
report or admit that they did it first
 
02:26:57.349 --> 02:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
of all speaks to the cruelty of the
 
02:26:59.270 --> 02:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
procedure but also makes it impossible
 
02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
for us to have reliable statistics
 
02:27:04.849 --> 02:27:04.859 align:start position:0%
there's also the argument this
 
02:27:07.309 --> 02:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
intervenes in that relationship between
 
02:27:11.690 --> 02:27:11.700 align:start position:0%
the client and the veterinarian
 
02:27:14.450 --> 02:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
this law still makes it permissible to
 
02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
have medical or therapeutic decline that
 
02:27:19.790 --> 02:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
is a medical decision and that medical
 
02:27:22.730 --> 02:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
decision certainly should be between the
 
02:27:24.889 --> 02:27:24.899 align:start position:0%
client and the veterinarian in this law
 
02:27:28.130 --> 02:27:28.140 align:start position:0%
keeps that in place
 
02:27:30.710 --> 02:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
the Centers for Disease Control no
 
02:27:34.190 --> 02:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
longer recommends declawing of cats for
 
02:27:36.889 --> 02:27:36.899 align:start position:0%
people with immunodeficiency disorders
 
02:27:39.610 --> 02:27:39.620 align:start position:0%
and we heard from a couple of Physicians
 
02:27:44.270 --> 02:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
via letters to make that point
 
02:27:49.130 --> 02:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
finally I would point out that since the
 
02:27:51.170 --> 02:27:51.180 align:start position:0%
ability of the veterinarian to perform
 
02:27:53.809 --> 02:27:53.819 align:start position:0%
this procedure for medical purposes at
 
02:27:57.110 --> 02:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
their discretion remains in the bill all
 
02:27:59.809 --> 02:27:59.819 align:start position:0%
that is left is the decline of cats for
 
02:28:02.270 --> 02:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
the convenience of the owner and that is
 
02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
simply unacceptable so I ask my
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the house to vote
 
02:28:12.230 --> 02:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:14.690 --> 02:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested members
 
02:28:42.770 --> 02:28:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:09.469 --> 02:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:11.630 --> 02:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
the motion before us
 
02:29:14.750 --> 02:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass on House Bill 231 this
 
02:29:16.910 --> 02:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
is a division vote
 
02:29:18.650 --> 02:29:18.660 align:start position:0%

02:29:24.950 --> 02:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:27.889 --> 02:29:27.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that zero
 
02:29:29.870 --> 02:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
evidence has been presented to suggest
 
02:29:31.969 --> 02:29:31.979 align:start position:0%
that any New Hampshire veterinarian has
 
02:29:34.429 --> 02:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
acted maliciously toward a single cat
 
02:29:37.130 --> 02:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
and that this bill will criminalize our
 
02:29:39.650 --> 02:29:39.660 align:start position:0%
state's veterinarians likely leading to
 
02:29:41.570 --> 02:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
further prohibition of Veterinary
 
02:29:44.929 --> 02:29:44.939 align:start position:0%
procedures and Mr Speaker if I know that
 
02:29:46.670 --> 02:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
a vast majority of our state's
 
02:29:49.570 --> 02:29:49.580 align:start position:0%
veterinarians choose to not declaw cats
 
02:29:53.210 --> 02:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
voluntarily and those who do do so as a
 
02:29:55.910 --> 02:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
last resort against extreme feline
 
02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
behavioral scratching instead of
 
02:30:01.969 --> 02:30:01.979 align:start position:0%
euthanasia and furthermore Mr Speaker if
 
02:30:04.010 --> 02:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
I know that outlawing and banning
 
02:30:06.469 --> 02:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
practices actually creates underground
 
02:30:08.990 --> 02:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
markets for them would I please hit the
 
02:30:11.929 --> 02:30:11.939 align:start position:0%
red button to ensure access to safe and
 
02:30:15.170 --> 02:30:15.180 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
02:30:25.969 --> 02:30:25.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
02:30:27.590 --> 02:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
know that no one who testified in our
 
02:30:29.090 --> 02:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
committee disagreed with the knowledge
 
02:30:32.450 --> 02:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
that Kat decoy causes Lifeline life long
 
02:30:34.070 --> 02:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
pain to cats with complications
 
02:30:36.230 --> 02:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
including arthritis neuropathic pain
 
02:30:38.870 --> 02:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
bone fragments left behind and changes
 
02:30:40.790 --> 02:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
in behavior and I know that this
 
02:30:42.710 --> 02:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
legislation would give veterinarians the
 
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
ability to point to state law and say no
 
02:30:46.790 --> 02:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
to a procedure that most no longer want
 
02:30:48.889 --> 02:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
to perform and if I further know that
 
02:30:50.570 --> 02:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
Studies have shown no increase in
 
02:30:52.370 --> 02:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
abandoned cats where the procedures
 
02:30:54.889 --> 02:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
outlawed would I then press green for

okay so if you have a snow day like
 
02:36:07.070 --> 02:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday two days ago where nobody was
 
02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
there and you were you had you stayed on
 
02:36:10.080 --> 02:36:11.510 align:start position:0%
there and you were you had you stayed on
site

02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
site
 
02:36:15.070 --> 02:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
even though the the tipped wage is 2.36
 
02:36:19.250 --> 02:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
2.36 an hour you must stay there in your
 
02:36:21.230 --> 02:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
St you must receive seven dollars 25
 
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
cents by your employer
 
02:36:25.429 --> 02:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
so just so you understand that fact
 
02:36:25.439 --> 02:36:27.290 align:start position:0%
so just so you understand that fact
now

02:36:27.290 --> 02:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:36:30.170 --> 02:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
I profess to know a lot of things in my
 
02:36:31.610 --> 02:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
tenure in the labor committee about
 
02:36:34.309 --> 02:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
Labor so things but I've never been a
 
02:36:36.410 --> 02:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
tipped employee in my life so I don't
 
02:36:39.170 --> 02:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
know what it's like so I started asking
 
02:36:40.490 --> 02:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
some questions
 
02:36:41.990 --> 02:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
and I've been fortunate enough to go out
 
02:36:44.809 --> 02:36:44.819 align:start position:0%
to a few dinners in the last month or so
 
02:36:47.450 --> 02:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
and it's amazing when you asked
 
02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
someone about the system and the tip
 
02:36:51.889 --> 02:36:51.899 align:start position:0%
wages what they say
 
02:36:53.929 --> 02:36:53.939 align:start position:0%
it's it's funny because one of the
 
02:36:56.950 --> 02:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
comments made in one of the blurbs here
 
02:37:00.050 --> 02:37:00.060 align:start position:0%
is that while this may not generally be
 
02:37:02.150 --> 02:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
a problem for a server who works at a
 
02:37:04.070 --> 02:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
higher end establishment those who work
 
02:37:05.690 --> 02:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
in bargain price restaurants struggle
 
02:37:08.929 --> 02:37:08.939 align:start position:0%
under the current wage system
 
02:37:11.090 --> 02:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
so I was at a diner
 
02:37:13.070 --> 02:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
and I asked I told him who I was and why
 
02:37:14.990 --> 02:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
I was asking
 
02:37:16.910 --> 02:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
and they said well you don't understand
 
02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:18.770 align:start position:0%
and they said well you don't understand
well

02:37:18.770 --> 02:37:18.780 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:37:20.929 --> 02:37:20.939 align:start position:0%
because people who eat breakfast in the
 
02:37:20.939 --> 02:37:22.309 align:start position:0%
because people who eat breakfast in the
morning

02:37:22.309 --> 02:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:37:24.770 --> 02:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
they eat quick and they go I get more
 
02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
tables I get more people that are come
 
02:37:28.969 --> 02:37:28.979 align:start position:0%
and go they get in they get out and they
 
02:37:31.429 --> 02:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
actually leave a better tip
 
02:37:33.830 --> 02:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
because you know two people come in have
 
02:37:35.450 --> 02:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
a quick breakfast it's
 
02:37:37.849 --> 02:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
it's uh 15 16 they'll just leave a
 
02:37:39.710 --> 02:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
twenty dollar bill
 
02:37:42.530 --> 02:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
that actually this this waitress did
 
02:37:44.450 --> 02:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
feel she did better
 
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
at one of those if you has described a
 
02:37:48.710 --> 02:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
lower end
 
02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
restaurant and then you know what she
 
02:37:53.630 --> 02:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
told me she kind of set me back
 
02:37:55.070 --> 02:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
he said I don't know what you people do
 
02:37:56.510 --> 02:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
up there but will you stop fussing with
 
02:38:00.290 --> 02:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:02.090 --> 02:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
02:38:02.100 --> 02:38:03.050 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
um

02:38:03.050 --> 02:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:03.060 --> 02:38:04.429 align:start position:0%
um
because

02:38:04.429 --> 02:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
every job is different
 
02:38:08.570 --> 02:38:08.580 align:start position:0%
this individual works on Fridays and
 
02:38:10.130 --> 02:38:10.140 align:start position:0%
Saturdays and Sunday mornings that's all
 
02:38:12.170 --> 02:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
they want to work
 
02:38:13.910 --> 02:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
they get some extra income for those
 
02:38:15.349 --> 02:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
periods they work five or six hours
 
02:38:17.450 --> 02:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
really hard and they like it and that's
 
02:38:18.830 --> 02:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
what they do
 
02:38:20.450 --> 02:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
versus another gentleman is this
 
02:38:22.250 --> 02:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
full-time job at a nicer franchise
 
02:38:22.260 --> 02:38:23.389 align:start position:0%
full-time job at a nicer franchise
restaurant

02:38:23.389 --> 02:38:23.399 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
02:38:25.849 --> 02:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
and he gets fewer tables but higher tips
 
02:38:27.170 --> 02:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
because people are drinking on Fridays
 
02:38:29.389 --> 02:38:29.399 align:start position:0%
and Saturday nights so I learned this
 
02:38:30.950 --> 02:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
whole thing about the different aspects
 
02:38:32.090 --> 02:38:32.100 align:start position:0%
of different restaurants and different
 
02:38:34.190 --> 02:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
tipping what I learned is two of the
 
02:38:36.410 --> 02:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
three do not get paid the two dollars
 
02:38:38.270 --> 02:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
and 36 Cents kind of difficult when you
 
02:38:39.650 --> 02:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
start asking people personal questions
 
02:38:41.990 --> 02:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
but they were very nice to me about it
 
02:38:43.790 --> 02:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
one of them got paid five dollars an
 
02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
hour the other one got the 725 an hour
 
02:38:47.389 --> 02:38:47.399 align:start position:0%
plus the tips that is the decision that
 
02:38:49.910 --> 02:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
those owners made
 
02:38:51.530 --> 02:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
to get people to come into their
 
02:38:53.630 --> 02:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
restaurant to work
 
02:38:57.650 --> 02:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
because right now they have the option
 
02:38:58.969 --> 02:38:58.979 align:start position:0%
they can go where they want because
 
02:39:00.889 --> 02:39:00.899 align:start position:0%
everybody wants them
 
02:39:03.650 --> 02:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
so it's this this thing that I say all
 
02:39:04.969 --> 02:39:04.979 align:start position:0%
the time is some people get sick of
 
02:39:06.710 --> 02:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
hearing me say but sometimes the
 
02:39:08.750 --> 02:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
business owners know what they're doing
 
02:39:10.250 --> 02:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
and they know what it's going to take to
 
02:39:11.690 --> 02:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
get employees they know what's going to
 
02:39:14.330 --> 02:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
like to keep employees
 
02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
and I will forever remember
 
02:39:19.670 --> 02:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
someone saying to me will you stop
 
02:39:21.950 --> 02:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
messing with us we're fine so I would
 
02:39:24.070 --> 02:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
ask us to stop messing with us and vote
 
02:39:27.110 --> 02:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
against the ought to pass thank you very
 
02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:28.250 align:start position:0%
against the ought to pass thank you very
much

02:39:28.250 --> 02:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:39:34.370 --> 02:39:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:37.849 --> 02:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Aaron go bra
 
02:39:40.490 --> 02:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
speaker I did mean speaker
 
02:39:43.790 --> 02:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
Erin go bra Ireland forever
 
02:39:45.950 --> 02:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
02:39:49.969 --> 02:39:49.979 align:start position:0%
my first job with a W-2 was as a busboy
 
02:39:52.550 --> 02:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
official title at a cheat cheese on
 
02:39:55.090 --> 02:39:55.100 align:start position:0%
Dixie Highway in Louisville
 
02:39:58.490 --> 02:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
it was eye-opening restaurant work
 
02:40:01.610 --> 02:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
tipped wage jobs in general are easily
 
02:40:03.070 --> 02:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
among the most
 
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
arduous jobs you can take and this state
 
02:40:10.450 --> 02:40:10.460 align:start position:0%
being heavily
 
02:40:13.550 --> 02:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
heavily active as a state for tourism
 
02:40:17.210 --> 02:40:17.220 align:start position:0%
has a lot of jobs in this regard
 
02:40:19.849 --> 02:40:19.859 align:start position:0%
and the good news is New Hampshire was
 
02:40:21.410 --> 02:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
the first state to eliminate the
 
02:40:22.910 --> 02:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
sub-minimum wage for workers with
 
02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:24.290 align:start position:0%
sub-minimum wage for workers with
disabilities

02:40:24.290 --> 02:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
02:40:27.530 --> 02:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
so this bill would bring it into parity
 
02:40:30.950 --> 02:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
to have no workers with any note
 
02:40:33.469 --> 02:40:33.479 align:start position:0%
especially tipped wage workers with
 
02:40:35.570 --> 02:40:35.580 align:start position:0%
sub-minimum wage
 
02:40:39.610 --> 02:40:39.620 align:start position:0%
in our sub minimum wage is actually
 
02:40:42.650 --> 02:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
3.27 cents an hour here
 
02:40:45.349 --> 02:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
contrary to what we just heard
 
02:40:47.990 --> 02:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
and 11 other states have already
 
02:40:49.910 --> 02:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
eliminated the sub minimum wage for
 
02:40:53.110 --> 02:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
workers the the
 
02:40:56.510 --> 02:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
woke States like Alaska Minnesota
 
02:41:01.490 --> 02:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
Montana Nevada and I think Utah
 
02:41:04.429 --> 02:41:04.439 align:start position:0%
and so we can compare those 11 states to
 
02:41:07.130 --> 02:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
the rest of us and see how our
 
02:41:08.809 --> 02:41:08.819 align:start position:0%
restaurants doing and we have that
 
02:41:11.270 --> 02:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
information as a matter of fact on an
 
02:41:12.590 --> 02:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
investor call
 
02:41:15.590 --> 02:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
the owner or CEO of The Darden
 
02:41:18.530 --> 02:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
Restaurant said well in California we
 
02:41:20.389 --> 02:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
actually are doing much better we're
 
02:41:22.490 --> 02:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
able to open more locations and our
 
02:41:24.830 --> 02:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
workers are thriving and making more
 
02:41:28.370 --> 02:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:31.070 --> 02:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
and we know for sure that in one Fair
 
02:41:32.510 --> 02:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
wage States
 
02:41:35.090 --> 02:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
the tips in general are higher or the
 
02:41:38.870 --> 02:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
same as States than States who don't
 
02:41:41.230 --> 02:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
have one Fair wage so any
 
02:41:44.330 --> 02:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
any thoughts of that to the contrary are
 
02:41:46.010 --> 02:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
not true
 
02:41:49.090 --> 02:41:49.100 align:start position:0%
um actually full service restaurants
 
02:41:52.490 --> 02:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
in those 11 states there are more of
 
02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
them than before and
 
02:41:57.290 --> 02:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
um and here's the weirdest part about a
 
02:41:58.849 --> 02:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
sub-minimum wage
 
02:42:01.490 --> 02:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
doing research to find out why we even
 
02:42:02.750 --> 02:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
have it
 
02:42:06.050 --> 02:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
is very crazy we are literally the only
 
02:42:08.510 --> 02:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
country on Earth that has a sub minimum
 
02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:09.530 align:start position:0%
country on Earth that has a sub minimum
wage

02:42:09.530 --> 02:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
wage
 
02:42:13.910 --> 02:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
and it's because of what our society
 
02:42:17.410 --> 02:42:17.420 align:start position:0%
decided to do during emancipation
 
02:42:19.910 --> 02:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
I think this is very relevant to the
 
02:42:22.550 --> 02:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
debate to understand why we even have it
 
02:42:24.469 --> 02:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
because it's senseless
 
02:42:27.889 --> 02:42:27.899 align:start position:0%
and it's because when former slaves
 
02:42:32.150 --> 02:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
entered the job market as workers by and
 
02:42:34.090 --> 02:42:34.100 align:start position:0%
large the jobs that were in restaurants
 
02:42:39.410 --> 02:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
in rail cars other tip jobs they it was
 
02:42:42.170 --> 02:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
they did not receive any wage at all
 
02:42:44.450 --> 02:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
other than the tips that they were able
 
02:42:48.530 --> 02:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
to get at the behest of their customers
 
02:42:53.870 --> 02:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
so so what more awful way to enter
 
02:42:56.690 --> 02:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
emancipation than to be at the whim of
 
02:42:58.150 --> 02:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
the customer
 
02:43:00.710 --> 02:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
with all the great feelings in many
 
02:43:02.450 --> 02:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
states in the South I'm sure that wasn't
 
02:43:04.130 --> 02:43:04.140 align:start position:0%
very helpful at all
 
02:43:07.250 --> 02:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
and so since emancipation in all that
 
02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
time we've gone from zero wages to three
 
02:43:13.730 --> 02:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
dollars and 27 cents an hour
 
02:43:17.389 --> 02:43:17.399 align:start position:0%
and yes we are supposed to pay at least
 
02:43:20.210 --> 02:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
a minimum wage the regular minimum wage
 
02:43:23.210 --> 02:43:23.220 align:start position:0%
again confusing
 
02:43:26.270 --> 02:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
um to all tipped wage workers
 
02:43:29.210 --> 02:43:29.220 align:start position:0%
but this leaves our workers
 
02:43:31.790 --> 02:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation
 
02:43:35.690 --> 02:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
to be that much at the whims of
 
02:43:37.910 --> 02:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
um customers but more importantly there
 
02:43:39.530 --> 02:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
have been multiple restaurants in New
 
02:43:42.530 --> 02:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who have been found probably
 
02:43:45.410 --> 02:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
not out of any necessarily Melissa's
 
02:43:48.530 --> 02:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
malicious intent because the system's so
 
02:43:51.530 --> 02:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
confusing multiple restaurants in recent
 
02:43:53.570 --> 02:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
years have been
 
02:43:53.580 --> 02:43:54.230 align:start position:0%
years have been
um

02:43:54.230 --> 02:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:56.290 --> 02:43:56.300 align:start position:0%
found liable
 
02:44:00.349 --> 02:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
for wage theft and had to pay hundreds
 
02:44:02.710 --> 02:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
of thousands of dollars in fines
 
02:44:05.650 --> 02:44:05.660 align:start position:0%
including back wages to those workers
 
02:44:09.230 --> 02:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
because so many folks
 
02:44:12.469 --> 02:44:12.479 align:start position:0%
you know because it's so confusing don't
 
02:44:12.479 --> 02:44:13.429 align:start position:0%
you know because it's so confusing don't
um

02:44:13.429 --> 02:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:16.070 --> 02:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
understand the right way to to pay their
 
02:44:18.230 --> 02:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
workers while they're earning tips and
 
02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:19.389 align:start position:0%
workers while they're earning tips and
having

02:44:19.389 --> 02:44:19.399 align:start position:0%
having
 
02:44:23.690 --> 02:44:23.700 align:start position:0%
327 versus 7 25 an hour it's very
 
02:44:23.700 --> 02:44:26.150 align:start position:0%
327 versus 7 25 an hour it's very
confusing

02:44:26.150 --> 02:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:27.590 align:start position:0%
confusing
so

02:44:27.590 --> 02:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:44:29.690 --> 02:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
I could say many other things I'm going
 
02:44:31.429 --> 02:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
to skip most of my other points and just
 
02:44:36.710 --> 02:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
say a one Fair wage for our workers a
 
02:44:39.770 --> 02:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
majority of whom are women
 
02:44:42.230 --> 02:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
we have the highest amount of women who
 
02:44:45.950 --> 02:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
earn one Fair which would be benefiting
 
02:44:48.050 --> 02:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
from one Fair wage in New Hampshire the
 
02:44:50.570 --> 02:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
highest per capita tipped wage workers
 
02:44:52.010 --> 02:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
are female
 
02:44:56.750 --> 02:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
so in passing a one Fair wage system it
 
02:44:58.730 --> 02:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
would not just be less burdensome for
 
02:44:58.740 --> 02:45:00.170 align:start position:0%
would not just be less burdensome for
employers

02:45:00.170 --> 02:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
employers
 
02:45:02.150 --> 02:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
it would be the right thing to do for
 
02:45:04.730 --> 02:45:04.740 align:start position:0%
our workers and give that even playing
 
02:45:08.990 --> 02:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
field to the West boys and all the other
 
02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
tipped wage job workers that keep this
 
02:45:12.240 --> 02:45:13.570 align:start position:0%
tipped wage job workers that keep this
state

02:45:13.570 --> 02:45:13.580 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:45:16.429 --> 02:45:16.439 align:start position:0%
a Bastion of Tourism and many good
 
02:45:18.469 --> 02:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
things thank you
 
02:45:21.230 --> 02:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
so remember yield to questions
 
02:45:25.190 --> 02:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:27.110 --> 02:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
there's been a request for a roll call
 
02:45:29.210 --> 02:45:29.220 align:start position:0%

02:45:30.830 --> 02:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded this will be a
 
02:46:13.969 --> 02:46:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:20.389 --> 02:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:23.270 --> 02:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is
 
02:46:26.809 --> 02:46:26.819 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on House Bill 58.
 
02:46:29.450 --> 02:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a roll call vote the
 
02:46:30.830 --> 02:46:30.840 align:start position:0%

businesses in New Hampshire have the
 
02:46:51.170 --> 02:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
option to pay more for for the tipped

04:12:24.710 --> 04:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
know that the bill as it came was
 
04:12:27.889 --> 04:12:27.899 align:start position:0%
originally introduced had a flaw in it
 
04:12:30.110 --> 04:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
and if I know that that flaw was
 
04:12:32.990 --> 04:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
identified by the lawyer from the

Department of Labor
 
04:12:37.670 --> 04:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
and if my reading of this bill
 
04:12:39.590 --> 04:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
and the amendment
 
04:12:43.189 --> 04:12:43.199 align:start position:0%

04:15:52.729 --> 04:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:15:56.090 --> 04:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
in the years that our committee is poked
 
04:15:58.969 --> 04:15:58.979 align:start position:0%
and prodded at this section of law I
 
04:16:02.330 --> 04:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
have heard dozens of stories from
 
04:16:05.450 --> 04:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
members of this chamber current and
 
04:16:05.460 --> 04:16:06.650 align:start position:0%
members of this chamber current and
former

04:16:06.650 --> 04:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
former
 
04:16:10.729 --> 04:16:10.739 align:start position:0%
stories about the virtues of working
 
04:16:14.450 --> 04:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
your first job of a work experience
 
04:16:17.570 --> 04:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
during High School
 
04:16:19.510 --> 04:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
and I
 
04:16:22.429 --> 04:16:22.439 align:start position:0%
experiences that would have been
 
04:16:26.750 --> 04:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
curtailed if a bill such as this a bill
 
04:16:28.269 --> 04:16:28.279 align:start position:0%
that would
 
04:16:31.250 --> 04:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
restrict youth employment opportunities
 
04:16:34.010 --> 04:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
would have been in effect in law
 
04:16:36.710 --> 04:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
if I were to scale the experience of
 
04:16:39.590 --> 04:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
this chamber up to the whole state I can
 
04:16:41.929 --> 04:16:41.939 align:start position:0%
imagine that there are thousands of
 
04:16:45.349 --> 04:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
unique stories from around the state
 
04:16:47.090 --> 04:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
now some of these stories are probably
 
04:16:50.090 --> 04:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
more impactful from others if
 
04:16:52.729 --> 04:16:52.739 align:start position:0%
when you were 17 you had to knock off
 
04:16:54.710 --> 04:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
work a couple hours early would that
 
04:16:57.590 --> 04:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
really have changed your life maybe not
 
04:17:00.530 --> 04:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
but I'm remembering one story that a
 
04:17:03.290 --> 04:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
former member of this chamber told me
 
04:17:07.010 --> 04:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
when he was 16 he was in a bad domestic
 
04:17:09.790 --> 04:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
situation and he worked he worked a lot
 
04:17:12.530 --> 04:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
he made some money he was able to buy
 
04:17:15.410 --> 04:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
himself a car and that Independence
 
04:17:19.429 --> 04:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
financial and otherwise allowed him to
 
04:17:22.010 --> 04:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
get himself out of an abusive home
 
04:17:22.020 --> 04:17:23.809 align:start position:0%
get himself out of an abusive home
situation

04:17:23.809 --> 04:17:23.819 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:17:25.969 --> 04:17:25.979 align:start position:0%
now that's certainly an exceptional case
 
04:17:27.710 --> 04:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying there are thousands of
 
04:17:30.110 --> 04:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
stories just like his but each family
 
04:17:34.670 --> 04:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
has their own unique situation
 
04:17:36.170 --> 04:17:36.180 align:start position:0%
in committee
 
04:17:38.689 --> 04:17:38.699 align:start position:0%
I heard it said a couple of times that
 
04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
we can't make laws for the exception
 
04:17:43.130 --> 04:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
that we need to make laws for the
 
04:17:43.140 --> 04:17:44.269 align:start position:0%
that we need to make laws for the
majority

04:17:44.269 --> 04:17:44.279 align:start position:0%
majority
 
04:17:47.210 --> 04:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
well I would challenge us where we can
 
04:17:53.030 --> 04:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:55.550 --> 04:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
just because a situation Falls outside
 
04:17:59.030 --> 04:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
the norm doesn't mean we need to have
 
04:18:03.469 --> 04:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:05.809 --> 04:18:05.819 align:start position:0%
where families have their own special
 
04:18:09.790 --> 04:18:09.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances let's let the parents not
 
04:18:12.889 --> 04:18:12.899 align:start position:0%
legislatures do the parenting they can
 
04:18:15.650 --> 04:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
work with the employers with the schools
 
04:18:18.650 --> 04:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
with the kids themselves and make work
 
04:18:18.660 --> 04:18:20.570 align:start position:0%
with the kids themselves and make work
work

04:18:20.570 --> 04:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:18:23.210 --> 04:18:23.220 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if you would please join me
 
04:18:26.090 --> 04:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
in pressing the red button let's not
 
04:18:28.849 --> 04:18:28.859 align:start position:0%
legislate kids bedtimes
 
04:18:31.189 --> 04:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
let's defeat this motion so that a
 
04:18:34.130 --> 04:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
better motion can be made thank you do
 
04:18:40.189 --> 04:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:44.689 --> 04:18:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:44.699 --> 04:18:46.969 align:start position:0%
 
ever

04:18:46.969 --> 04:18:46.979 align:start position:0%
ever
 
04:18:48.410 --> 04:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
it's been habit we've heard it from a
 
04:18:49.729 --> 04:18:49.739 align:start position:0%
number of people today who said the same
 
04:18:49.739 --> 04:18:50.809 align:start position:0%
number of people today who said the same
thing

04:18:50.809 --> 04:18:50.819 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:18:52.370 --> 04:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
I want everybody to think about Market
 
04:18:52.380 --> 04:18:54.349 align:start position:0%
I want everybody to think about Market
Basket

04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
Basket
 
04:18:58.490 --> 04:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:00.530 --> 04:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
a lot of teenagers get their first job
 
04:19:02.750 --> 04:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
there it's a great place to work
 
04:19:04.910 --> 04:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
they offer scholarships to students who
 
04:19:07.309 --> 04:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
want to go on to college
 
04:19:09.170 --> 04:19:09.180 align:start position:0%
they are very accepting of anybody who
 
04:19:10.849 --> 04:19:10.859 align:start position:0%
wants to work there
 
04:19:13.370 --> 04:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
but they close at nine o'clock
 
04:19:16.309 --> 04:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
the bill before you would would mandate
 
04:19:19.130 --> 04:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
that the student working would have to
 
04:19:21.830 --> 04:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
leave exactly as they closed the store
 
04:19:23.630 --> 04:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
having had three children who have all
 
04:19:25.130 --> 04:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
worked at Market Basket two of which
 
04:19:27.170 --> 04:19:27.180 align:start position:0%
currently work at Market Basket but
 
04:19:30.889 --> 04:19:30.899 align:start position:0%
they're older than this age crap group
 
04:19:33.530 --> 04:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
they don't get to leave at nine o'clock
 
04:19:36.110 --> 04:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
when they close down the cafe or they
 
04:19:38.150 --> 04:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
close down the grocery section
 
04:19:39.769 --> 04:19:39.779 align:start position:0%
or they're still pushing carts in
 
04:19:43.010 --> 04:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
they're there till 9 15.
 
04:19:45.769 --> 04:19:45.779 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do with this bill is
 
04:19:47.809 --> 04:19:47.819 align:start position:0%
tell Market baskets and any other
 
04:19:50.210 --> 04:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
employer that has a facility that closes
 
04:19:52.670 --> 04:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
at 9 pm you need to bring somebody else
 
04:19:55.429 --> 04:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
in do that last 15 minutes worth of work
 
04:19:57.889 --> 04:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that the goal of the of
 
04:20:00.170 --> 04:20:00.180 align:start position:0%
this bill is to make sure children have
 
04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
a reasonable bedtime
 
04:20:03.830 --> 04:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure we could ever legislate
 
04:20:05.870 --> 04:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
that and we definitely shouldn't be
 
04:20:08.389 --> 04:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
telling employers how to re how to close
 
04:20:10.010 --> 04:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
their business if they want to close at
 
04:20:14.450 --> 04:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
9 pm please vote itl or please vote red
 
04:20:15.950 --> 04:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
on autopath so we can bring up a
 
04:20:17.809 --> 04:20:17.819 align:start position:0%
separate motion do you recognize
 
04:20:27.590 --> 04:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:30.650 --> 04:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
well I Want To Praise Market Basket
 
04:20:32.689 --> 04:20:32.699 align:start position:0%
because the Department of Labor tells me
 
04:20:34.610 --> 04:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
that they are one of the best at
 
04:20:36.769 --> 04:20:36.779 align:start position:0%
adhering to the regulations
 
04:20:38.870 --> 04:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
they don't have problems with them they
 
04:20:40.729 --> 04:20:40.739 align:start position:0%
they do employ many teams my daughter
 
04:20:42.170 --> 04:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
was one
 
04:20:44.090 --> 04:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
they they do a wonderful job because
 
04:20:45.710 --> 04:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
they pay attention they don't have the
 
04:20:47.929 --> 04:20:47.939 align:start position:0%
violations because they pay attention to
 
04:20:47.939 --> 04:20:49.670 align:start position:0%
violations because they pay attention to
it

04:20:49.670 --> 04:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:20:49.680 --> 04:20:50.450 align:start position:0%
it
um

04:20:50.450 --> 04:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:50.460 --> 04:20:51.650 align:start position:0%
um
further

04:20:51.650 --> 04:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:20:54.290 --> 04:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
the department also tells me that if
 
04:20:56.030 --> 04:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
there's if there's so many punches out
 
04:20:58.010 --> 04:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
15 minutes later that's not what they're
 
04:20:59.630 --> 04:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
looking at they're looking at the abuse
 
04:21:01.370 --> 04:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
they're looking at The Chronic situation
 
04:21:04.729 --> 04:21:04.739 align:start position:0%
where someone is working a lot more
 
04:21:06.410 --> 04:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
hours than they should be and I've seen
 
04:21:09.110 --> 04:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
the violation reports and this is
 
04:21:12.290 --> 04:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
something that does happen I'll also
 
04:21:14.510 --> 04:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
note that the Department of Labor's
 
04:21:17.510 --> 04:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
inspections are complaint driven they're
 
04:21:19.250 --> 04:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
not look driving around looking for a
 
04:21:21.469 --> 04:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
place to inspect
 
04:21:26.330 --> 04:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
so back to my prepared remarks if I may
 
04:21:28.729 --> 04:21:28.739 align:start position:0%
the the current law
 
04:21:30.530 --> 04:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
has language
 
04:21:32.689 --> 04:21:32.699 align:start position:0%
that says in any employer's
 
04:21:34.849 --> 04:21:34.859 align:start position:0%
predetermined designated work week
 
04:21:36.769 --> 04:21:36.779 align:start position:0%
during which school is in session for
 
04:21:38.990 --> 04:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
five days
 
04:21:39.000 --> 04:21:40.790 align:start position:0%
five days
the

04:21:40.790 --> 04:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:21:44.330 --> 04:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
those who are 16 or 17 may not work more
 
04:21:46.969 --> 04:21:46.979 align:start position:0%
than 35 hours
 
04:21:50.570 --> 04:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
during that work week or okay so 35
 
04:21:52.790 --> 04:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
hours is a lot it used to be 30 we gave
 
04:21:54.530 --> 04:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
them 35 because we were trying to be
 
04:21:56.450 --> 04:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
reasonable and business friendly on the
 
04:21:58.429 --> 04:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
labor committee no problem
 
04:22:01.550 --> 04:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
but that language about during the work
 
04:22:03.889 --> 04:22:03.899 align:start position:0%
during the employer's predetermined Work
 
04:22:06.590 --> 04:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
Week remains and if you look further
 
04:22:08.689 --> 04:22:08.699 align:start position:0%
into legislation that allows an employer
 
04:22:12.290 --> 04:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
to have a kid work 48 hours if there's
 
04:22:14.809 --> 04:22:14.819 align:start position:0%
only four days of school that week I
 
04:22:16.670 --> 04:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
don't think we want that
 
04:22:19.790 --> 04:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
so another area that I that I tried to
 
04:22:22.130 --> 04:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
correct in this in this bill is that our
 
04:22:24.309 --> 04:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
law now says that
 
04:22:28.429 --> 04:22:28.439 align:start position:0%
school people are in school
 
04:22:30.769 --> 04:22:30.779 align:start position:0%
the law kicks in after Labor Day and we
 
04:22:33.349 --> 04:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
know that we know that school starts the
 
04:22:35.450 --> 04:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
last week of August so that's been a
 
04:22:37.969 --> 04:22:37.979 align:start position:0%
disadvantage for our tourist industry
 
04:22:39.950 --> 04:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
because the kids can't work as many
 
04:22:41.450 --> 04:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
hours you know
 
04:22:43.849 --> 04:22:43.859 align:start position:0%
until after you know that time
 
04:22:46.010 --> 04:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
so that's an improvement for the for the
 
04:22:46.020 --> 04:22:46.910 align:start position:0%
so that's an improvement for the for the
industry

04:22:46.910 --> 04:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
industry
 
04:22:49.250 --> 04:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
and so what I've done here is I
 
04:22:52.370 --> 04:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
clarified when school starts between the
 
04:22:54.229 --> 04:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
date on which the school year begins and
 
04:22:56.990 --> 04:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
the date school year ends because we
 
04:22:58.550 --> 04:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
know some schools use a different date
 
04:23:00.889 --> 04:23:00.899 align:start position:0%
that's local control
 
04:23:04.250 --> 04:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:23:07.010 --> 04:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
other and of course they can work more
 
04:23:09.050 --> 04:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
hours plenty of hours during the school
 
04:23:12.769 --> 04:23:12.779 align:start position:0%
vacation weeks of which there are three
 
04:23:14.929 --> 04:23:14.939 align:start position:0%
there's the there's one the February one
 
04:23:16.790 --> 04:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
that we just shared with those students
 
04:23:18.650 --> 04:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
then there's a December and there's an
 
04:23:20.809 --> 04:23:20.819 align:start position:0%
April so there's three weeks plus summer
 
04:23:23.150 --> 04:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
vacation that lots of students can get
 
04:23:25.370 --> 04:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
lots of experience working without
 
04:23:26.750 --> 04:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
without problem probably without
 
04:23:28.309 --> 04:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
interfering with their academic work
 
04:23:30.349 --> 04:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
which is why they're in school
 
04:23:32.330 --> 04:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
so when you have somebody who's you know
 
04:23:34.490 --> 04:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
a sophomore junior in high school
 
04:23:36.349 --> 04:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
they're there to learn and they're there
 
04:23:38.630 --> 04:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
to be to be at their best on their game
 
04:23:41.389 --> 04:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
so to speak they shouldn't be tired from
 
04:23:45.050 --> 04:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
working until 11 who knows 12 1 o'clock
 
04:23:47.150 --> 04:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
in the morning driving home with that
 
04:23:49.130 --> 04:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
they should be in bed they should have
 
04:23:50.750 --> 04:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
got their homework done they should be
 
04:23:52.910 --> 04:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
ready for the next day because that next
 
04:23:52.920 --> 04:23:53.809 align:start position:0%
ready for the next day because that next
day

04:23:53.809 --> 04:23:53.819 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:23:55.910 --> 04:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
determines the rest of their life
 
04:23:58.189 --> 04:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
it's not whether they had that car that
 
04:24:00.349 --> 04:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
they wanted or the fancy outfit for the
 
04:24:03.110 --> 04:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
prom those are nice memories
 
04:24:06.229 --> 04:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
but what you do in school affects the
 
04:24:10.370 --> 04:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:10.380 --> 04:24:11.929 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:24:11.929 --> 04:24:11.939 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:24:14.330 --> 04:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
let me let me briefly say that the the
 
04:24:16.670 --> 04:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
the minor issue that we tried to correct
 
04:24:19.849 --> 04:24:19.859 align:start position:0%
was referring to midnight instead of 12
 
04:24:22.250 --> 04:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
a.m I think the people on the other side
 
04:24:24.170 --> 04:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
of the wall can fix that if they listen
 
04:24:26.510 --> 04:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
to the labor department as I did but
 
04:24:28.189 --> 04:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
there is nothing wrong with working
 
04:24:30.590 --> 04:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
actually the bill says on the weekend
 
04:24:33.410 --> 04:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
being the Friday night and the Saturday
 
04:24:33.420 --> 04:24:34.849 align:start position:0%
being the Friday night and the Saturday
night

04:24:34.849 --> 04:24:34.859 align:start position:0%
night
 
04:24:36.650 --> 04:24:36.660 align:start position:0%
they can work till midnight now some
 
04:24:38.809 --> 04:24:38.819 align:start position:0%
people thought that was too much but I'm
 
04:24:40.250 --> 04:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
trying to be good to their businesses
 
04:24:42.889 --> 04:24:42.899 align:start position:0%
and to the kids who can do that
 
04:24:46.130 --> 04:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
so I'd ask you to press the green button
 
04:24:48.530 --> 04:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
and pass this bill
 
04:24:50.510 --> 04:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker the motion before
 
04:24:54.410 --> 04:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
us is on a pass on House Bill 125.
 
04:24:56.689 --> 04:24:56.699 align:start position:0%
it's in a center natasto has requested a
 
04:24:58.490 --> 04:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
roll side roll call and that is
 
04:25:00.110 --> 04:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
04:26:02.210 --> 04:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
know that the language that we're
 
04:26:04.370 --> 04:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
seeking to change with this bill has
 
04:26:06.250 --> 04:26:06.260 align:start position:0%
just gone into effect
 
04:26:09.469 --> 04:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
at the end of last term and if I also
 
04:26:11.870 --> 04:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
know that the committee heard no
 
04:26:15.110 --> 04:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
specific issues with the law as it was
 
04:26:16.670 --> 04:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
recently changed
 
04:26:19.610 --> 04:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
and if finally Mr Speaker I know that it
 
04:26:22.910 --> 04:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
is parents not legislatures that know
 
04:26:25.610 --> 04:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
how to make the best decisions for their
 
04:26:28.309 --> 04:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
16 and 17 year olds would I not press
 
04:26:30.590 --> 04:26:30.600 align:start position:0%

04:26:42.110 --> 04:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
that uh once upon a time I was 16 years
 
04:26:42.120 --> 04:26:43.429 align:start position:0%
that uh once upon a time I was 16 years
old

04:26:43.429 --> 04:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
old
 
04:26:46.189 --> 04:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
and I didn't make the greatest decisions
 
04:26:49.210 --> 04:26:49.220 align:start position:0%
some of them I regret today
 
04:26:51.530 --> 04:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
among them was not working quite as hard
 
04:26:53.809 --> 04:26:53.819 align:start position:0%
as school as I should have
 
04:26:56.929 --> 04:26:56.939 align:start position:0%
and if I know that Paris sometimes you
 
04:26:58.849 --> 04:26:58.859 align:start position:0%
know as a parent myself
 
04:27:01.670 --> 04:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes we don't we asked the kid
 
04:27:04.250 --> 04:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
how's school today fine and we don't
 
04:27:05.870 --> 04:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
know until the report card comes out
 
04:27:08.210 --> 04:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
which as we know comes out after the
 
04:27:10.309 --> 04:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
education was missed out the grades are
 
04:27:13.130 --> 04:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
there or follow the poor performance or
 
04:27:15.710 --> 04:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
the modest performance and if I know
 
04:27:17.149 --> 04:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
it's hard to tell a kid you can't go to
 
04:27:18.830 --> 04:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
work anymore when they really like to go
 
04:27:21.830 --> 04:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
to work would I not help the business
 
04:27:23.990 --> 04:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
Community with a more clear
 
04:27:26.809 --> 04:27:26.819 align:start position:0%
statement on youth labor helped to help
 
04:27:28.670 --> 04:27:28.680 align:start position:0%

04:27:31.309 --> 04:27:31.319 align:start position:0%

Doug Thomas
 
04:30:12.359 --> 04:30:16.550 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas
but

04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:22.010 --> 04:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:24.410 --> 04:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker I Rise
 
04:30:28.370 --> 04:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
this afternoon to oppose the amendment
 
04:30:31.130 --> 04:30:31.140 align:start position:0%
to house bill 208.
 
04:30:33.530 --> 04:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
now on the surface it appears to be a
 
04:30:35.870 --> 04:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
fairly innocuous Amendment it changes a
 
04:30:40.969 --> 04:30:40.979 align:start position:0%
few dates from 2024 to 2026 1-2027 and
 
04:30:43.490 --> 04:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
it adds a clause about funding for
 
04:30:47.870 --> 04:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:49.969 --> 04:30:49.979 align:start position:0%
but the amendment is essentially the
 
04:30:52.610 --> 04:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
bill itself with just those few changes
 
04:30:54.050 --> 04:30:54.060 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned
 
04:30:57.050 --> 04:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
and the bill itself is a fundamentally
 
04:30:57.060 --> 04:30:58.910 align:start position:0%
and the bill itself is a fundamentally
dangerous

04:30:58.910 --> 04:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
04:31:00.950 --> 04:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
proposition for the State of New
 
04:31:00.960 --> 04:31:03.050 align:start position:0%
proposition for the State of New
Hampshire

04:31:03.050 --> 04:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:31:06.729 --> 04:31:06.739 align:start position:0%
this bill could even though it looks
 
04:31:10.210 --> 04:31:10.220 align:start position:0%
innocuous this good bill could actually
 
04:31:14.330 --> 04:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
fundamentally change the way we live
 
04:31:16.130 --> 04:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
it could allow government to dictate
 
04:31:18.649 --> 04:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
what kind of car you drive
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
to dictate how you heat your home
 
04:31:24.050 --> 04:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
to dictate where you can work
 
04:31:26.929 --> 04:31:26.939 align:start position:0%
to dictate where you can go on vacation
 
04:31:30.710 --> 04:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
or whether you could go on vacation
 
04:31:34.370 --> 04:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
that's what a climate action plan
 
04:31:38.389 --> 04:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:41.870 --> 04:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
this legislation says the general court
 
04:31:43.849 --> 04:31:43.859 align:start position:0%
declares that it shall be the energy
 
04:31:46.070 --> 04:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
apology of this state
 
04:31:48.830 --> 04:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
to achieve the greenhouse gas emission
 
04:31:51.950 --> 04:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
goals identified in the climate action
 
04:31:51.960 --> 04:31:54.590 align:start position:0%
goals identified in the climate action
plan

04:31:54.590 --> 04:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:57.110 --> 04:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
those goals are pretty draconian
 
04:31:59.809 --> 04:31:59.819 align:start position:0%
and to achieve them would require
 
04:32:04.130 --> 04:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:06.410 --> 04:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
we better be careful how we proceed with
 
04:32:09.889 --> 04:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:13.070 --> 04:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
now I'll point out that the use of the
 
04:32:14.870 --> 04:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
word goals
 
04:32:19.309 --> 04:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually make this a mandate
 
04:32:22.370 --> 04:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
but it would be an encouragement to
 
04:32:25.070 --> 04:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
adopt policies that could significantly
 
04:32:29.269 --> 04:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:33.170 --> 04:32:33.180 align:start position:0%
I'd also point out that the 2009 climate
 
04:32:37.849 --> 04:32:37.859 align:start position:0%
action plan contained 67 recommended
 
04:32:37.859 --> 04:32:38.990 align:start position:0%
action plan contained 67 recommended
actions

04:32:38.990 --> 04:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
actions
 
04:32:41.990 --> 04:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
one of which was to import
 
04:32:44.929 --> 04:32:44.939 align:start position:0%
hydro and wind power from Canada
 
04:32:50.110 --> 04:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:53.330 --> 04:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
but the reality remains that putting a
 
04:32:55.370 --> 04:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
policy like this in place the
 
04:32:56.929 --> 04:32:56.939 align:start position:0%
representative will suspend for a minute
 
04:32:59.330 --> 04:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
is is are you speaking to the amendment
 
04:33:01.670 --> 04:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
or to the bill itself
 
04:33:04.369 --> 04:33:04.379 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker the amendment is the bill
 
04:33:10.910 --> 04:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:13.369 --> 04:33:13.379 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line here is simple
 
04:33:16.730 --> 04:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
this amendment and is the bill itself
 
04:33:19.070 --> 04:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
with a few small changes and it's a
 
04:33:21.830 --> 04:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
fundamentally dangerous bill I urge you
 
04:33:24.949 --> 04:33:24.959 align:start position:0%
to vote no on the amendment thank you Mr
 
04:33:26.390 --> 04:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
Speaker there's a member yield of
 
04:33:26.400 --> 04:33:27.529 align:start position:0%
Speaker there's a member yield of
questions

04:33:27.529 --> 04:33:27.539 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:33:27.539 --> 04:33:29.750 align:start position:0%
questions
yes

04:33:29.750 --> 04:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:33:31.970 --> 04:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
remember yields thank you Mr Speaker and
 
04:33:33.051 --> 04:33:33.061 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
04:33:34.970 --> 04:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
question I'm looking at a section of the
 
04:33:36.590 --> 04:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
amendment here and I'm trying to figure
 
04:33:39.470 --> 04:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
out what this has to do with climate
 
04:33:42.109 --> 04:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
action plans energy or the climate at
 
04:33:44.269 --> 04:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
all where it says this plan must
 
04:33:45.949 --> 04:33:45.959 align:start position:0%
consider opportunities to encourage
 
04:33:47.750 --> 04:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
public and private investment towards
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
rural low moderate low-income low to
 
04:33:52.730 --> 04:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
moderate income minority communities in
 
04:33:53.750 --> 04:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and provide for
 
04:33:55.609 --> 04:33:55.619 align:start position:0%
opportunities for small businesses
 
04:33:57.349 --> 04:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
schools affordable housing associations
 
04:33:59.510 --> 04:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
and other community institutes to
 
04:34:01.250 --> 04:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
participate and benefit from Statewide
 
04:34:03.289 --> 04:34:03.299 align:start position:0%
efforts this sounds like some type of a
 
04:34:05.631 --> 04:34:05.641 align:start position:0%
socialization plan and can you explain
 
04:34:10.970 --> 04:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:11.869 --> 04:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:34:14.810 --> 04:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
representative all this language is
 
04:34:17.449 --> 04:34:17.459 align:start position:0%
designed to give government the power to
 
04:34:19.670 --> 04:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
do virtually anything it wants in a
 
04:34:21.349 --> 04:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
climate action plan
 
04:34:23.510 --> 04:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the things that makes
 
04:34:25.970 --> 04:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
it dangerous thank you
 
04:34:36.289 --> 04:34:36.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:39.709 --> 04:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr speaker thank you for those
 
04:34:41.330 --> 04:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
interesting perspectives
 
04:34:43.670 --> 04:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh this amendment makes a few
 
04:34:45.890 --> 04:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
improvements and clarifications to the
 
04:34:48.769 --> 04:34:48.779 align:start position:0%
language of the original Bill 208 in
 
04:34:50.330 --> 04:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
response to the testimony that we heard
 
04:34:52.310 --> 04:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
in committee and concerns that were
 
04:34:55.369 --> 04:34:55.379 align:start position:0%
raised from my colleagues so mainly it
 
04:34:57.109 --> 04:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
adjusts the deadline dates for the
 
04:34:58.789 --> 04:34:58.799 align:start position:0%
reports and the first emissions
 
04:35:01.189 --> 04:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
reduction goal to move them two years
 
04:35:03.410 --> 04:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
into the future so which we heard was
 
04:35:05.029 --> 04:35:05.039 align:start position:0%
necessary to make them more reasonably
 
04:35:07.609 --> 04:35:07.619 align:start position:0%
achievable for Des
 
04:35:10.070 --> 04:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment also adds a section as was
 
04:35:12.890 --> 04:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
noted Section 5 that clarifies that any
 
04:35:15.349 --> 04:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
costs the Des incurs that are associated
 
04:35:17.750 --> 04:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
with Personnel or administrative support
 
04:35:19.970 --> 04:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
to prepare the plan and Emissions
 
04:35:21.830 --> 04:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
inventory should come from federal
 
04:35:23.990 --> 04:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
grants which have recently been made
 
04:35:25.849 --> 04:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
available specifically for this kind of
 
04:35:28.551 --> 04:35:28.561 align:start position:0%
work or in the unlikely event that the
 
04:35:30.830 --> 04:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
timeline for that isn't fast enough they
 
04:35:32.570 --> 04:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
can use some of the funds that the state
 
04:35:34.131 --> 04:35:34.141 align:start position:0%
receives from the regional greenhouse
 
04:35:36.890 --> 04:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
gas initiative as a backup source
 
04:35:39.590 --> 04:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
so please vote to adopt the amendment so
 
04:35:41.150 --> 04:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
that we can vote on the best possible
 
04:35:43.490 --> 04:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
version of this important bill and
 
04:35:45.109 --> 04:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
ensure that the state has a climate plan
 
04:35:47.570 --> 04:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
that will make us eligible to receive as
 
04:35:49.670 --> 04:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
many federal dollars for federal or for
 
04:35:51.949 --> 04:35:51.959 align:start position:0%
energy projects as is possible by
 
04:36:12.830 --> 04:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:12.840 --> 04:36:14.269 align:start position:0%

members
 
04:40:05.448 --> 04:40:05.458 align:start position:0%
in my committee we're told often just
 
04:40:08.150 --> 04:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
how far New Hampshire lags behind the
 
04:40:09.830 --> 04:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
other states around us
 
04:40:11.390 --> 04:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
that we should be more like the other
 
04:40:13.550 --> 04:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
states around us
 
04:40:16.130 --> 04:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
maybe that's why we're experiencing the
 
04:40:19.130 --> 04:40:19.140 align:start position:0%
greatest influx of people coming in from
 
04:40:21.050 --> 04:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
Most states in New Hampshire they like
 
04:40:23.930 --> 04:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we know how to we know how
 
04:40:26.270 --> 04:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
to take care of our environment we have
 
04:40:29.330 --> 04:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
clean air we have good mountain views we
 
04:40:31.610 --> 04:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
have great beaches
 
04:40:34.070 --> 04:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
this Committee Member the
 
04:40:36.470 --> 04:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
agencies that we have here Des
 
04:40:39.470 --> 04:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and
 
04:40:42.470 --> 04:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
Department of energy they know how to
 
04:40:45.230 --> 04:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
take care and guide us through the
 
04:40:47.990 --> 04:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
environmental crisis that everyone is
 
04:40:50.208 --> 04:40:50.218 align:start position:0%
looking at here and they've been doing a
 
04:40:51.288 --> 04:40:51.298 align:start position:0%
great job
 
04:40:54.350 --> 04:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
that's why we already have a climate
 
04:40:57.590 --> 04:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
action plan it was in 2009
 
04:41:00.010 --> 04:41:00.020 align:start position:0%
and we've done quite well with that
 
04:41:04.070 --> 04:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
just a few days ago I learned that there
 
04:41:05.990 --> 04:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
is federal money coming down that will
 
04:41:10.730 --> 04:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
enable the Des to write an update
 
04:41:13.190 --> 04:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
I asked the es do you need legislative
 
04:41:15.470 --> 04:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
direction to write an update to your
 
04:41:18.288 --> 04:41:18.298 align:start position:0%
climate action plan they said no
 
04:41:20.270 --> 04:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
and since we've done such a great job
 
04:41:23.990 --> 04:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
with the 2009 plan I have complete trust
 
04:41:25.610 --> 04:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
that our
 
04:41:28.250 --> 04:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
state employees will do a great job in
 
04:41:31.070 --> 04:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
updating according to federal guidelines
 
04:41:34.010 --> 04:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
what the next climate action plan will
 
04:41:36.230 --> 04:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
be and using the money that is being
 
04:41:39.110 --> 04:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
given to us by by the federal agency
 
04:41:41.330 --> 04:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
so we don't we don't really need this
 
04:41:43.970 --> 04:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
bill to write an update to a climate
 
04:41:45.230 --> 04:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
action plan
 
04:41:48.050 --> 04:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
what we need are good state employees
 
04:41:49.970 --> 04:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
that know the common sense that New
 
04:41:52.730 --> 04:41:52.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has to put in there what we
 
04:41:55.128 --> 04:41:55.138 align:start position:0%
already know is doing a good job in
 
04:41:57.590 --> 04:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
keeping our state so good that everyone
 
04:42:00.670 --> 04:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
is coming here for both hiking
 
04:42:04.010 --> 04:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
tourism and also to live
 
04:42:05.930 --> 04:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
now the other part of this bill talks
 
04:42:07.788 --> 04:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
about the New Hampshire energy
 
04:42:10.070 --> 04:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
Department of energy
 
04:42:12.770 --> 04:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass the department
 
04:42:16.430 --> 04:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
of energy would would be would be tasked
 
04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
with doing project planning
 
04:42:21.368 --> 04:42:21.378 align:start position:0%
funding determinations and Rule making
 
04:42:24.288 --> 04:42:24.298 align:start position:0%
this is not what the department of
 
04:42:29.150 --> 04:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
energy is for it is it is uh basically
 
04:42:31.730 --> 04:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
an economic regulator in our state and
 
04:42:34.190 --> 04:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
it's done a great job so far
 
04:42:38.030 --> 04:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
so if this bill were to pass that
 
04:42:40.788 --> 04:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
portion would have to be funded the
 
04:42:42.288 --> 04:42:42.298 align:start position:0%
department eventually would have to grow
 
04:42:44.990 --> 04:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
with staff members costing us more money
 
04:42:48.110 --> 04:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
on something that the department of uh
 
04:42:51.288 --> 04:42:51.298 align:start position:0%
Des is already doing
 
04:42:55.910 --> 04:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
so this bill isn't needed
 
04:42:59.150 --> 04:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
what we need is common sense and Trust
 
04:43:01.788 --> 04:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
in ours in our state employees to keep
 
04:43:04.250 --> 04:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
up with the uh with the environmental
 
04:43:06.350 --> 04:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
regulations that we already have to keep
 
04:43:08.090 --> 04:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire going
 
04:43:10.670 --> 04:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
we need that we also know that the the
 
04:43:12.948 --> 04:43:12.958 align:start position:0%
requirements that this bill would do are
 
04:43:12.958 --> 04:43:13.970 align:start position:0%
requirements that this bill would do are
extreme

04:43:13.970 --> 04:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
extreme
 
04:43:17.990 --> 04:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
such as having zero emissions by the
 
04:43:20.750 --> 04:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
year 2050 which we've seen reports
 
04:43:21.890 --> 04:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
saying that's just not going to happen
 
04:43:25.190 --> 04:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
plus affect our our economics in doing
 
04:43:27.650 --> 04:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
so we are New Hampshire we don't want to
 
04:43:29.810 --> 04:43:29.820 align:start position:0%
be like the rest of the states here
 
04:43:33.288 --> 04:43:33.298 align:start position:0%
that's why we don't need HP 208 and
 
04:43:34.550 --> 04:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's why we need to press the red
 
04:43:34.560 --> 04:43:37.310 align:start position:0%
that's why we need to press the red
button

04:43:37.310 --> 04:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:38.510 --> 04:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I recognize representative
 
04:43:38.520 --> 04:43:47.750 align:start position:0%
yeah I recognize representative
Christian

04:43:47.750 --> 04:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:50.030 --> 04:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:43:52.610 --> 04:43:52.620 align:start position:0%
this bill does too simple but critical
 
04:43:52.620 --> 04:43:53.868 align:start position:0%
this bill does too simple but critical
things

04:43:53.868 --> 04:43:53.878 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:43:56.930 --> 04:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
first it sets out a series of stepwise
 
04:43:58.490 --> 04:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
goals for reducing greenhouse gas
 
04:44:01.970 --> 04:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
emissions in the state in statute to 80
 
04:44:05.570 --> 04:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
of 1990 levels or less by 2050.
 
04:44:07.788 --> 04:44:07.798 align:start position:0%
then it charges the Department of
 
04:44:09.948 --> 04:44:09.958 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services with creating and
 
04:44:13.250 --> 04:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
maintaining plans to meet those goals
 
04:44:15.470 --> 04:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
a sponsor sponsored this bill first and
 
04:44:16.970 --> 04:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
foremost because the people of New
 
04:44:18.770 --> 04:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire want the state to have a
 
04:44:20.330 --> 04:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
climate plan
 
04:44:22.190 --> 04:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
with the exception of some date changes
 
04:44:23.810 --> 04:44:23.820 align:start position:0%
this bill is actually essentially
 
04:44:25.490 --> 04:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
identical to bills that were introduced
 
04:44:27.890 --> 04:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
in the last two sessions in 2020 it
 
04:44:30.288 --> 04:44:30.298 align:start position:0%
passed the house with a margin of 197 to
 
04:44:32.990 --> 04:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
123 but unfortunately died of covet
 
04:44:34.910 --> 04:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
death in the Senate last term it was
 
04:44:36.650 --> 04:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
tabled along with many other bills from
 
04:44:39.170 --> 04:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
this committee however the public
 
04:44:40.970 --> 04:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
support for all three iterations of this
 
04:44:43.368 --> 04:44:43.378 align:start position:0%
bill has been overwhelming with ten to
 
04:44:45.110 --> 04:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
one margins signing in for the bill
 
04:44:47.990 --> 04:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
versus against it we have a mandate from
 
04:44:51.590 --> 04:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
our constituents to act on climate
 
04:44:53.270 --> 04:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
a second reason that I sponsored this
 
04:44:55.550 --> 04:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
bill is because I believe that we as
 
04:44:57.288 --> 04:44:57.298 align:start position:0%
legislators have a responsibility to
 
04:44:58.910 --> 04:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
protect our residents and our state
 
04:45:01.190 --> 04:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
resources for future Generations
 
04:45:03.948 --> 04:45:03.958 align:start position:0%
climate change is real and it is already
 
04:45:05.868 --> 04:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
having negative impacts on our residents
 
04:45:08.150 --> 04:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
businesses and the environment
 
04:45:10.368 --> 04:45:10.378 align:start position:0%
warmer Winters are a killer for tourism
 
04:45:12.410 --> 04:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
and revenues in the North country
 
04:45:14.208 --> 04:45:14.218 align:start position:0%
hotter summers are bad for kids with
 
04:45:17.150 --> 04:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
asthma and older people with COPD
 
04:45:19.070 --> 04:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
warmer Waters and unpredictable weather
 
04:45:21.410 --> 04:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
patterns are major challenges for our
 
04:45:23.150 --> 04:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
fishermen farmers and maple sugar
 
04:45:23.160 --> 04:45:24.590 align:start position:0%
fishermen farmers and maple sugar
producers

04:45:24.590 --> 04:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
producers
 
04:45:26.330 --> 04:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
the science is clear that Global
 
04:45:28.190 --> 04:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
weirding is happening at an
 
04:45:30.110 --> 04:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
unprecedented rate due mostly to
 
04:45:32.150 --> 04:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions primarily from
 
04:45:34.610 --> 04:45:34.620 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels and that structural changes
 
04:45:36.830 --> 04:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
will be required to slow it down
 
04:45:39.530 --> 04:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
we have a responsibility to the Future
 
04:45:41.208 --> 04:45:41.218 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state and the world to
 
04:45:42.948 --> 04:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
do our part
 
04:45:45.590 --> 04:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
with that said I recognize that climate
 
04:45:47.150 --> 04:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
change alone may not be a persuasive
 
04:45:49.430 --> 04:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
argument for everyone in this chamber
 
04:45:52.010 --> 04:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about the money instead
 
04:45:53.868 --> 04:45:53.878 align:start position:0%
there's substantial evidence growing
 
04:45:55.730 --> 04:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
almost daily that Renewables and
 
04:45:57.530 --> 04:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
low-carbon Technologies in general are
 
04:46:00.470 --> 04:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
on learning curves or experience curves
 
04:46:01.850 --> 04:46:01.860 align:start position:0%
and what this means is that unlike
 
04:46:04.310 --> 04:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels which have cost essentially
 
04:46:06.650 --> 04:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
the same price per kilowatt produced for
 
04:46:06.660 --> 04:46:07.730 align:start position:0%
the same price per kilowatt produced for
centuries

04:46:07.730 --> 04:46:07.740 align:start position:0%
centuries
 
04:46:09.470 --> 04:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
renewable Technologies are becoming
 
04:46:12.530 --> 04:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
exponentially cheaper over time as
 
04:46:14.030 --> 04:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
production scales and this includes
 
04:46:15.530 --> 04:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
storage technology
 
04:46:17.090 --> 04:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
they're far exceeding initial
 
04:46:19.310 --> 04:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
expectations in terms of affordability
 
04:46:21.230 --> 04:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
so this is actually amazing news because
 
04:46:22.670 --> 04:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
it means that the sooner we make the
 
04:46:24.948 --> 04:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
switch from oil and gas to solar and
 
04:46:27.288 --> 04:46:27.298 align:start position:0%
wind and other new technologies the more
 
04:46:29.690 --> 04:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
money we can save
 
04:46:31.610 --> 04:46:31.620 align:start position:0%
excuse me I believe I have the right to
 
04:46:34.730 --> 04:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:36.410 --> 04:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
and this is not counting any costs of
 
04:46:38.810 --> 04:46:38.820 align:start position:0%
climate change itself at all nothing
 
04:46:41.330 --> 04:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
about the savings of preventing flooding
 
04:46:43.490 --> 04:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
or wildfires or drought so just the cost
 
04:46:45.110 --> 04:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
of the energy itself if you like
 
04:46:47.030 --> 04:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
citations there's a really fabulous
 
04:46:48.350 --> 04:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
paper published in the journal Jewel
 
04:46:50.030 --> 04:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
last year that I can recommend that
 
04:46:52.250 --> 04:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
shows these Trends clearly if you prefer
 
04:46:53.750 --> 04:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
anecdotes I can tell you there are
 
04:46:55.490 --> 04:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
already places many places in the
 
04:46:57.110 --> 04:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
country where wind and solar are
 
04:46:59.570 --> 04:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
regularly the least expensive sources of
 
04:47:02.208 --> 04:47:02.218 align:start position:0%
electricity and again this Gap is all
 
04:47:04.010 --> 04:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
but guaranteed to get wider over the
 
04:47:05.390 --> 04:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
next couple years I really can't
 
04:47:06.830 --> 04:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
emphasize this enough we literally
 
04:47:09.288 --> 04:47:09.298 align:start position:0%
cannot afford not to switch to
 
04:47:12.708 --> 04:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
Renewables as fast as we possibly can
 
04:47:14.628 --> 04:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
for me it's also important to consider
 
04:47:16.310 --> 04:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
that low carbon Tech presents an
 
04:47:18.350 --> 04:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to develop homegrown energy
 
04:47:20.690 --> 04:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
from in-state companies so we keep more
 
04:47:22.550 --> 04:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
energy dollars in the state
 
04:47:24.890 --> 04:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
and because renewable projects including
 
04:47:27.110 --> 04:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
energy storage projects can be cited
 
04:47:28.970 --> 04:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
throughout the state they ultimately
 
04:47:30.230 --> 04:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
help us build a more resilient
 
04:47:32.990 --> 04:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
distributed grid
 
04:47:34.910 --> 04:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
to be honest Granite Staters aren't
 
04:47:36.650 --> 04:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
actually all sitting around waiting for
 
04:47:38.810 --> 04:47:38.820 align:start position:0%
us on this we currently have many
 
04:47:41.030 --> 04:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
Municipal and individual level efforts
 
04:47:42.708 --> 04:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
in the state to produce renewable energy
 
04:47:46.070 --> 04:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
but what we don't have is a guiding
 
04:47:48.410 --> 04:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
binding plan at the state level to help
 
04:47:50.270 --> 04:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
businesses understand where best to make
 
04:47:52.368 --> 04:47:52.378 align:start position:0%
long-term Investments and to bridge the
 
04:47:54.288 --> 04:47:54.298 align:start position:0%
gap between local projects and the
 
04:47:56.690 --> 04:47:56.700 align:start position:0%
region level task of grid planning so
 
04:47:58.190 --> 04:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
they can be more efficient avoid
 
04:48:00.470 --> 04:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
planning missteps and delays and not get
 
04:48:02.030 --> 04:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
left out of opportunities as our
 
04:48:04.788 --> 04:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
neighboring states go forward
 
04:48:07.250 --> 04:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
on the topic of opportunities let's talk
 
04:48:10.190 --> 04:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
about the big one Federal investment
 
04:48:12.110 --> 04:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
money to accelerate the transition from
 
04:48:14.090 --> 04:48:14.100 align:start position:0%
fossil energy to Renewables is coming
 
04:48:15.948 --> 04:48:15.958 align:start position:0%
and it's clearly going to be a game
 
04:48:17.628 --> 04:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
changer for supporting Renewables
 
04:48:19.250 --> 04:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
projects Nationwide
 
04:48:22.430 --> 04:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not even eligible for
 
04:48:24.590 --> 04:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
some of these dollars because we don't
 
04:48:26.868 --> 04:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
have an appropriate state level climate
 
04:48:26.878 --> 04:48:28.010 align:start position:0%
have an appropriate state level climate
plan

04:48:28.010 --> 04:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
plan
 
04:48:30.170 --> 04:48:30.180 align:start position:0%
and where otherwise at an enormous
 
04:48:32.030 --> 04:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
competitive disadvantage among the other
 
04:48:33.350 --> 04:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
states that feed into the New England
 
04:48:35.570 --> 04:48:35.580 align:start position:0%
grid because yes Vermont Maine
 
04:48:37.190 --> 04:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Rhode Island Massachusetts
 
04:48:39.948 --> 04:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
all have ambitious and legally binding
 
04:48:42.288 --> 04:48:42.298 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas reduction goals they have
 
04:48:44.330 --> 04:48:44.340 align:start position:0%
plans and state administrative support
 
04:48:46.730 --> 04:48:46.740 align:start position:0%
in place to direct federal funds to
 
04:48:47.990 --> 04:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
benefit their people and their
 
04:48:51.050 --> 04:48:51.060 align:start position:0%
businesses and New Hampshire doesn't
 
04:48:53.090 --> 04:48:53.100 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to pay my fair share of
 
04:48:55.970 --> 04:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
federal taxes as part of my duties as a
 
04:48:58.430 --> 04:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
citizen of this great country but I also
 
04:49:00.050 --> 04:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that my community is
 
04:49:02.208 --> 04:49:02.218 align:start position:0%
going to receive our fair share of the
 
04:49:04.368 --> 04:49:04.378 align:start position:0%
return on federal Investments
 
04:49:06.708 --> 04:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
every other New England state has a real
 
04:49:08.570 --> 04:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
plan with shovel ready green energy
 
04:49:11.690 --> 04:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
projects they are aware all the dollars
 
04:49:13.128 --> 04:49:13.138 align:start position:0%
for modernizing New England's energy
 
04:49:15.590 --> 04:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
grid is going to go and they are where
 
04:49:17.448 --> 04:49:17.458 align:start position:0%
the jobs created with these projects are
 
04:49:19.490 --> 04:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
going to be so I don't know about you
 
04:49:21.230 --> 04:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
but when I'm out knocking doors next
 
04:49:22.970 --> 04:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
summer and fall I don't want my
 
04:49:24.650 --> 04:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
constituents asking me why New Hampshire
 
04:49:26.628 --> 04:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
is the only state in New England that
 
04:49:29.930 --> 04:49:29.940 align:start position:0%
isn't benefiting from a green jobs boom
 
04:49:33.288 --> 04:49:33.298 align:start position:0%
finally I do want to acknowledge yes my
 
04:49:35.150 --> 04:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
colleague from Londonderry is correct
 
04:49:37.490 --> 04:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does technically have a
 
04:49:39.708 --> 04:49:39.718 align:start position:0%
climate plan uh the first one was
 
04:49:41.810 --> 04:49:41.820 align:start position:0%
created 14 years ago and it had
 
04:49:43.670 --> 04:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
emissions reduction goals in lines with
 
04:49:46.190 --> 04:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
the ones proposed here and in line with
 
04:49:47.628 --> 04:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
what all the other states in New England
 
04:49:50.750 --> 04:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
have now but it was essentially ignored
 
04:49:53.090 --> 04:49:53.100 align:start position:0%
after the Lynch Administration ended so
 
04:49:55.190 --> 04:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
if these goals had been put into statute
 
04:49:56.628 --> 04:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
which is the difference with this bill
 
04:49:58.610 --> 04:49:58.620 align:start position:0%
if we had actually followed the
 
04:50:00.170 --> 04:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
recommendations set out in that plan
 
04:50:02.448 --> 04:50:02.458 align:start position:0%
instead of undermining them if we had
 
04:50:04.368 --> 04:50:04.378 align:start position:0%
stuck to the goal that was set then of
 
04:50:06.590 --> 04:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
obtaining 25 of our energy from
 
04:50:09.350 --> 04:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
Renewables by 2025. we would certainly
 
04:50:11.750 --> 04:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
be less reliant on gas today and there's
 
04:50:13.430 --> 04:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
every reason to believe that we would
 
04:50:14.690 --> 04:50:14.700 align:start position:0%
have been more resilient to those
 
04:50:16.430 --> 04:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
electricity price spikes that we saw
 
04:50:17.448 --> 04:50:17.458 align:start position:0%
this year
 
04:50:19.550 --> 04:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
and that final goal of an 80 reduction
 
04:50:23.270 --> 04:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
by 2050 would be that much closer
 
04:50:25.490 --> 04:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
so in Closing one thing that we've heard
 
04:50:27.410 --> 04:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
over and over again this year when the
 
04:50:30.110 --> 04:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
energy bills come up is that oh now just
 
04:50:31.910 --> 04:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
isn't the time to invest in Energy
 
04:50:34.788 --> 04:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
Efficiency Now isn't the time to invest
 
04:50:36.110 --> 04:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
in Renewables
 
04:50:38.810 --> 04:50:38.820 align:start position:0%
and you know what I actually I agree
 
04:50:41.090 --> 04:50:41.100 align:start position:0%
with that the right time was 20 years
 
04:50:45.110 --> 04:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
ago it was 14 years ago but we failed to
 
04:50:47.330 --> 04:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
act at that right time so the next best
 
04:50:50.930 --> 04:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
time to act the time that we have is now
 
04:50:54.170 --> 04:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
let us not let another 15 or 20 years go
 
04:50:55.788 --> 04:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
by let's not let our children and
 
04:50:57.650 --> 04:50:57.660 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and constituents look back
 
04:50:59.448 --> 04:50:59.458 align:start position:0%
at us and say the same thing that we're
 
04:51:01.250 --> 04:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
saying about previous legislatures that
 
04:51:02.810 --> 04:51:02.820 align:start position:0%
oh gosh this all could have been so much
 
04:51:05.628 --> 04:51:05.638 align:start position:0%
easier if they had just acted back then
 
04:51:07.310 --> 04:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
let's make energy transition a
 
04:51:09.590 --> 04:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
bipartisan issue stop kicking this can
 
04:51:12.230 --> 04:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
down the road and commit together to the
 
04:51:13.970 --> 04:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
serious energy transition plan that New
 
04:51:16.310 --> 04:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire deserves thank you
 
04:51:22.010 --> 04:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:24.948 --> 04:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
representative has requested a roll call
 
04:51:26.810 --> 04:51:26.820 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
04:52:11.390 --> 04:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:11.400 --> 04:52:19.550 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

04:52:19.550 --> 04:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:19.560 --> 04:52:27.350 align:start position:0%
 
clear

04:52:27.350 --> 04:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:29.628 --> 04:52:29.638 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is on a pass on
 
04:52:32.510 --> 04:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 208 this is a roll call vote
 
04:52:34.250 --> 04:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative votes
 
04:52:39.470 --> 04:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:42.170 --> 04:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
04:52:44.750 --> 04:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
if I know that 2009's New Hampshire
 
04:52:49.010 --> 04:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
climate action plan ran to 74 pages and
 
04:52:52.368 --> 04:52:52.378 align:start position:0%
recommended 67 steps the vast majority
 
04:52:53.890 --> 04:52:53.900 align:start position:0%
of which were never implemented
 
04:52:57.230 --> 04:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
including importation of Canadian hydro
 
04:53:00.230 --> 04:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:02.150 --> 04:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
if I also know that the Manhattan
 
04:53:04.610 --> 04:53:04.620 align:start position:0%
Institute has identified at least 42
 
04:53:07.730 --> 04:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
solid reasons that explain why Net Zero
 
04:53:10.368 --> 04:53:10.378 align:start position:0%
by any date can never happen
 
04:53:12.890 --> 04:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
which negates the need to plan for such
 
04:53:15.590 --> 04:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
a contingency
 
04:53:18.170 --> 04:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
and if I know that now is not the time
 
04:53:20.930 --> 04:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
to expand government influence over our
 
04:53:20.940 --> 04:53:23.090 align:start position:0%
to expand government influence over our
lives

04:53:23.090 --> 04:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
lives
 
04:53:25.788 --> 04:53:25.798 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that creating such
 
04:53:29.570 --> 04:53:29.580 align:start position:0%
plans is costly as well as ineffective
 
04:53:31.910 --> 04:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
what I now press the red button to
 
04:53:33.890 --> 04:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
relegate this bill to its rightful place
 
04:53:36.470 --> 04:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
in The Chronicles of historical futility
 
04:53:39.470 --> 04:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:53:41.868 --> 04:53:41.878 align:start position:0%
recognizes the Wendy Thomas
 
04:53:47.270 --> 04:53:47.280 align:start position:0%

04:53:55.430 --> 04:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
for join other New England states in
 
04:53:57.948 --> 04:53:57.958 align:start position:0%
setting medium and long-term greenhouse
 
04:54:00.708 --> 04:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
gas reduction plans and would require
 
04:54:02.570 --> 04:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
04:54:06.230 --> 04:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
to prepare and maintain five-year plans
 
04:54:09.350 --> 04:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
related to these targets and an annual
 
04:54:11.150 --> 04:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
emissions inventory
 
04:54:14.448 --> 04:54:14.458 align:start position:0%
and if I know climate change is
 
04:54:17.270 --> 04:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
occurring and already having an impact
 
04:54:20.030 --> 04:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire businesses environment
 
04:54:22.368 --> 04:54:22.378 align:start position:0%
and our state's health
 
04:54:24.830 --> 04:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
and if the lack of a specific climate
 
04:54:27.890 --> 04:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
plan to reduce greenhouse gas makes it
 
04:54:30.230 --> 04:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
more difficult for municipalities and
 
04:54:33.288 --> 04:54:33.298 align:start position:0%
businesses to make long-term investment
 
04:54:36.050 --> 04:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
decisions and that we must have a State
 
04:54:39.590 --> 04:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
climate plan in order to be eligible for
 
04:54:41.330 --> 04:54:41.340 align:start position:0%
certain federal funding that is
 
04:54:43.490 --> 04:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
dedicated to renewable energy project
 
04:54:45.170 --> 04:54:45.180 align:start position:0%

grid
 
04:54:49.368 --> 04:54:49.378 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that setting and
 
04:54:52.010 --> 04:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
pursuing ambitious greenhouse gas
 
04:54:54.708 --> 04:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
reduction goals is both the right thing
 
04:54:57.350 --> 04:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
to do from a climate an environmental
 
04:54:57.360 --> 04:54:58.490 align:start position:0%
to do from a climate an environmental

this state
 
04:55:07.010 --> 04:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
would I now do the right thing for New
 
04:55:09.368 --> 04:55:09.378 align:start position:0%

HB 263 brings us back to the land of Rex
 
05:04:01.610 --> 05:04:01.620 align:start position:0%
not train wrecks not Tyrannosaurus Rex
 
05:04:05.690 --> 05:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
but Renewable Energy Credit wrecks
 
05:04:07.850 --> 05:04:07.860 align:start position:0%
remember from a previous from our
 
05:04:11.030 --> 05:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
previous sessions utilities are required
 
05:04:13.730 --> 05:04:13.740 align:start position:0%
to provide a certain amount of Renewable
 
05:04:13.740 --> 05:04:14.750 align:start position:0%
to provide a certain amount of Renewable
Power

05:04:14.750 --> 05:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
Power
 
05:04:17.090 --> 05:04:17.100 align:start position:0%
and the law says they can do it one of
 
05:04:18.650 --> 05:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
three ways
 
05:04:22.070 --> 05:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
building newer renewable production
 
05:04:25.490 --> 05:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
but wait the vestment happened
 
05:04:25.500 --> 05:04:26.510 align:start position:0%
but wait the vestment happened
so

05:04:26.510 --> 05:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:04:29.390 --> 05:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
utilities can own power production that
 
05:04:31.128 --> 05:04:31.138 align:start position:0%
method is gone
 
05:04:33.470 --> 05:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
so they can do it by buying wrecks from
 
05:04:36.890 --> 05:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
suppliers who produce Renewable Power
 
05:04:39.350 --> 05:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
or if they can't find enough of those
 
05:04:42.350 --> 05:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
they can make alternative compliance
 
05:04:42.360 --> 05:04:44.750 align:start position:0%
they can make alternative compliance
payments

05:04:44.750 --> 05:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
payments
 
05:04:47.090 --> 05:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
now wrecks come from producers who fill
 
05:04:47.100 --> 05:04:48.050 align:start position:0%
now wrecks come from producers who fill
out

05:04:48.050 --> 05:04:48.060 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:04:50.690 --> 05:04:50.700 align:start position:0%
and get certificates these are generally
 
05:04:55.128 --> 05:04:55.138 align:start position:0%
large large suppliers of Renewable Power
 
05:04:57.170 --> 05:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
or they can be gathered up from the
 
05:04:59.750 --> 05:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
multiple small producers who don't fill
 
05:05:02.628 --> 05:05:02.638 align:start position:0%
out the certificate paperwork and this
 
05:05:05.990 --> 05:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
is called wreck sweeping
 
05:05:08.510 --> 05:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
it saves New Hampshire rate payers about
 
05:05:13.070 --> 05:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:16.990 --> 05:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
it's built into our statutes
 
05:05:19.128 --> 05:05:19.138 align:start position:0%
proponents of this bill
 
05:05:21.350 --> 05:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
have made the case that sweeping is
 
05:05:21.360 --> 05:05:23.448 align:start position:0%
have made the case that sweeping is
unconstitutional

05:05:23.448 --> 05:05:23.458 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
05:05:23.458 --> 05:05:26.208 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
unconstitutional

05:05:26.208 --> 05:05:26.218 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
05:05:28.970 --> 05:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
it is way too loud in here the member
 
05:05:30.890 --> 05:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
has a right to be heard if you need to
 
05:05:32.510 --> 05:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
have a conversation
 
05:05:35.690 --> 05:05:35.700 align:start position:0%
take it out to the annual
 
05:05:37.670 --> 05:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
remember we may continue
 
05:05:41.090 --> 05:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:42.590 --> 05:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
so they're saying this is an
 
05:05:45.230 --> 05:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional taking of an abandoned
 
05:05:48.470 --> 05:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
property without proper notice
 
05:05:51.050 --> 05:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
this is the same way that folks can
 
05:05:53.510 --> 05:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
gather up your abandoned soda cans for
 
05:05:56.868 --> 05:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
the nickel refund are constitutional
 
05:05:59.750 --> 05:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
scoff laws
 
05:06:02.030 --> 05:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
the bill requires the department of
 
05:06:05.208 --> 05:06:05.218 align:start position:0%
energy to make an annual notice to all
 
05:06:08.330 --> 05:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
small renewable energy suppliers
 
05:06:11.570 --> 05:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
that must fill out the paperwork or
 
05:06:14.510 --> 05:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
their utilities will sweep their Rex
 
05:06:14.520 --> 05:06:17.868 align:start position:0%
their utilities will sweep their Rex
values

05:06:17.868 --> 05:06:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:21.410 --> 05:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
that required mandate States among other
 
05:06:21.420 --> 05:06:23.170 align:start position:0%
that required mandate States among other
things

05:06:23.170 --> 05:06:23.180 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:06:26.930 --> 05:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
your energy May reduce overall renewable
 
05:06:29.150 --> 05:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
generation unless your system is
 
05:06:29.160 --> 05:06:30.770 align:start position:0%
generation unless your system is
certified

05:06:30.770 --> 05:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
certified
 
05:06:34.430 --> 05:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
well I can assure you as an owner of an
 
05:06:37.190 --> 05:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
uncertified solar tower
 
05:06:40.490 --> 05:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
I generate the same amount of power if
 
05:06:40.500 --> 05:06:41.930 align:start position:0%
I generate the same amount of power if
my

05:06:41.930 --> 05:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:06:47.150 --> 05:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
solar energy is certified or uncertified
 
05:06:50.570 --> 05:06:50.580 align:start position:0%
another statement that the doe is
 
05:06:52.970 --> 05:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
requiring to make
 
05:06:55.610 --> 05:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
the Federal Trade Commission may take
 
05:06:58.788 --> 05:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
action against you if you Market your
 
05:07:02.990 --> 05:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
home as running on renewable energy you
 
05:07:03.000 --> 05:07:04.310 align:start position:0%
home as running on renewable energy you
generate

05:07:04.310 --> 05:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
generate
 
05:07:08.090 --> 05:07:08.100 align:start position:0%
with the fine of ten thousand dollars a
 
05:07:08.100 --> 05:07:10.430 align:start position:0%
with the fine of ten thousand dollars a
day

05:07:10.430 --> 05:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:13.868 --> 05:07:13.878 align:start position:0%
now the Federal Trade Commission
 
05:07:17.708 --> 05:07:17.718 align:start position:0%
is to protect consumers and competition
 
05:07:21.650 --> 05:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
by preventing anti-competitive deceptive
 
05:07:25.610 --> 05:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
and unfair business practices
 
05:07:29.810 --> 05:07:29.820 align:start position:0%
selling your home is not a business
 
05:07:33.050 --> 05:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
whether you put a for sale sign on it
 
05:07:38.330 --> 05:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
with a picture of a solar panel or not
 
05:07:41.750 --> 05:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
on top of these claims the doe does not
 
05:07:44.930 --> 05:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
have the resources to make these notices
 
05:07:47.750 --> 05:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
or if it or if it asks the utilities to
 
05:07:48.590 --> 05:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
do it
 
05:07:51.410 --> 05:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
they will seek cost reimbursement from
 
05:07:52.910 --> 05:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
the rate payer
 
05:07:55.430 --> 05:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
the doe testified that they do not
 
05:07:57.770 --> 05:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
05:08:00.550 --> 05:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
so let's let utilities do their job
 
05:08:04.010 --> 05:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
sweep clean the wrecks and keep our
 
05:08:05.570 --> 05:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
rates down
 
05:08:07.730 --> 05:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
press the red button so that a better
 
05:08:09.948 --> 05:08:09.958 align:start position:0%

renewable energy certificate sweeping

businesses and residents Rec sweeping
 
05:08:38.570 --> 05:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
enables both private multi-billion

dollar out-of-state corporations and
 
05:08:43.850 --> 05:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
in-state utilities to use the renewable
 
05:08:45.708 --> 05:08:45.718 align:start position:0%
energy that was generated by New

statutory obligations
 
05:08:53.390 --> 05:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
effectively short-circuiting the state's

legal opinion obtained from multiple

members of the New Hampshire bar affirms
 
05:09:05.390 --> 05:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
this state seizure constitutes an
 
05:09:07.730 --> 05:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional taking of private
 
05:09:10.010 --> 05:09:10.020 align:start position:0%

05:09:15.288 --> 05:09:15.298 align:start position:0%
myself I am very concerned that without
 
05:09:17.930 --> 05:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
taking action this session the state is
 
05:09:20.270 --> 05:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
allowing an unconstitutional practice to
 
05:09:22.910 --> 05:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
stand effectively opening us up to a
 
05:09:25.670 --> 05:09:25.680 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:13:06.650 --> 05:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that a renewable
 
05:13:09.110 --> 05:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
energy certificate is like a grocery
 
05:13:10.730 --> 05:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
store coupon
 
05:13:15.470 --> 05:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
that must be redeemed to have any value
 
05:13:17.628 --> 05:13:17.638 align:start position:0%
if I also know that sometimes people
 
05:13:19.868 --> 05:13:19.878 align:start position:0%
don't need an incentive that a coupon
 
05:13:22.250 --> 05:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
provides even if they know it's
 
05:13:22.260 --> 05:13:24.590 align:start position:0%
provides even if they know it's
available

finally if I know that reminding folks
 
05:13:29.390 --> 05:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
via a letter of a coupon that they might
 
05:13:31.730 --> 05:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
not want will take money out of the
 
05:13:35.150 --> 05:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
pockets of every electricity customer
 
05:13:37.850 --> 05:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
when I press the red button to stop this
 
05:13:40.788 --> 05:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
nickeling and diming of red right pairs
 
05:13:42.650 --> 05:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:13:44.628 --> 05:13:44.638 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:13:53.868 --> 05:13:53.878 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that the practice
 
05:13:56.390 --> 05:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
of claiming renewable energy credits
 
05:13:58.610 --> 05:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
without notification by our utilities
 
05:14:01.448 --> 05:14:01.458 align:start position:0%
and private out-of-state corporations
 
05:14:05.150 --> 05:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
constitutes a taking of private property
 
05:14:07.310 --> 05:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
of dubious legality
 
05:14:09.110 --> 05:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
furthermore Mr Speaker if I know that
 
05:14:11.330 --> 05:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
this house recently voted to Outlaw the
 
05:14:11.340 --> 05:14:12.708 align:start position:0%
this house recently voted to Outlaw the
practice

05:14:12.708 --> 05:14:12.718 align:start position:0%
practice
 
05:14:14.868 --> 05:14:14.878 align:start position:0%

without notification
 
05:14:18.948 --> 05:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Speaker if I know that
 
05:14:21.288 --> 05:14:21.298 align:start position:0%
the fifteen thousand dollar cost of
 
05:14:23.510 --> 05:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
sending out notifications to eligible
 
05:14:27.650 --> 05:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
customer generators of renewable energy
 
05:14:29.930 --> 05:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
pales in comparison to the cost of
 
05:14:32.690 --> 05:14:32.700 align:start position:0%
defending this practice in court
 
05:14:36.708 --> 05:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:39.948 --> 05:14:39.958 align:start position:0%

take it out into the ante room

remember may continue thank you Mr
 
05:19:06.288 --> 05:19:06.298 align:start position:0%
Speaker in 1996 New Hampshire
 
05:19:08.150 --> 05:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
deregulated the electricity Market
 
05:19:10.610 --> 05:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
allowing utilities and even individual
 
05:19:12.470 --> 05:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
customers to purchase the bulk of their
 
05:19:14.570 --> 05:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
electricity on an open market
 
05:19:16.550 --> 05:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
but there is an exception for utilities
 
05:19:19.368 --> 05:19:19.378 align:start position:0%
they are forced to purchase any and all
 
05:19:21.350 --> 05:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
excess electricity generated by their
 
05:19:24.230 --> 05:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
customers at retail price rate they
 
05:19:26.090 --> 05:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
don't get a choice here they must buy
 
05:19:28.368 --> 05:19:28.378 align:start position:0%
this electricity even if there's a low
 
05:19:30.830 --> 05:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
demand at the time of generation
 
05:19:32.930 --> 05:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
by expanding net metering from one
 
05:19:35.570 --> 05:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
megawatt to five megawatts this will
 
05:19:37.550 --> 05:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
quintuple the amount of electricity
 
05:19:40.490 --> 05:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
utilities are forced to buy all costs
 
05:19:42.470 --> 05:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
related to this are passed down directly
 
05:19:45.708 --> 05:19:45.718 align:start position:0%
to rate payers that's you and me
 
05:19:47.930 --> 05:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
the other issue that comes up with net
 
05:19:50.330 --> 05:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
metering expansion is reliability
 
05:19:52.610 --> 05:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
when the utility buys electricity from
 
05:19:54.948 --> 05:19:54.958 align:start position:0%
the wholesale Market those purchases
 
05:19:56.930 --> 05:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
come with contractual obligation to
 
05:19:59.570 --> 05:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
produce power this means the utility can
 
05:20:01.490 --> 05:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
be sure that producers have an incentive
 
05:20:03.890 --> 05:20:03.900 align:start position:0%
to deliver reliable power over the
 
05:20:06.230 --> 05:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
length of the purchase agreement on the
 
05:20:08.090 --> 05:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
other hand when utilities purchase net
 
05:20:10.490 --> 05:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
metered electricity this comes with no
 
05:20:12.590 --> 05:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
contractual obligation
 
05:20:15.050 --> 05:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
when power is actually in demand a net
 
05:20:16.850 --> 05:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
meter customer can choose not to sell
 
05:20:19.128 --> 05:20:19.138 align:start position:0%
into the grid and conversely when
 
05:20:20.810 --> 05:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
there's load demand the customer can
 
05:20:23.110 --> 05:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
force the utility to buy
 
05:20:25.850 --> 05:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
utilities cannot depend on net metered
 
05:20:28.010 --> 05:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
electricity to reliably power the grid
 
05:20:30.948 --> 05:20:30.958 align:start position:0%
to avoid blackouts and interruptions in
 
05:20:33.350 --> 05:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
power the grid operators have to make
 
05:20:35.390 --> 05:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
sure that there's always a backup of
 
05:20:38.150 --> 05:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
reliable power ready to keep kick in to
 
05:20:40.368 --> 05:20:40.378 align:start position:0%
keep things running
 
05:20:42.470 --> 05:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
for every extra megawatt produced by
 
05:20:43.910 --> 05:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
solar energy there has to be equal
 
05:20:46.128 --> 05:20:46.138 align:start position:0%
capacity produced by other more reliable
 
05:20:46.138 --> 05:20:47.448 align:start position:0%
capacity produced by other more reliable
methods

05:20:47.448 --> 05:20:47.458 align:start position:0%
methods
 
05:20:49.850 --> 05:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
in conclusion net metering increases
 
05:20:52.550 --> 05:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
costs for ratepayers and still requires
 
05:20:54.590 --> 05:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
building out an equal amount of capacity
 
05:20:57.230 --> 05:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
with other more reliable methods to
 
05:20:58.788 --> 05:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
compensate for when the sun is not
 
05:20:58.798 --> 05:20:59.868 align:start position:0%
compensate for when the sun is not
shining

05:20:59.868 --> 05:20:59.878 align:start position:0%
shining
 
05:21:01.550 --> 05:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
the department of energy does not
 
05:21:03.470 --> 05:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
support this bill and I urge you to vote
 
05:21:08.990 --> 05:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:17.810 --> 05:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:25.490 --> 05:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:27.830 --> 05:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
Clean Energy Technologies have often
 
05:21:29.810 --> 05:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
been accused of not being able to be
 
05:21:32.750 --> 05:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
implemented without subsidies
 
05:21:32.760 --> 05:21:34.250 align:start position:0%
implemented without subsidies
however

05:21:34.250 --> 05:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:21:37.610 --> 05:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
no energy sector has ever been developed
 
05:21:40.550 --> 05:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
without subsidies
 
05:21:42.830 --> 05:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
refer to a great deal in our committee
 
05:21:45.110 --> 05:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
about cost shifting
 
05:21:48.708 --> 05:21:48.718 align:start position:0%
last year the long-awaited dunski report
 
05:21:50.690 --> 05:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
on the New Hampshire value of
 
05:21:53.350 --> 05:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resource concluded
 
05:21:57.170 --> 05:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
that call shifting was less than one
 
05:21:57.180 --> 05:21:59.930 align:start position:0%
that call shifting was less than one
percent

05:21:59.930 --> 05:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:02.208 --> 05:22:02.218 align:start position:0%
to quote Madeleine manal Chief Operating
 
05:22:04.490 --> 05:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
Officer at Essex Hydro
 
05:22:06.830 --> 05:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
now I can finally say there's evidence
 
05:22:09.350 --> 05:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
there's no significant cost shifting
 
05:22:12.190 --> 05:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
considering that we are looking at
 
05:22:15.170 --> 05:22:15.180 align:start position:0%
160 percent Bill increases for energy
 
05:22:16.610 --> 05:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:22:19.070 --> 05:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
going to say that one percent is not
 
05:22:19.080 --> 05:22:21.050 align:start position:0%
going to say that one percent is not
significant

05:22:21.050 --> 05:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
significant
 
05:22:23.030 --> 05:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
I'll be over there
 
05:22:24.590 --> 05:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
well since we are impressed with big
 
05:22:26.750 --> 05:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
numbers there's a few more
 
05:22:29.570 --> 05:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
without a direct 20 billion dollars we
 
05:22:31.610 --> 05:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
annually spend on fossil fuel subsidies
 
05:22:34.570 --> 05:22:34.580 align:start position:0%
we'd all be paying roughly
 
05:22:37.010 --> 05:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
12.75 cents per gallon what do you fill
 
05:22:39.830 --> 05:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:41.868 --> 05:22:41.878 align:start position:0%
the international monetary fund reports
 
05:22:43.368 --> 05:22:43.378 align:start position:0%
that when tax rates and health and
 
05:22:45.170 --> 05:22:45.180 align:start position:0%
environmental damages are not priced on
 
05:22:47.150 --> 05:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
the cost of fossil fuel are included
 
05:22:49.490 --> 05:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
this 20 billion figure
 
05:22:55.070 --> 05:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
quickly Rises to 5.9 trillion or 11
 
05:22:57.650 --> 05:22:57.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars every minute in fossil
 
05:22:59.930 --> 05:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
fuel subsidies
 
05:23:03.288 --> 05:23:03.298 align:start position:0%
to support a non-renewable fuel that
 
05:23:04.970 --> 05:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
eventually price itself out of the
 
05:23:08.628 --> 05:23:08.638 align:start position:0%
market is beyond foolhardy
 
05:23:11.030 --> 05:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
we have better alternatives
 
05:23:13.850 --> 05:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
one is to encourage homegrown energy
 
05:23:15.890 --> 05:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
and raise a limit uh
 
05:23:18.890 --> 05:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
metering limit from one megawatt to five
 
05:23:22.128 --> 05:23:22.138 align:start position:0%
megawatt there's more seats were done
 
05:23:24.170 --> 05:23:24.180 align:start position:0%
it will allow the installers of
 
05:23:26.570 --> 05:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
renewable energy to take advantage of
 
05:23:28.550 --> 05:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
economies of scale
 
05:23:30.948 --> 05:23:30.958 align:start position:0%
a five megawatt system has to
 
05:23:33.830 --> 05:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
significantly shorter payoff period as
 
05:23:36.288 --> 05:23:36.298 align:start position:0%
mostly initial investment is in the
 
05:23:39.050 --> 05:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
interface that connects the grid
 
05:23:42.230 --> 05:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
and not in the generation
 
05:23:44.090 --> 05:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
these generators not only create good
 
05:23:44.100 --> 05:23:45.110 align:start position:0%
these generators not only create good
stability

05:23:45.110 --> 05:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
stability
 
05:23:48.530 --> 05:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
but they also serve as load reducers
 
05:23:50.810 --> 05:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
by way of explanation let me quote from
 
05:23:54.230 --> 05:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
a recent New Hampshire bulletin article
 
05:23:56.330 --> 05:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
producing energy near where it's used
 
05:23:59.150 --> 05:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
saves money by lowering the cost of
 
05:24:01.070 --> 05:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
moving electricity across major high
 
05:24:03.230 --> 05:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
voltage transmission lines that come to
 
05:24:04.128 --> 05:24:04.138 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:24:06.788 --> 05:24:06.798 align:start position:0%
a reduces how many energy utilities have
 
05:24:10.430 --> 05:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
reduces how much energy utilities have
 
05:24:12.350 --> 05:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
to buy from power plants
 
05:24:14.628 --> 05:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
and also decreases how much utilities
 
05:24:17.510 --> 05:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
have to pay plans to meet to be on call
 
05:24:20.150 --> 05:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
to meet demand even when they are not
 
05:24:23.930 --> 05:24:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:25.730 --> 05:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
raising the limit will not result any
 
05:24:27.590 --> 05:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
significant increase in short-term costs
 
05:24:29.448 --> 05:24:29.458 align:start position:0%
but we'll surely have a long-term
 
05:24:32.208 --> 05:24:32.218 align:start position:0%
benefit in cost sustainability and
 
05:24:32.218 --> 05:24:34.490 align:start position:0%
benefit in cost sustainability and
stability

05:24:34.490 --> 05:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
stability
 
05:24:36.350 --> 05:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
I looked at a final reason to raise the
 
05:24:37.910 --> 05:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
net metering cap
 
05:24:39.948 --> 05:24:39.958 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony from the IB
 
05:24:41.510 --> 05:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
International Brotherhood of Electrical
 
05:24:41.520 --> 05:24:43.010 align:start position:0%
International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers

05:24:43.010 --> 05:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
Workers
 
05:24:45.288 --> 05:24:45.298 align:start position:0%
that one of our larger breweries was
 
05:24:46.970 --> 05:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
recently forced to lay off its workers
 
05:24:49.850 --> 05:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
due to the high cost of energy
 
05:24:51.410 --> 05:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
if they could have been reasonably
 
05:24:53.090 --> 05:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
compensated for increasing their one
 
05:24:55.910 --> 05:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
megawatt system to five megawatts they
 
05:24:58.070 --> 05:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
could have avoid these layoffs and kept
 
05:25:00.110 --> 05:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
more New Hampshire dollars in New
 
05:25:00.120 --> 05:25:01.310 align:start position:0%
more New Hampshire dollars in New
Hampshire

05:25:01.310 --> 05:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:25:03.050 --> 05:25:03.060 align:start position:0%
this is not to mention the need for more
 
05:25:04.970 --> 05:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
Electrical Workers to carry out this
 
05:25:09.650 --> 05:25:09.660 align:start position:0%
work and more jobs means a happy economy
 
05:25:11.570 --> 05:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
we'll be voting soon next couple of
 
05:25:13.788 --> 05:25:13.798 align:start position:0%
weeks on a bill to keep Burgess biomass
 
05:25:16.788 --> 05:25:16.798 align:start position:0%
open and I'll confess I see this as a
 
05:25:19.730 --> 05:25:19.740 align:start position:0%
badly needed jobs preservation bill
 
05:25:21.530 --> 05:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
For the Love of those that toil to bring
 
05:25:23.868 --> 05:25:23.878 align:start position:0%
us good ale let's treat them no less
 
05:25:26.090 --> 05:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
fairly let's all take a step in the
 
05:25:28.070 --> 05:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
comics of renewable economics of
 
05:25:30.110 --> 05:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
renewable energy that's surely our
 
05:25:30.120 --> 05:25:32.150 align:start position:0%
renewable energy that's surely our
future

05:25:32.150 --> 05:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:25:34.070 --> 05:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
05:25:35.930 --> 05:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
I'd like to recall a recent email from
 
05:25:38.990 --> 05:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
an oil lobbyist I won't say the name but
 
05:25:43.368 --> 05:25:43.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:45.530 --> 05:25:45.540 align:start position:0%
they warned me of the Litany of demons
 
05:25:47.868 --> 05:25:47.878 align:start position:0%
and snakes that would drain down upon us
 
05:25:50.868 --> 05:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
if this legislation goes forward
 
05:25:52.610 --> 05:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
I think my constituents are more
 
05:25:54.350 --> 05:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
concerned about the demons that arrive
 
05:25:56.990 --> 05:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
monthly in their utility bill than they
 
05:26:01.310 --> 05:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:03.350 --> 05:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
the house is past legislation the race
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
not merely in the past only to see it
 
05:26:07.430 --> 05:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
die in the governor's desk
 
05:26:10.368 --> 05:26:10.378 align:start position:0%
I urge this body to not only pass this
 
05:26:10.378 --> 05:26:11.150 align:start position:0%
I urge this body to not only pass this
bill

05:26:11.150 --> 05:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:26:13.070 --> 05:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
but send a message by passing this bill
 
05:26:19.430 --> 05:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:21.470 --> 05:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is on a pass in
 
05:26:25.730 --> 05:26:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:29.390 --> 05:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me remember yield to questions
 
05:26:35.930 --> 05:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:37.670 --> 05:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and uh thank you
 
05:26:39.530 --> 05:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
05:26:42.230 --> 05:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
if we agree on the laws of supply and
 
05:26:44.690 --> 05:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
demand then is it true that the lower
 
05:26:47.150 --> 05:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
the demand for other energy sources like
 
05:26:50.090 --> 05:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
natural gas the lower the price thank
 
05:26:50.100 --> 05:26:54.530 align:start position:0%
natural gas the lower the price thank
you

05:26:54.530 --> 05:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:57.230 --> 05:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Howard for that
 
05:26:59.270 --> 05:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
question I think it goes without saying
 
05:27:00.770 --> 05:27:00.780 align:start position:0%
that a free enterprise system is
 
05:27:02.750 --> 05:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
dependent upon
 
05:27:05.510 --> 05:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
prices working exactly as you say and I
 
05:27:07.310 --> 05:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
think my constituents understand that as
 
05:27:11.868 --> 05:27:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:14.690 --> 05:27:14.700 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call for a division vote
 
05:27:16.730 --> 05:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
the motion before us has ought to pass
 
05:27:18.948 --> 05:27:18.958 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 523 a division has been
 
05:27:25.430 --> 05:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:27.530 --> 05:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
Senator Sweeney requests a roll call is
 
05:27:30.170 --> 05:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
that sufficiently seconded it is
 
05:27:31.850 --> 05:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded this will be a
 
05:28:29.090 --> 05:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:29.100 --> 05:28:38.628 align:start position:0%
 
player

05:28:38.628 --> 05:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:40.610 --> 05:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
the motion before is a lot of pass in
 
05:28:43.250 --> 05:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
House Bill 523 this is going to be a
 
05:28:45.410 --> 05:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
roll call vote chair recognizing
 
05:28:46.970 --> 05:28:46.980 align:start position:0%
representative votes for parliamentary
 
05:28:46.980 --> 05:28:51.948 align:start position:0%
representative votes for parliamentary
inquiry

05:28:51.948 --> 05:28:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:55.310 --> 05:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:57.770 --> 05:28:57.780 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that expanding net
 
05:29:01.310 --> 05:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
metering increases electricity costs is
 
05:29:03.230 --> 05:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
demonstrated by our state's largest
 
05:29:06.708 --> 05:29:06.718 align:start position:0%
utility collecting 20.4 million dollars
 
05:29:10.190 --> 05:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
from ratepayers for net metering in 2022
 
05:29:10.200 --> 05:29:12.770 align:start position:0%
from ratepayers for net metering in 2022
alone

05:29:12.770 --> 05:29:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:14.810 --> 05:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
but if I know that my esteemed colleague
 
05:29:17.030 --> 05:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
from Marlborough is correct
 
05:29:20.270 --> 05:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
that cost shifting by net metering is
 
05:29:21.948 --> 05:29:21.958 align:start position:0%
only one percent
 
05:29:25.610 --> 05:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
as long as the limit is one megawatt and
 
05:29:27.050 --> 05:29:27.060 align:start position:0%
that it goes up
 
05:29:31.250 --> 05:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:33.590 --> 05:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
if I also know that California recently
 
05:29:37.550 --> 05:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
slashed its net metering subsidies by 75
 
05:29:37.560 --> 05:29:39.110 align:start position:0%
slashed its net metering subsidies by 75
percent

05:29:39.110 --> 05:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:29:41.390 --> 05:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
because climbing electricity costs were
 
05:29:43.550 --> 05:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
harming that State's goal of increasing
 
05:29:47.150 --> 05:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:49.610 --> 05:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
finally if I know that only a commercial
 
05:29:52.010 --> 05:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
developer can afford the capital costs
 
05:29:55.730 --> 05:29:55.740 align:start position:0%
of any project bigger than one megawatt
 
05:29:58.010 --> 05:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
and that subsidizing these businesses
 
05:30:00.708 --> 05:30:00.718 align:start position:0%
for more than that amounts to corporate
 
05:30:00.718 --> 05:30:03.650 align:start position:0%
for more than that amounts to corporate
welfare

05:30:03.650 --> 05:30:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:05.810 --> 05:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
would I now press the red button to
 
05:30:08.030 --> 05:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
prevent seniors and single moms from
 
05:30:11.030 --> 05:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
falling victim to corporate greed thank
 
05:30:13.250 --> 05:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker the chair recognizes
 
05:30:13.260 --> 05:30:14.810 align:start position:0%

05:30:23.390 --> 05:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:25.310 --> 05:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:30:27.530 --> 05:30:27.540 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that this bill
 
05:30:29.750 --> 05:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
would increase the one megawatt net
 
05:30:32.090 --> 05:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
metering cap for all renewable energy
 
05:30:35.208 --> 05:30:35.218 align:start position:0%
projects to a more economical five
 
05:30:37.788 --> 05:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
megawatts limit which would allow for a
 
05:30:40.610 --> 05:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
quicker return on investment than our
 
05:30:44.868 --> 05:30:44.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire businesses are asking for
 
05:30:47.448 --> 05:30:47.458 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill would make
 
05:30:50.030 --> 05:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
net metering invisible at the bulk power
 
05:30:50.040 --> 05:30:51.050 align:start position:0%
net metering invisible at the bulk power
level

05:30:51.050 --> 05:30:51.060 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:30:54.230 --> 05:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
and save transmission cost resulting in
 
05:30:57.470 --> 05:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
directly benefiting rate payers
 
05:31:00.530 --> 05:31:00.540 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that this bill is
 
05:31:02.750 --> 05:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
desired by our New Hampshire businesses
 
05:31:05.330 --> 05:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
and would help them with their bottom
 
05:31:08.150 --> 05:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
line and that this bill is a business
 
05:31:11.510 --> 05:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
friendly moderate approach to net
 
05:31:13.788 --> 05:31:13.798 align:start position:0%
metering that will help our New
 
05:31:17.690 --> 05:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses stay competitive
 
05:31:21.170 --> 05:31:21.180 align:start position:0%
would I now ensure our businesses are
 
05:31:24.410 --> 05:31:24.420 align:start position:0%
heard and remain competitive by pressing
 
05:31:28.490 --> 05:31:28.500 align:start position:0%

million dollars under Reggie
 
06:04:10.970 --> 06:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
by Statute we can only use the first
 
06:04:14.208 --> 06:04:14.218 align:start position:0%
dollar of our allowances to fund energy
 
06:04:16.910 --> 06:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
improvements last year the average was
 
06:04:19.788 --> 06:04:19.798 align:start position:0%
about 13 as my colleague from Lancaster
 
06:04:22.970 --> 06:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
mentioned currently in March the
 
06:04:25.208 --> 06:04:25.218 align:start position:0%
allowance is 12.50 so around the same
 
06:04:28.250 --> 06:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
but less than seven percent of that
 
06:04:32.330 --> 06:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
money gets used for its intended purpose
 
06:04:34.730 --> 06:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
and remember we've been spending the
 
06:04:37.430 --> 06:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
Reggie money this way for years
 
06:04:40.010 --> 06:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
giving 93 percent of our investment

06:04:47.110 --> 06:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has received
 
06:04:50.510 --> 06:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
262 million dollars over the life of the

06:04:52.010 --> 06:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:04:54.590 --> 06:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
and what do we have to show for it
 
06:04:56.830 --> 06:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
if we keep doing what we've been doing
 
06:04:59.750 --> 06:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
which is the absolute minimum
 
06:05:01.850 --> 06:05:01.860 align:start position:0%
then we cannot claim that we're doing
 
06:05:03.830 --> 06:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
all that we can to help people lower
 
06:05:06.470 --> 06:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
their bills and deal with the high cost
 
06:05:07.670 --> 06:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
of energy
 
06:05:10.250 --> 06:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
it's really simple no investment no
 
06:05:10.260 --> 06:05:11.628 align:start position:0%
it's really simple no investment no
return

06:05:11.628 --> 06:05:11.638 align:start position:0%
return
 
06:05:14.510 --> 06:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
it's not taking money from people which
 
06:05:16.430 --> 06:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
is one way to spin it
 
06:05:19.190 --> 06:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's putting some of that money where it
 
06:05:21.708 --> 06:05:21.718 align:start position:0%
could actually do them some good
 
06:05:24.650 --> 06:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
the bill asks us to increase that one
 
06:05:24.660 --> 06:05:25.910 align:start position:0%
the bill asks us to increase that one
dollar

06:05:25.910 --> 06:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
06:05:27.470 --> 06:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
seven percent
 
06:05:30.948 --> 06:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
to three dollars so tripling our money
 
06:05:33.890 --> 06:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
to make investments
 
06:05:37.190 --> 06:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
um and that would
 
06:05:41.030 --> 06:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh turn into approximately 20 percent or
 
06:05:44.270 --> 06:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
yeah seven percent times three is 21 but
 
06:05:47.270 --> 06:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
just under 21 percent
 
06:05:49.670 --> 06:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
but we would still be rebating eighty
 
06:05:51.890 --> 06:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
percent of the funding onto the utility
 
06:05:55.070 --> 06:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
bills of the customers so this is truly
 
06:05:58.190 --> 06:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
a compromise as my caucus believes we
 
06:05:59.810 --> 06:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
should be using eighty percent for
 
06:06:02.868 --> 06:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
energy transition and
 
06:06:04.910 --> 06:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
um like the other 10 states in Reggie
 
06:06:05.990 --> 06:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
are doing
 
06:06:09.048 --> 06:06:09.058 align:start position:0%
but having twenty percent of the annual
 
06:06:11.990 --> 06:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
funding gives us at least a chance to
 
06:06:14.030 --> 06:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
make the money work for our constituents
 
06:06:16.150 --> 06:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
to do some things that are interesting
 
06:06:18.590 --> 06:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
and to try and keep up in terms of
 
06:06:21.288 --> 06:06:21.298 align:start position:0%
competitiveness we can give them supply
 
06:06:24.650 --> 06:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
and demand side options
 
06:06:27.110 --> 06:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
and truly bring down costs
 
06:06:30.530 --> 06:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
we are not spendthrifts in New Hampshire
 
06:06:32.810 --> 06:06:32.820 align:start position:0%
but we're not fools either
 
06:06:35.270 --> 06:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
our lack of progress on local
 
06:06:37.970 --> 06:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
sustainable energy has increased our
 
06:06:39.948 --> 06:06:39.958 align:start position:0%
share of the regional transmission costs
 
06:06:41.628 --> 06:06:41.638 align:start position:0%
on that Regional grid
 
06:06:44.150 --> 06:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
we don't have to be the only state
 
06:06:47.150 --> 06:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
member of Reggie who isn't seeing the
 
06:06:49.310 --> 06:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
benefits of this wildly successful
 
06:06:52.910 --> 06:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
program we can do something today
 
06:06:55.368 --> 06:06:55.378 align:start position:0%
if you told your constituents that you
 
06:06:56.690 --> 06:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
were going to do something to lower
 
06:06:59.510 --> 06:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
energy bills then you can point to this
 
06:06:59.520 --> 06:07:00.410 align:start position:0%
energy bills then you can point to this
boat

06:07:00.410 --> 06:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
boat
 
06:07:02.090 --> 06:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
as your follow through on that
 
06:07:07.430 --> 06:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:09.948 --> 06:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
representative San Antonio has requested
 
06:07:12.470 --> 06:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote in that is sufficiently
 
06:07:14.750 --> 06:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
seconded members take their seats this
 
06:07:58.070 --> 06:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:00.288 --> 06:08:00.298 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is ought to pass on
 
06:08:02.208 --> 06:08:02.218 align:start position:0%
House Bill 524
 
06:08:04.730 --> 06:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a roll call vote did
 
06:08:06.230 --> 06:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
I recognize representative votes for
 
06:08:11.270 --> 06:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:14.690 --> 06:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:16.368 --> 06:08:16.378 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that the word
 
06:08:20.868 --> 06:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
Investments is another term for taxes
 
06:08:22.910 --> 06:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill reduces
 
06:08:25.368 --> 06:08:25.378 align:start position:0%
Reggie ratepayer rebates
 
06:08:27.410 --> 06:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
and will cost 70 million in the coming
 
06:08:27.420 --> 06:08:29.510 align:start position:0%
and will cost 70 million in the coming
decade

06:08:29.510 --> 06:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
decade
 
06:08:32.270 --> 06:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
if I also know that efficiency increases
 
06:08:34.548 --> 06:08:34.558 align:start position:0%
energy Demand by making products and
 
06:08:37.788 --> 06:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
services more affordable
 
06:08:39.948 --> 06:08:39.958 align:start position:0%
finally if I know that cost increases
 
06:08:42.288 --> 06:08:42.298 align:start position:0%
this past year for home heating road
 
06:08:44.810 --> 06:08:44.820 align:start position:0%
travel and lighting our homes have hit
 
06:08:47.270 --> 06:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
near record levels
 
06:08:49.368 --> 06:08:49.378 align:start position:0%
would I now press the red button to
 
06:08:51.770 --> 06:08:51.780 align:start position:0%
allow beleaguered energy buyers to catch
 
06:08:55.490 --> 06:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
a breather from Relentless price spikes
 
06:08:57.770 --> 06:08:57.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:08:59.208 --> 06:08:59.218 align:start position:0%
do you reckon
 
06:09:01.548 --> 06:09:01.558 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary inquiry thank you Mr
 
06:09:01.558 --> 06:09:02.750 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary inquiry thank you Mr
Speaker

06:09:02.750 --> 06:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
06:09:05.030 --> 06:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
if I know that New Hampshire rate payers
 
06:09:07.368 --> 06:09:07.378 align:start position:0%
are not benefiting from the rebate
 
06:09:09.830 --> 06:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
program that was in place when they saw
 
06:09:11.570 --> 06:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
their bills go up by hundreds of dollars
 
06:09:14.330 --> 06:09:14.340 align:start position:0%
last year and if I know that an increase
 
06:09:17.510 --> 06:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
in energy program funding from 7 to 20
 
06:09:20.810 --> 06:09:20.820 align:start position:0%
percent would mean we could do more than
 
06:09:22.430 --> 06:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
just Energy Efficiency to help people
 
06:09:25.190 --> 06:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
lower their energy costs and finally if
 
06:09:27.890 --> 06:09:27.900 align:start position:0%
I know that rebating 80 percent of the
 
06:09:29.868 --> 06:09:29.878 align:start position:0%
regi funds to electric bills instead of
 
06:09:32.990 --> 06:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
93 percent is a fiscally responsible
 
06:09:36.110 --> 06:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
compromise that won't do all that Reggie
 
06:09:38.150 --> 06:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
can do for New Hampshire but it will
 
06:09:38.160 --> 06:09:39.110 align:start position:0%
can do for New Hampshire but it will
help

06:09:39.110 --> 06:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
help
 
06:09:41.390 --> 06:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
then would I now press the green button
 
06:09:43.128 --> 06:09:43.138 align:start position:0%
to give consumers the choices they
 
06:09:46.368 --> 06:09:46.378 align:start position:0%
deserve to lower their costs thank you
 
06:09:48.410 --> 06:09:48.420 align:start position:0%

06:10:53.390 --> 06:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
for what reason does a member rise I
 
06:10:55.128 --> 06:10:55.138 align:start position:0%
move in expedient to legislate Mr
 
06:10:57.650 --> 06:10:57.660 align:start position:0%

06:10:59.448 --> 06:10:59.458 align:start position:0%
is in expedient to legislate on House

I come here opposed to hb605 for a
 
06:16:17.510 --> 06:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
couple of separate reasons first is I
 
06:16:19.010 --> 06:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
think everybody in this room and
 
06:16:20.270 --> 06:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
everybody in New Hampshire has been
 
06:16:22.610 --> 06:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
inundated with climate change global
 
06:16:25.010 --> 06:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
warming information no one is ignorant
 
06:16:27.470 --> 06:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
of the issue everybody is informed which
 
06:16:29.150 --> 06:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
is good it's good to have an informed
 
06:16:31.490 --> 06:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
public we also in New Hampshire have a
 
06:16:33.048 --> 06:16:33.058 align:start position:0%
thing called Electric Choice everybody
 
06:16:35.628 --> 06:16:35.638 align:start position:0%
gets to choose their electric supplier
 
06:16:37.850 --> 06:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
they can choose based on cost or they
 
06:16:39.170 --> 06:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
can choose based on the type of
 
06:16:40.850 --> 06:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
electricity being produced they can get
 
06:16:43.788 --> 06:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
all win for example and probably get all
 
06:16:46.128 --> 06:16:46.138 align:start position:0%
solar for if they wanted to but this
 
06:16:48.590 --> 06:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
bill says we don't want to give those
 
06:16:51.470 --> 06:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
informed rate payers the ability to make
 
06:16:53.090 --> 06:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
that decision we don't think they're
 
06:16:56.150 --> 06:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
smart enough this bill says no no no we
 
06:16:57.948 --> 06:16:57.958 align:start position:0%
can't trust the rate payers in New
 
06:16:59.150 --> 06:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to make the right decision
 
06:17:00.410 --> 06:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
when it comes to what type of
 
06:17:03.288 --> 06:17:03.298 align:start position:0%
electricity to buy we the state are so
 
06:17:06.230 --> 06:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
much smarter we must do that for them so
 
06:17:07.850 --> 06:17:07.860 align:start position:0%
we are not going to allow them to do
 
06:17:09.530 --> 06:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
that in fact we're going to increase the
 
06:17:12.048 --> 06:17:12.058 align:start position:0%
amount of solar electricity they're
 
06:17:14.390 --> 06:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
required to purchase up to 25 percent of
 
06:17:16.368 --> 06:17:16.378 align:start position:0%
their total so that's the philosophical
 
06:17:18.948 --> 06:17:18.958 align:start position:0%
reason the Practical reason is it's
 
06:17:21.350 --> 06:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
never going to happen ISO New England
 
06:17:23.090 --> 06:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
estimates the electric consumption in
 
06:17:24.288 --> 06:17:24.298 align:start position:0%
New England and New Hampshire will
 
06:17:26.628 --> 06:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
double by the year 2050. that's because
 
06:17:28.190 --> 06:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
of addition of all these electric
 
06:17:31.430 --> 06:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
vehicles and electric heating so given
 
06:17:31.440 --> 06:17:32.330 align:start position:0%
vehicles and electric heating so given
that

06:17:32.330 --> 06:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:17:34.850 --> 06:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
is going to produce 25 percent of the
 
06:17:36.350 --> 06:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
electricity consumed in New Hampshire
 
06:17:39.410 --> 06:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
would take up thousands and thousands of
 
06:17:41.570 --> 06:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
Acres of solar panels somewhere in the
 
06:17:43.490 --> 06:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
vicinity of twenty thousand to thirty
 
06:17:45.470 --> 06:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
thousand depending on what estimate you
 
06:17:47.990 --> 06:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
want to use for how much acreage one
 
06:17:50.750 --> 06:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
make wad of solar picks now remember the
 
06:17:52.250 --> 06:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
big thing to remember about solar is
 
06:17:55.850 --> 06:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
it's 13 and a half percent efficiency it
 
06:17:59.330 --> 06:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
when it comes to capacity Factor so for
 
06:18:01.548 --> 06:18:01.558 align:start position:0%
example something like a combined cycle
 
06:18:05.270 --> 06:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
gas plant is maybe 90 capacity Factor
 
06:18:08.448 --> 06:18:08.458 align:start position:0%
solar is 13 and a half percent so you
 
06:18:11.090 --> 06:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
have to have many many more megawatts of
 
06:18:12.590 --> 06:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
solar to produce the same as you would
 
06:18:14.868 --> 06:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
from a combined cycle gas plant
 
06:18:18.230 --> 06:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
now to put this in perspective thousands
 
06:18:20.030 --> 06:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
and thousands of Acres like I said of
 
06:18:22.730 --> 06:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
solar panels even if we got say a
 
06:18:24.830 --> 06:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
quarter of those maybe four to five
 
06:18:27.230 --> 06:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
thousand acres of behind the meter solar
 
06:18:30.128 --> 06:18:30.138 align:start position:0%
which means backyard solar rooftop solar
 
06:18:33.530 --> 06:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
Factory roof solar 5 000 Acres that's an
 
06:18:35.570 --> 06:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
enormous amount of solar panels we'd
 
06:18:37.250 --> 06:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
still be left with about fifteen
 
06:18:39.048 --> 06:18:39.058 align:start position:0%
thousand acres that we'd have to come up
 
06:18:40.910 --> 06:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
with where can we get that acreage in
 
06:18:42.830 --> 06:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire only one place by mowing
 
06:18:45.350 --> 06:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
down forests completely clear cutting
 
06:18:47.208 --> 06:18:47.218 align:start position:0%
Forest to the ground to put it into
 
06:18:47.218 --> 06:18:48.590 align:start position:0%
Forest to the ground to put it into
perspective

06:18:48.590 --> 06:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
06:18:50.750 --> 06:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
Pawtuckaway State Park is about five
 
06:18:52.970 --> 06:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
thousand square up five thousand acres
 
06:18:55.430 --> 06:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
so we would have to cover the patakaway
 
06:18:57.890 --> 06:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
state park mow down every tree cover up
 
06:18:59.930 --> 06:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
even the lakes and streams and that
 
06:19:02.150 --> 06:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
would give us a third of what we need to
 
06:19:04.610 --> 06:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
cover what this bill wants us to do so I
 
06:19:06.288 --> 06:19:06.298 align:start position:0%
ask where are we going to come up with
 
06:19:09.708 --> 06:19:09.718 align:start position:0%
these 15 000 Acres of forests that we're
 
06:19:10.970 --> 06:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
going to mow down in New Hampshire and
 
06:19:12.470 --> 06:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
by the way those forests are absorbing
 
06:19:14.390 --> 06:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases right now they wouldn't
 
06:19:15.770 --> 06:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
be doing that when they were replaced
 
06:19:18.410 --> 06:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
with solar panels so this idea came from
 
06:19:20.868 --> 06:19:20.878 align:start position:0%
Fantasyland and it belongs there let's
 
06:19:22.910 --> 06:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
leave it and fan let's leave Fantasyland
 
06:19:25.368 --> 06:19:25.378 align:start position:0%
in Disney World where it belongs and
 
06:19:29.510 --> 06:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:34.850 --> 06:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:38.690 --> 06:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:41.448 --> 06:19:41.458 align:start position:0%
remember it does not yield
 
06:19:49.610 --> 06:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:51.890 --> 06:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:19:55.250 --> 06:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
good afternoon colleagues
 
06:19:57.948 --> 06:19:57.958 align:start position:0%
HP 605 is a straight it's very
 
06:20:00.230 --> 06:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
straightforward IT addresses only the
 
06:20:02.930 --> 06:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
solar component of our renewable energy
 
06:20:05.990 --> 06:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard
 
06:20:08.270 --> 06:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
as you know the RPS is the policy that
 
06:20:09.830 --> 06:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
requires our state's distribution
 
06:20:11.868 --> 06:20:11.878 align:start position:0%
utilities to include in the electric
 
06:20:15.110 --> 06:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
supply that they procure on our behalf
 
06:20:17.090 --> 06:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
a gradually increasing amount of
 
06:20:18.910 --> 06:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
06:20:22.070 --> 06:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
hb605 would require modest increases in
 
06:20:23.750 --> 06:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
the amount of solar energy that they
 
06:20:27.410 --> 06:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
procure every year from now where we're
 
06:20:30.590 --> 06:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
at a box about two percent to ultimately
 
06:20:34.910 --> 06:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
achieve as my colleague stated 25
 
06:20:37.250 --> 06:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
percent of our energy from solar by
 
06:20:37.260 --> 06:20:38.868 align:start position:0%
percent of our energy from solar by
2050.

06:20:38.868 --> 06:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
2050.
 
06:20:42.170 --> 06:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear that's 25 percent by
 
06:20:45.110 --> 06:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
27 years from now
 
06:20:47.330 --> 06:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
if you think that's too ambitious let me
 
06:20:49.730 --> 06:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
remind you that New Hampshire among all
 
06:20:52.430 --> 06:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
the states in New England has by far by
 
06:20:55.070 --> 06:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
far the least ambitious renewable
 
06:20:57.590 --> 06:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard I'm not allowed to
 
06:21:00.590 --> 06:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
use props up here but if I were you'd
 
06:21:03.590 --> 06:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
see graphs with lines representing every
 
06:21:05.990 --> 06:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
other state going like this over time
 
06:21:08.770 --> 06:21:08.780 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire is like this
 
06:21:08.780 --> 06:21:10.670 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire is like this
flatlined

06:21:10.670 --> 06:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
flatlined
 
06:21:12.548 --> 06:21:12.558 align:start position:0%
despite this
 
06:21:15.670 --> 06:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
I'll respectfully call it
 
06:21:19.070 --> 06:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
conservative approach with regard to
 
06:21:21.288 --> 06:21:21.298 align:start position:0%
renewable energy New Hampshire doesn't
 
06:21:21.298 --> 06:21:22.250 align:start position:0%
renewable energy New Hampshire doesn't
have

06:21:22.250 --> 06:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:21:24.650 --> 06:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
lower utility rates than any other state
 
06:21:26.810 --> 06:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
in New England that's because when it
 
06:21:28.850 --> 06:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
comes to Energy prices
 
06:21:31.490 --> 06:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
we're all in the same boat
 
06:21:33.170 --> 06:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire utilities buy their
 
06:21:34.970 --> 06:21:34.980 align:start position:0%
electricity from the regional power pool
 
06:21:38.270 --> 06:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
and in 2023 more than 50 percent of
 
06:21:40.610 --> 06:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
electricity in the region is produced by
 
06:21:43.310 --> 06:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
power plants burning natural gas
 
06:21:45.890 --> 06:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
at times of peak demand the power plants
 
06:21:48.890 --> 06:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
burning oil come online and they
 
06:21:50.890 --> 06:21:50.900 align:start position:0%
contribute extremely expensive
 
06:21:53.690 --> 06:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
electricity to the supply so the rate
 
06:21:56.090 --> 06:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
shock that all electricity customers in
 
06:21:58.610 --> 06:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which is have experienced
 
06:22:01.548 --> 06:22:01.558 align:start position:0%
in the wake of world events and the past
 
06:22:03.770 --> 06:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
year is a direct result of this over
 
06:22:03.780 --> 06:22:05.208 align:start position:0%
year is a direct result of this over
dependence

06:22:05.208 --> 06:22:05.218 align:start position:0%
dependence
 
06:22:07.490 --> 06:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
on a resource that New Hampshire has
 
06:22:09.650 --> 06:22:09.660 align:start position:0%
none of
 
06:22:13.310 --> 06:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
we are not West Virginia Texas Wyoming
 
06:22:16.610 --> 06:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma or even Pennsylvania
 
06:22:18.350 --> 06:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire just like every other
 
06:22:21.948 --> 06:22:21.958 align:start position:0%
state in New England has no natural gas
 
06:22:25.128 --> 06:22:25.138 align:start position:0%
no fossil fuel of any kind
 
06:22:27.708 --> 06:22:27.718 align:start position:0%
but unlike every new other New England
 
06:22:30.410 --> 06:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
state New Hampshire remains stubbornly
 
06:22:32.270 --> 06:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
resistant to policies that would
 
06:22:35.390 --> 06:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
diversify our energy Supply
 
06:22:38.090 --> 06:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
stubbornly dependent and dare I say
 
06:22:41.150 --> 06:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
addicted to fossil fuels
 
06:22:43.010 --> 06:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire has no fossil
 
06:22:44.990 --> 06:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
fuels because we're so dependent on
 
06:22:47.390 --> 06:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
these Commodities whose prices are set
 
06:22:49.850 --> 06:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
on the global market all New Hampshire
 
06:22:52.788 --> 06:22:52.798 align:start position:0%
residents and businesses are price
 
06:22:52.798 --> 06:22:54.708 align:start position:0%
residents and businesses are price
takers

06:22:54.708 --> 06:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
takers
 
06:22:57.110 --> 06:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's Global supply and demand world
 
06:23:00.230 --> 06:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
events like Wars terrorist attacks
 
06:23:03.110 --> 06:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
hurricanes and the Gulf of Mexico ships
 
06:23:05.030 --> 06:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
getting stuck sideways in canals
 
06:23:08.150 --> 06:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:10.850 --> 06:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
that those things determine
 
06:23:13.548 --> 06:23:13.558 align:start position:0%
the price ups and downs of fossil fuels
 
06:23:16.190 --> 06:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
and electricity rates we have no control
 
06:23:19.128 --> 06:23:19.138 align:start position:0%
our dependence on natural gas and oil
 
06:23:21.650 --> 06:23:21.660 align:start position:0%
for the vast majority of heating and
 
06:23:23.330 --> 06:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
nearly 60 percent of electricity
 
06:23:25.788 --> 06:23:25.798 align:start position:0%
electric generation at peak times is an
 
06:23:29.510 --> 06:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
enormous vulnerability for New Hampshire
 
06:23:32.690 --> 06:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
this dependence and vulnerability to the
 
06:23:34.788 --> 06:23:34.798 align:start position:0%
global fossil fuel Market are contrary
 
06:23:37.128 --> 06:23:37.138 align:start position:0%
to the prize New Hampshire values of
 
06:23:40.490 --> 06:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
self-reliance and Independence and
 
06:23:42.590 --> 06:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
furthermore the six more than six
 
06:23:44.990 --> 06:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
billion dollars we spend on fossil fuels
 
06:23:46.730 --> 06:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
every year
 
06:23:50.330 --> 06:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
yeah 500 million dollars a month
 
06:23:52.368 --> 06:23:52.378 align:start position:0%
represents over two percent of our
 
06:23:55.490 --> 06:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
state's GDP we send it out of state
 
06:23:58.670 --> 06:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
to power our economy but it's lost
 
06:24:01.670 --> 06:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity it's an export of our wealth
 
06:24:04.190 --> 06:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
and resources it's our money literally
 
06:24:07.970 --> 06:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:09.830 --> 06:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
now in policy discussions like this
 
06:24:12.948 --> 06:24:12.958 align:start position:0%
within our committee and without uh
 
06:24:14.510 --> 06:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
discussions of friends on the other side
 
06:24:16.788 --> 06:24:16.798 align:start position:0%
of the aisle I often hear references to
 
06:24:18.830 --> 06:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
the free market how we shouldn't be
 
06:24:20.270 --> 06:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
meddling in the free market with
 
06:24:22.310 --> 06:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
policies like this we should let the
 
06:24:24.530 --> 06:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
free market work in the belief that that
 
06:24:26.270 --> 06:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
will bring us the lowest possible prices
 
06:24:28.730 --> 06:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
well how do you like 22 cents per
 
06:24:30.890 --> 06:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour of electricity
 
06:24:33.350 --> 06:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
brought to you by that free market for
 
06:24:35.030 --> 06:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels
 
06:24:37.128 --> 06:24:37.138 align:start position:0%
the electricity and natural price shock
 
06:24:39.170 --> 06:24:39.180 align:start position:0%
that we all experienced last year and
 
06:24:40.548 --> 06:24:40.558 align:start position:0%
which looks like it's going to continue
 
06:24:42.170 --> 06:24:42.180 align:start position:0%
for quite a while
 
06:24:44.510 --> 06:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
this is strongest possible evidence of
 
06:24:46.670 --> 06:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
this vulnerability
 
06:24:49.548 --> 06:24:49.558 align:start position:0%
in fact there's nothing free about the
 
06:24:51.708 --> 06:24:51.718 align:start position:0%
electricity and gas utility markets in
 
06:24:54.170 --> 06:24:54.180 align:start position:0%
our state or any state the
 
06:24:56.510 --> 06:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
electricity and gas utility businesses
 
06:24:57.910 --> 06:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
that we have today are
 
06:25:00.288 --> 06:25:00.298 align:start position:0%
government-sanctioned monopolies created
 
06:25:03.650 --> 06:25:03.660 align:start position:0%
over a century ago of necessity to bring
 
06:25:06.350 --> 06:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
the massive Distribution Systems that we
 
06:25:08.390 --> 06:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
have today into existence
 
06:25:11.090 --> 06:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
they operate completely within the rules
 
06:25:13.548 --> 06:25:13.558 align:start position:0%
according to the incentives and toward
 
06:25:16.970 --> 06:25:16.980 align:start position:0%
the goals that we policy makers set for
 
06:25:16.980 --> 06:25:17.750 align:start position:0%
the goals that we policy makers set for
them

06:25:17.750 --> 06:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:25:20.030 --> 06:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
so if we care about the prices that our
 
06:25:21.890 --> 06:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
constituents see in this captive Market
 
06:25:24.590 --> 06:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
if we care about rates and costs that
 
06:25:26.390 --> 06:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
they face
 
06:25:29.150 --> 06:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
we must use every tool that we have to
 
06:25:32.270 --> 06:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
achieve increased portfolio diversity
 
06:25:34.190 --> 06:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
that enhances our strength and
 
06:25:36.170 --> 06:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
resilience in the face of global fossil
 
06:25:38.990 --> 06:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
fuel markets diversity reduces risk
 
06:25:41.690 --> 06:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
solar energy on the grid reduces demand
 
06:25:43.610 --> 06:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
for fossil fuels
 
06:25:46.310 --> 06:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
especially at peak times when the spot
 
06:25:49.670 --> 06:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
market prices are highest
 
06:25:52.670 --> 06:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
and thus it lowers costs lowers rates
 
06:25:53.810 --> 06:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
for everyone
 
06:25:57.110 --> 06:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
the costs of implementing the RPS that
 
06:26:02.150 --> 06:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
you'll likely hear about in a in a pi
 
06:26:04.970 --> 06:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
represent the investment in achieving
 
06:26:07.730 --> 06:26:07.740 align:start position:0%
that portfolio diversity
 
06:26:09.890 --> 06:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
as I said the global situation with
 
06:26:11.570 --> 06:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
respect to natural gas prices is not
 
06:26:14.390 --> 06:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
going to alleviate anytime soon
 
06:26:16.250 --> 06:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
the global price is going to remain high
 
06:26:17.868 --> 06:26:17.878 align:start position:0%
so we need to change what we're doing
 
06:26:19.430 --> 06:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
06:26:22.010 --> 06:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
solar energy all renewable energy has
 
06:26:24.948 --> 06:26:24.958 align:start position:0%
the singular virtue of having zero fuel
 
06:26:24.958 --> 06:26:26.150 align:start position:0%
the singular virtue of having zero fuel
costs

06:26:26.150 --> 06:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
costs
 
06:26:28.610 --> 06:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
yeah let me repeat that zero fuel costs
 
06:26:32.330 --> 06:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
right it's just investment in capital
 
06:26:35.208 --> 06:26:35.218 align:start position:0%
the RPS is an important policy signal
 
06:26:37.788 --> 06:26:37.798 align:start position:0%
that says to Private Industry build more
 
06:26:42.288 --> 06:26:42.298 align:start position:0%
solar the kind that has zero fuel costs
 
06:26:45.288 --> 06:26:45.298 align:start position:0%
so it's policy makers responsibility our
 
06:26:47.868 --> 06:26:47.878 align:start position:0%
constituents expect us to have the
 
06:26:49.610 --> 06:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
foresight and the willingness to
 
06:26:51.350 --> 06:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
understand the complicated energy
 
06:26:51.360 --> 06:26:53.810 align:start position:0%
understand the complicated energy
landscape

06:26:53.810 --> 06:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
landscape
 
06:26:55.788 --> 06:26:55.798 align:start position:0%
understand the capabilities and
 
06:26:58.788 --> 06:26:58.798 align:start position:0%
advantages offered by new technology and
 
06:27:01.010 --> 06:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
make policies that look over the horizon
 
06:27:05.090 --> 06:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
to where we need to be 5 10 15 20 years
 
06:27:07.730 --> 06:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
from now and we need to begin to turn
 
06:27:10.010 --> 06:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
the massive ship that is our Energy
 
06:27:10.020 --> 06:27:11.030 align:start position:0%

06:27:14.090 --> 06:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
we must evolve the system to meet 21st
 
06:27:16.128 --> 06:27:16.138 align:start position:0%
century imperatives and goals by taking
 
06:27:19.250 --> 06:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
advantage of 21st century technology
 
06:27:22.010 --> 06:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
send the right signals to this Market to
 
06:27:23.868 --> 06:27:23.878 align:start position:0%
ensure it evolves to encourage and
 
06:27:26.628 --> 06:27:26.638 align:start position:0%
support a more diverse renewable energy
 
06:27:30.350 --> 06:27:30.360 align:start position:0%

06:27:36.480 --> 06:27:38.570 align:start position:0%
over which did I mention we have no
control

06:27:38.570 --> 06:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
control
 
06:27:41.510 --> 06:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
the RP in conclusion the RPS is a key
 
06:27:44.270 --> 06:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
instrument an important Market signal to
 
06:27:46.310 --> 06:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
achieve greater fuel diversity and
 
06:27:48.230 --> 06:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
decrease exposure to those markets
 
06:27:49.970 --> 06:27:49.980 align:start position:0%
that's why it's used by more than
 
06:27:53.390 --> 06:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of states in the nation
 
06:27:55.010 --> 06:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should strengthen our
 
06:27:58.910 --> 06:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
anemic RPS and HP 605 would do that on a
 
06:28:00.830 --> 06:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
schedule and at percentages for new
 
06:28:03.530 --> 06:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
solar that would still be well less than
 
06:28:05.690 --> 06:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
every one of our fellow New England
 
06:28:05.700 --> 06:28:07.910 align:start position:0%

interference
 
06:29:35.570 --> 06:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
and that this bill increases subsidies
 
06:29:40.548 --> 06:29:40.558 align:start position:0%
for solar energy by 300 percent by 2024
 
06:29:43.670 --> 06:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
at a cost of almost 12 million dollars
 
06:29:47.270 --> 06:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:49.490 --> 06:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
if I also know that this bill increases
 
06:29:52.548 --> 06:29:52.558 align:start position:0%
rate payer costs by 400 million dollars
 
06:29:56.330 --> 06:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
over the next decade
 
06:29:58.670 --> 06:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
finally if I know that solar systems
 
06:30:01.010 --> 06:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
provide usable energy in our Northern
 
06:30:04.250 --> 06:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
State at only 13.5 percent of A System's
 
06:30:06.288 --> 06:30:06.298 align:start position:0%
rated size
 
06:30:08.448 --> 06:30:08.458 align:start position:0%
what I now press the red button to
 
06:30:10.548 --> 06:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
prevent crippling future generations of
 
06:30:13.490 --> 06:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
rate pairs with costs for a fabled
 
06:30:15.470 --> 06:30:15.480 align:start position:0%

06:30:17.390 --> 06:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:30:19.310 --> 06:30:19.320 align:start position:0%

06:30:25.670 --> 06:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:30:28.548 --> 06:30:28.558 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that fossil fuels
 
06:30:31.250 --> 06:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
such as natural gas are expensive are
 
06:30:34.070 --> 06:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
subject to price spikes emit carbon and
 
06:30:36.410 --> 06:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
cause money to leave the state when we
 
06:30:37.788 --> 06:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
rely on them
 
06:30:40.190 --> 06:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
and if I know that for every additional
 
06:30:42.590 --> 06:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
megawatt of solar energy that we use
 
06:30:45.650 --> 06:30:45.660 align:start position:0%
that is one less megawatt of energy from
 
06:30:47.930 --> 06:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels that we need to buy and
 
06:30:47.940 --> 06:30:48.890 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels that we need to buy and
burn

06:30:48.890 --> 06:30:48.900 align:start position:0%
burn
 
06:30:51.708 --> 06:30:51.718 align:start position:0%
and if I know that solar energy has no
 
06:30:54.350 --> 06:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
fuel cost produces no carbon or other
 
06:30:57.350 --> 06:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
pollutants and can be made right here in
 
06:31:00.410 --> 06:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire then Mr Speaker would I

could change to A Rose by Any Other Name
 
06:36:34.850 --> 06:36:34.860 align:start position:0%
is still a rose
 
06:36:37.730 --> 06:36:37.740 align:start position:0%
and there's enough changes in hcl4 to
 
06:36:40.070 --> 06:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
let this bill stand alone
 
06:36:43.810 --> 06:36:43.820 align:start position:0%
however some of the language is so
 
06:36:47.150 --> 06:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
familiar to all of us and so close to
 
06:36:50.830 --> 06:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
what we saw in hcir1 the Article 5
 
06:36:53.270 --> 06:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention
 
06:36:55.670 --> 06:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
that it could be that Rose

06:37:02.810 --> 06:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
this bill does talk about term limits
 
06:37:04.850 --> 06:37:04.860 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure my friend from Danville
 
06:37:06.410 --> 06:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
will cover that
 
06:37:08.208 --> 06:37:08.218 align:start position:0%
but let me just take a moment to read
 
06:37:11.750 --> 06:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph of hcr4 and see if
 
06:37:13.610 --> 06:37:13.620 align:start position:0%
it brings back memories to you like it
 
06:37:15.350 --> 06:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
did to me
 
06:37:18.110 --> 06:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
whereas Article 5 of The Constitution of
 
06:37:20.390 --> 06:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
the United States of America requires a
 
06:37:22.970 --> 06:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
convention be called by Congress of the
 
06:37:24.948 --> 06:37:24.958 align:start position:0%
United States for the purpose proposing
 
06:37:27.350 --> 06:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the Constitution upon
 
06:37:29.690 --> 06:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
application of two-thirds of the
 
06:37:32.570 --> 06:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
legislatures of the several States
 
06:37:35.570 --> 06:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
in the next to the last paragraph of the
 
06:37:35.580 --> 06:37:36.530 align:start position:0%
in the next to the last paragraph of the
bill

06:37:36.530 --> 06:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:37:39.048 --> 06:37:39.058 align:start position:0%
that this application constitutes a
 
06:37:41.510 --> 06:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
continuing application in accordance
 
06:37:43.548 --> 06:37:43.558 align:start position:0%
with Article 5 of The Constitution of
 
06:37:46.010 --> 06:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
the United States of America until the
 
06:37:47.930 --> 06:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
legislature of at least two-thirds of
 
06:37:50.330 --> 06:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
the several states have made application
 
06:37:54.350 --> 06:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
on the same subject Mr Speaker as I said
 
06:37:56.390 --> 06:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
last month this body voted
 
06:37:59.270 --> 06:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly to vote down the Article
 
06:37:59.280 --> 06:38:00.250 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly to vote down the Article
5

06:38:00.250 --> 06:38:00.260 align:start position:0%

majority
 
06:38:08.150 --> 06:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
I would ask you to do the same again
 
06:38:08.160 --> 06:38:09.350 align:start position:0%
I would ask you to do the same again
today

06:38:09.350 --> 06:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:38:12.288 --> 06:38:12.298 align:start position:0%
I I know my good friend from Danville
 
06:38:14.628 --> 06:38:14.638 align:start position:0%
will speak to the merits of what he
 
06:38:17.270 --> 06:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
thinks is important about uh limitations
 
06:38:19.490 --> 06:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
of terms
 
06:38:23.030 --> 06:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
but the underlying issue this is an
 
06:38:25.610 --> 06:38:25.620 align:start position:0%
article request an application as the
 
06:38:28.250 --> 06:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
bill says for an article 5 convention
 
06:38:30.288 --> 06:38:30.298 align:start position:0%
and I would ask you to please vote no
 
06:38:32.510 --> 06:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:38:38.990 --> 06:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:41.868 --> 06:38:41.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker distinguished
 
06:38:45.350 --> 06:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
colleagues hcr4 deserves your support an
 
06:38:47.510 --> 06:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention is the people's way
 
06:38:50.270 --> 06:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
to amend the U.S Constitution when a
 
06:38:52.310 --> 06:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
runaway Congress will not do its
 
06:38:54.530 --> 06:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
constitutional Duty historically
 
06:38:56.390 --> 06:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
Congress has refused to heal itself
 
06:38:58.788 --> 06:38:58.798 align:start position:0%
unless and until the people have made
 
06:39:00.770 --> 06:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
their discontent plane by aggregating
 
06:39:02.628 --> 06:39:02.638 align:start position:0%
sufficient support for amending the U.S
 
06:39:02.638 --> 06:39:03.890 align:start position:0%
sufficient support for amending the U.S
Constitution

06:39:03.890 --> 06:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
06:39:05.868 --> 06:39:05.878 align:start position:0%
this is most effectively done by the
 
06:39:07.910 --> 06:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
aggregation of Article 5 petitions from
 
06:39:09.948 --> 06:39:09.958 align:start position:0%
the several States
 
06:39:11.990 --> 06:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
the federal government uses unfunded
 
06:39:13.788 --> 06:39:13.798 align:start position:0%
mandates to effectively control State
 
06:39:15.890 --> 06:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
legislatures local governments and we
 
06:39:17.690 --> 06:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
the people
 
06:39:19.850 --> 06:39:19.860 align:start position:0%
they insert themselves into Americans
 
06:39:22.010 --> 06:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
most personal decisions and they have
 
06:39:24.948 --> 06:39:24.958 align:start position:0%
destroyed a nation's fiscal security New
 
06:39:26.270 --> 06:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a balanced budget
 
06:39:28.010 --> 06:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
amendment petition waiting to be acted
 
06:39:28.020 --> 06:39:29.030 align:start position:0%
amendment petition waiting to be acted
upon

06:39:29.030 --> 06:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
upon
 
06:39:31.250 --> 06:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
let's be honest District of Columbia
 
06:39:34.250 --> 06:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
politicians a more D.C politicians than
 
06:39:36.590 --> 06:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
anything else the chances are extremely
 
06:39:38.510 --> 06:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
high that they'll get it wrong if they
 
06:39:40.010 --> 06:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
get it at all
 
06:39:42.170 --> 06:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
here among the Grassroots is how elected
 
06:39:43.910 --> 06:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
officials in both the states and the
 
06:39:45.770 --> 06:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
federal government can get it right
 
06:39:48.350 --> 06:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
let's think about it would members of
 
06:39:50.330 --> 06:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
Congress really choose to risk losing
 
06:39:51.890 --> 06:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
their seats by ending profligate
 
06:39:54.288 --> 06:39:54.298 align:start position:0%
spending or cutting popular programs
 
06:39:56.628 --> 06:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
when they could just instead raise taxes
 
06:39:58.670 --> 06:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
or issue more unfunded mandates to the
 
06:39:58.680 --> 06:39:59.690 align:start position:0%
or issue more unfunded mandates to the
states

06:39:59.690 --> 06:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
states
 
06:40:01.730 --> 06:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
the people aren't excited by a balanced
 
06:40:03.708 --> 06:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
budget what they want is balanced power
 
06:40:06.770 --> 06:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
they want Congress the president
 
06:40:09.230 --> 06:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
and the courts to do what they were
 
06:40:11.390 --> 06:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
given to do Under the Constitution and
 
06:40:12.830 --> 06:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
they want state and local governments
 
06:40:14.448 --> 06:40:14.458 align:start position:0%
left alone to perform other government
 
06:40:16.970 --> 06:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
functions in response to the needs of
 
06:40:18.830 --> 06:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
their own people
 
06:40:20.930 --> 06:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
sometimes activists are portrayed as
 
06:40:23.090 --> 06:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
extremists but in this case the
 
06:40:25.430 --> 06:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
activists are the voters nothing could
 
06:40:27.170 --> 06:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
be more reasonable than what American
 
06:40:29.330 --> 06:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
people are seeking they are seeking a
 
06:40:31.788 --> 06:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
return to the rule of law Liberty and
 
06:40:31.798 --> 06:40:32.868 align:start position:0%
return to the rule of law Liberty and
Order

06:40:32.868 --> 06:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
Order
 
06:40:35.930 --> 06:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
Democrats Independents and Republicans
 
06:40:38.208 --> 06:40:38.218 align:start position:0%
alike want the three Federal branches of
 
06:40:39.650 --> 06:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
government to be limited to the powers
 
06:40:41.810 --> 06:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
that were that are legitimate for them
 
06:40:44.570 --> 06:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
to exercise under the Constitution if we
 
06:40:47.030 --> 06:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
give them that we take care of a whole
 
06:40:49.250 --> 06:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
host of ancillary problems including the
 
06:40:49.260 --> 06:40:50.208 align:start position:0%
host of ancillary problems including the
budget

06:40:50.208 --> 06:40:50.218 align:start position:0%
budget
 
06:40:52.250 --> 06:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
we must not make the mistake of failing
 
06:40:53.930 --> 06:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
to implement the needed constitutional
 
06:40:55.910 --> 06:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
reforms simply because a different group
 
06:40:57.708 --> 06:40:57.718 align:start position:0%
of politicians will be in charge in the
 
06:40:59.570 --> 06:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
District of Columbia for the next few
 
06:41:02.390 --> 06:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
years precious few politicians will
 
06:41:03.830 --> 06:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
restrain their own power while they are
 
06:41:05.208 --> 06:41:05.218 align:start position:0%
in office
 
06:41:07.190 --> 06:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
even if the administration does choose
 
06:41:09.590 --> 06:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
to exercise self-destrate self-restraint
 
06:41:11.510 --> 06:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
for a few years we cannot afford to
 
06:41:13.010 --> 06:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
leave our Liberty at the whims of
 
06:41:14.750 --> 06:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
individuals by leaving the
 
06:41:16.490 --> 06:41:16.500 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
06:43:10.730 --> 06:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
know that Congress has proposed over 12
 
06:43:12.470 --> 06:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
000 amendments to the Constitution since
 
06:43:15.170 --> 06:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
1789 and yet the states have proposed
 
06:43:17.510 --> 06:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
zero despite both having equal power to
 
06:43:19.610 --> 06:43:19.620 align:start position:0%
do so and if I know that 82 percent of
 
06:43:22.670 --> 06:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
Voters 87 Republican 83 Democrat support
 
06:43:24.830 --> 06:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
term limits for congress showing rare
 
06:43:27.288 --> 06:43:27.298 align:start position:0%
bipartisan agreement and if I know the
 
06:43:28.330 --> 06:43:28.340 align:start position:0%
current system overwhelming
 
06:43:30.650 --> 06:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly protects incumbents with
 
06:43:32.270 --> 06:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
only 20 percent of races being
 
06:43:32.280 --> 06:43:33.470 align:start position:0%
only 20 percent of races being
competitive

06:43:33.470 --> 06:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
06:43:35.750 --> 06:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
and fundraising for their next race
 
06:43:37.368 --> 06:43:37.378 align:start position:0%
becomes the primary focus of these

06:48:25.310 --> 06:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
well what's best for their roads and
 
06:48:27.890 --> 06:48:27.900 align:start position:0%

colleagues
 
06:51:30.110 --> 06:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
so as we were debating this bill and
 
06:51:33.288 --> 06:51:33.298 align:start position:0%
committee some things become had become
 
06:51:36.548 --> 06:51:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:40.250 --> 06:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
198 would require non-resident drivers
 
06:51:42.170 --> 06:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
who establish residency in New Hampshire
 
06:51:44.270 --> 06:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
to notify the New Hampshire Department
 
06:51:47.930 --> 06:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
of Safety if they then choke cease to
 
06:51:50.628 --> 06:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
become residents within 60 days or if
 
06:51:52.490 --> 06:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
they're out of state driver's license
 
06:51:55.610 --> 06:51:55.620 align:start position:0%
expires or is relinquished and then it
 
06:51:56.750 --> 06:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
goes on with a bunch of other
 
06:51:56.760 --> 06:51:58.430 align:start position:0%
goes on with a bunch of other
requirements

06:51:58.430 --> 06:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
06:52:01.250 --> 06:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
which I'm not going to get into because
 
06:52:03.650 --> 06:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
they are
 
06:52:07.070 --> 06:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
overly broad very confusing and
 
06:52:10.070 --> 06:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
difficult to keep track of what may or
 
06:52:13.310 --> 06:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
may not happen I am worried about
 
06:52:16.510 --> 06:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences the DMV
 
06:52:19.670 --> 06:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
testified at the hearing for this bill
 
06:52:23.270 --> 06:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
that they didn't know who would do the
 
06:52:25.968 --> 06:52:25.978 align:start position:0%
Gathering of the information and who
 
06:52:27.530 --> 06:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
would collect it and how it would be
 
06:52:27.540 --> 06:52:28.868 align:start position:0%
would collect it and how it would be
disseminated

06:52:28.868 --> 06:52:28.878 align:start position:0%
disseminated
 
06:52:31.610 --> 06:52:31.620 align:start position:0%
the fact is this bill is not ready for
 
06:52:34.788 --> 06:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
prime time it would be it would be best
 
06:52:34.798 --> 06:52:36.250 align:start position:0%
prime time it would be it would be best
if

06:52:36.250 --> 06:52:36.260 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:52:38.930 --> 06:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
the sponsors took a stab at this at
 
06:52:42.190 --> 06:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
another time so I would urge you to
 
06:52:46.610 --> 06:52:46.620 align:start position:0%
vote no on the
 
06:52:50.930 --> 06:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:57.350 --> 06:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:01.010 --> 06:53:01.020 align:start position:0%

06:53:05.690 --> 06:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
sorry requires new residents of New
 
06:53:07.968 --> 06:53:07.978 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to transfer their out-of-state
 
06:53:10.190 --> 06:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
driver's license to New Hampshire within
 
06:53:11.750 --> 06:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
60 days
 
06:53:14.150 --> 06:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
however we have evidence that it's not
 
06:53:17.628 --> 06:53:17.638 align:start position:0%
being done back in 2017 the Secretary of
 
06:53:19.788 --> 06:53:19.798 align:start position:0%
State and Commissioner of safety
 
06:53:21.890 --> 06:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
compared the voter database from the
 
06:53:25.128 --> 06:53:25.138 align:start position:0%
November 2016 election and the DMV
 
06:53:27.770 --> 06:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
database and issued a joint report
 
06:53:31.090 --> 06:53:31.100 align:start position:0%
stating that 6
 
06:53:34.250 --> 06:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
540 individuals presented an
 
06:53:36.350 --> 06:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
out-of-state driver's license while
 
06:53:39.830 --> 06:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
using same-day registration to vote
 
06:53:42.468 --> 06:53:42.478 align:start position:0%
roughly 10 months later when the records
 
06:53:45.110 --> 06:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
were examined well beyond the 60-day
 
06:53:49.910 --> 06:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
requirement of RSA 263 colon 35
 
06:53:53.930 --> 06:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
only 15 and a half percent had sent
 
06:53:56.208 --> 06:53:56.218 align:start position:0%
received a New Hampshire driver's
 
06:53:56.218 --> 06:53:57.708 align:start position:0%
received a New Hampshire driver's
license

06:53:57.708 --> 06:53:57.718 align:start position:0%
license
 
06:54:02.048 --> 06:54:02.058 align:start position:0%
it is this dismal 84 and a half percent
 
06:54:05.208 --> 06:54:05.218 align:start position:0%
unexplained non-compliance rate
 
06:54:08.390 --> 06:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
that this bill seeks to address
 
06:54:10.730 --> 06:54:10.740 align:start position:0%
this bill attempts to address this issue
 
06:54:13.430 --> 06:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
by doing two things first it authorizes
 
06:54:15.890 --> 06:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
sharing of information on voters who
 
06:54:17.690 --> 06:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
registered with an out-of-state license
 
06:54:21.468 --> 06:54:21.478 align:start position:0%
on an ongoing basis so the DMV can send
 
06:54:24.110 --> 06:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
them reminder notices
 
06:54:27.410 --> 06:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
and second it creates a requirement for
 
06:54:30.048 --> 06:54:30.058 align:start position:0%
individuals who do not plan to transfer
 
06:54:33.890 --> 06:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
their driver's license to explain why to
 
06:54:35.628 --> 06:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
the DMV
 
06:54:38.810 --> 06:54:38.820 align:start position:0%
the 2017 report identified a few
 
06:54:41.690 --> 06:54:41.700 align:start position:0%
legitimate reasons why this could happen
 
06:54:44.570 --> 06:54:44.580 align:start position:0%
such as moving back out of state or an
 
06:54:46.310 --> 06:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
elderly person giving up their driving
 
06:54:49.368 --> 06:54:49.378 align:start position:0%
privileges tracking these situations
 
06:54:52.910 --> 06:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
will permit future reports to be more
 
06:54:52.920 --> 06:54:54.890 align:start position:0%
will permit future reports to be more
accurate

06:54:54.890 --> 06:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
06:54:58.368 --> 06:54:58.378 align:start position:0%
this bill is also in part a follow-up to
 
06:55:03.770 --> 06:55:03.780 align:start position:0%
the 2018 House Bill 1264 which clarified
 
06:55:06.708 --> 06:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
the definitions of domicile and
 
06:55:09.708 --> 06:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
residency in our laws effectively making
 
06:55:11.990 --> 06:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
them the same thing
 
06:55:14.570 --> 06:55:14.580 align:start position:0%
prior to this law one could in certain
 
06:55:17.330 --> 06:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
circumstances be a qualified voter
 
06:55:21.830 --> 06:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
without being subject to RSA 263 colon
 
06:55:21.840 --> 06:55:23.150 align:start position:0%
without being subject to RSA 263 colon
35.

06:55:23.150 --> 06:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
35.
 
06:55:25.610 --> 06:55:25.620 align:start position:0%
this is no longer the case
 
06:55:28.490 --> 06:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
that law has twice been before the New
 
06:55:30.590 --> 06:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court
 
06:55:32.990 --> 06:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
and both times the court has addressed
 
06:55:37.010 --> 06:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
the interaction between it and RSA 263
 
06:55:39.590 --> 06:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
colon 35's requirement to get an
 
06:55:42.110 --> 06:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
in-state driver's license and the court
 
06:55:44.830 --> 06:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
has indicated that there are no
 
06:55:47.090 --> 06:55:47.100 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues
 
06:55:49.548 --> 06:55:49.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and I urge everyone
 
06:55:53.090 --> 06:55:53.100 align:start position:0%

06:55:56.208 --> 06:55:56.218 align:start position:0%
remember yield to a question
 
06:55:58.910 --> 06:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
remember does not yield
 
06:56:01.610 --> 06:56:01.620 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is ought to pass on
 
06:56:05.270 --> 06:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 198. this is a division vote
 
06:56:53.570 --> 06:56:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:55.368 --> 06:56:55.378 align:start position:0%
emotionally Forest is not a pass in
 
06:56:57.530 --> 06:56:57.540 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:57:10.788 --> 06:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that the DMV has no
 
06:57:12.770 --> 06:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
way of knowing who was moved into or out
 
06:57:14.030 --> 06:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
06:57:16.010 --> 06:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
and if I know there is no mechanism for
 
06:57:19.490 --> 06:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
enforcing HB 198 or managing the program
 
06:57:21.048 --> 06:57:21.058 align:start position:0%
and if I know that there are no
 
06:57:22.788 --> 06:57:22.798 align:start position:0%
penalties for failing to comply with
 
06:57:24.110 --> 06:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
this law
 
06:57:25.850 --> 06:57:25.860 align:start position:0%

from past election shows that we have a
 
06:57:41.510 --> 06:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
dismal 15 compliance rate with our
 
06:57:43.190 --> 06:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
requirement for new residents to get an
 
06:57:45.650 --> 06:57:45.660 align:start position:0%

compliance
 
06:57:59.390 --> 06:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
if I also would like to see the DMV
 
06:58:01.850 --> 06:58:01.860 align:start position:0%
track valid excuses so the reports can
 
06:58:04.310 --> 06:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
be more accurate finally Mr Speaker if I
 
06:58:05.810 --> 06:58:05.820 align:start position:0%
know this topic has been addressed twice
 
06:58:07.310 --> 06:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
by the New Hampshire Supreme Court in
 
06:58:08.810 --> 06:58:08.820 align:start position:0%

07:02:51.770 --> 07:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
I would never sponsor a co-sponsor a
 
07:02:53.090 --> 07:02:53.100 align:start position:0%
bill that didn't that I didn't think
 
07:02:56.150 --> 07:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
provided value above and beyond the cost
 
07:02:57.708 --> 07:02:57.718 align:start position:0%
I can't think of anything more valuable
 
07:02:59.810 --> 07:02:59.820 align:start position:0%
than saving lives
 
07:03:01.310 --> 07:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
there is no question that seatbelt to
 
07:03:03.590 --> 07:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
the single best and least expensive way
 
07:03:05.628 --> 07:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
to prevent Serious injury or death and
 
07:03:12.110 --> 07:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:12.120 --> 07:03:16.730 align:start position:0%
 
Yates

07:03:16.730 --> 07:03:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:16.740 --> 07:03:18.288 align:start position:0%
 
nationally

07:03:18.288 --> 07:03:18.298 align:start position:0%
nationally
 
07:03:19.930 --> 07:03:19.940 align:start position:0%
now that's over
 
07:03:22.368 --> 07:03:22.378 align:start position:0%
90.4 percent of Motor Vehicle occupants
 
07:03:24.770 --> 07:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
buckle up yet more than 50 percent of
 
07:03:27.530 --> 07:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
the deaths occur within that 9.6 percent
 
07:03:29.868 --> 07:03:29.878 align:start position:0%
who are unrestrained
 
07:03:32.990 --> 07:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire only 75 percent
 
07:03:35.330 --> 07:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
of vehicle occupants buckle up and
 
07:03:37.070 --> 07:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
accordingly two-thirds of the deaths
 
07:03:38.510 --> 07:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
that occur in New Hampshire are to
 
07:03:43.850 --> 07:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:45.530 --> 07:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
restrained motor vehicle occupants are
 
07:03:47.570 --> 07:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
50 percent less likely to die in a crash
 
07:03:49.730 --> 07:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
and sixty percent less likely to sustain
 
07:03:51.708 --> 07:03:51.718 align:start position:0%
serious or potentially life-altering
 
07:03:51.718 --> 07:03:52.910 align:start position:0%
serious or potentially life-altering
injuries

07:03:52.910 --> 07:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
injuries
 
07:03:54.770 --> 07:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
but none of these statistics matter if
 
07:03:56.270 --> 07:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
we believe that failing to wear a seat
 
07:03:58.610 --> 07:03:58.620 align:start position:0%
belt is only a risk to the unrestrained
 
07:03:58.620 --> 07:03:59.570 align:start position:0%
belt is only a risk to the unrestrained
person

07:03:59.570 --> 07:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
person
 
07:04:01.670 --> 07:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
but we know that's not the case anything
 
07:04:03.288 --> 07:04:03.298 align:start position:0%
that is not secured in a vehicle will
 
07:04:05.030 --> 07:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
become a dangerous projectile in a crash
 
07:04:07.670 --> 07:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
including a human body
 
07:04:09.890 --> 07:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
a person weighing 150 pounds will strike
 
07:04:11.868 --> 07:04:11.878 align:start position:0%
another occupant with the force of 4 500
 
07:04:11.878 --> 07:04:12.890 align:start position:0%

pounds
 
07:04:15.170 --> 07:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
in a collision of 30 miles per hour
 
07:04:16.850 --> 07:04:16.860 align:start position:0%
imagine how much damage you could do to
 
07:04:18.110 --> 07:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
a child
 
07:04:19.968 --> 07:04:19.978 align:start position:0%
or other loved one if you simply fell on
 
07:04:22.010 --> 07:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
them now imagine falling on them at 30
 
07:04:24.230 --> 07:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
miles per hour or more
 
07:04:26.208 --> 07:04:26.218 align:start position:0%
seat belts prevent secondary crashes by
 
07:04:27.468 --> 07:04:27.478 align:start position:0%
ensuring the driver can continue to
 
07:04:29.150 --> 07:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
control the vehicle the driver who
 
07:04:30.708 --> 07:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
sustains a serious leg injury which is
 
07:04:32.990 --> 07:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
very common to under strange drivers as
 
07:04:34.910 --> 07:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
they slide under the dash cannot apply
 
07:04:36.288 --> 07:04:36.298 align:start position:0%
the brake to prevent the vehicle from
 
07:04:38.090 --> 07:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
rolling into traffic going to a busy
 
07:04:38.100 --> 07:04:39.830 align:start position:0%

intersection

07:04:39.830 --> 07:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
intersection
 
07:04:41.510 --> 07:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
a driver that is displaced from the
 
07:04:43.128 --> 07:04:43.138 align:start position:0%
passenger seat cannot steer a vehicle
 
07:04:44.570 --> 07:04:44.580 align:start position:0%
out of the traffic lane
 
07:04:45.910 --> 07:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
and most disturbingly understand
 
07:04:48.530 --> 07:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
unrestrained occupants are ejected from
 
07:04:49.968 --> 07:04:49.978 align:start position:0%
a vehicle almost a third of the time
 
07:04:51.770 --> 07:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
often becoming just another piece of
 
07:04:53.628 --> 07:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
road debris that other drivers must
 
07:04:53.638 --> 07:04:54.770 align:start position:0%
road debris that other drivers must
avoid

07:04:54.770 --> 07:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
avoid
 
07:04:56.510 --> 07:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
not wearing a seat belt increases the
 
07:04:58.250 --> 07:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
risk of severe injury putting stress on
 
07:04:59.448 --> 07:04:59.458 align:start position:0%
the availability
 
07:05:01.190 --> 07:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
on the ability of First Responders and
 
07:05:02.930 --> 07:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
medical professionals to provide
 
07:05:05.750 --> 07:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
adequate care to everyone those who are
 
07:05:07.368 --> 07:05:07.378 align:start position:0%
the sickest of the or the most seriously
 
07:05:09.590 --> 07:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
injured receive care first imagine being
 
07:05:10.910 --> 07:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
injured because you weren't wearing a
 
07:05:12.948 --> 07:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
seat belt and knowing that someone died
 
07:05:15.048 --> 07:05:15.058 align:start position:0%
because the med flight helicopter was
 
07:05:17.270 --> 07:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
diverted to fly you to the trauma center
 
07:05:18.650 --> 07:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
without the heart attack victim who
 
07:05:21.830 --> 07:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
arrived at the ER at the same time
 
07:05:23.690 --> 07:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
didn't make it because the medical team
 
07:05:25.010 --> 07:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
was preoccupied with getting you
 
07:05:25.020 --> 07:05:26.750 align:start position:0%
was preoccupied with getting you
stabilized

07:05:26.750 --> 07:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
stabilized
 
07:05:28.190 --> 07:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is about freedom but it's
 
07:05:30.650 --> 07:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
also about personal responsibility
 
07:05:32.208 --> 07:05:32.218 align:start position:0%
so many states and countries around the
 
07:05:33.770 --> 07:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
world have seatbelt laws because they
 
07:05:33.780 --> 07:05:34.788 align:start position:0%
world have seatbelt laws because they
work

07:05:34.788 --> 07:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
work
 
07:05:36.170 --> 07:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
It is Well understood that getting
 
07:05:37.850 --> 07:05:37.860 align:start position:0%
people to buckle up is a three-legged
 
07:05:39.708 --> 07:05:39.718 align:start position:0%
stool of Education engineering and
 
07:05:41.868 --> 07:05:41.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement no matter what other safety
 
07:05:44.208 --> 07:05:44.218 align:start position:0%
features a car has they cannot match a
 
07:05:47.230 --> 07:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
Simplicity and efficacy of seat belts
 
07:05:49.490 --> 07:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
it has been proven that marketing and
 
07:05:51.288 --> 07:05:51.298 align:start position:0%
education alone cannot persuade people
 
07:05:52.610 --> 07:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
to wear seat belts no matter how
 
07:05:54.770 --> 07:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
convincing the statistics or gruesome
 
07:05:55.850 --> 07:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
the injuries
 
07:05:57.350 --> 07:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
this law is Taylor Made for New
 
07:05:57.360 --> 07:05:58.788 align:start position:0%
this law is Taylor Made for New
Hampshire

07:05:58.788 --> 07:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
07:06:00.650 --> 07:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
just to be clear it is a secondary law
 
07:06:02.628 --> 07:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
meaning you cannot be pulled over simply
 
07:06:04.610 --> 07:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
for not wearing a seatbelt
 
07:06:06.830 --> 07:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
the fine is extremely low
 
07:06:08.390 --> 07:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
and there's a Litany of Common Sense
 
07:06:11.330 --> 07:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
exceptions to the law HP 222 is simply
 
07:06:13.490 --> 07:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
the Third Leg of the stool it sends a
 
07:06:14.990 --> 07:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
message that wearing a seat belt is
 
07:06:17.330 --> 07:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
still a choice but helps emphasize of
 
07:06:21.288 --> 07:06:21.298 align:start position:0%
buckling up is simply common sense
 
07:06:23.990 --> 07:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker request a
 
07:06:27.288 --> 07:06:27.298 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:32.750 --> 07:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:48.110 --> 07:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:51.048 --> 07:06:51.058 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and colleagues I'm
 
07:06:52.788 --> 07:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
going to take a slightly different tact
 
07:06:54.288 --> 07:06:54.298 align:start position:0%
on this
 
07:06:57.170 --> 07:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
I want you to think about an 18 year old
 
07:06:59.570 --> 07:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
hitchhiking cross country
 
07:07:01.548 --> 07:07:01.558 align:start position:0%
picked up
 
07:07:04.670 --> 07:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly given a ride down the
 
07:07:10.548 --> 07:07:10.558 align:start position:0%
road and that car crashes and rolls over
 
07:07:12.770 --> 07:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
neither the driver nor the passenger
 
07:07:15.350 --> 07:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
were wearing a seat belt
 
07:07:17.208 --> 07:07:17.218 align:start position:0%
the driver
 
07:07:19.310 --> 07:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
did not survive
 
07:07:21.468 --> 07:07:21.478 align:start position:0%
the crash
 
07:07:24.468 --> 07:07:24.478 align:start position:0%
the passenger survived the crash
 
07:07:29.750 --> 07:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:35.090 --> 07:07:35.100 align:start position:0%
in this course of time that passenger
 
07:07:38.090 --> 07:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
got Addicted by his doctor
 
07:07:41.570 --> 07:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
to drug painkillers because of the the
 
07:07:45.350 --> 07:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
back the broken back that he was gotten
 
07:07:47.448 --> 07:07:47.458 align:start position:0%
that person
 
07:07:50.390 --> 07:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
by the way was my brother
 
07:07:53.868 --> 07:07:53.878 align:start position:0%
and he went on to have a lifetime of
 
07:07:53.878 --> 07:07:55.128 align:start position:0%
and he went on to have a lifetime of
pain

07:07:55.128 --> 07:07:55.138 align:start position:0%
pain
 
07:07:57.910 --> 07:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
and disappointment and difficulties
 
07:08:01.730 --> 07:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
until at the age of 50 he passed away
 
07:08:05.150 --> 07:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
leaving a a wife and two teenage
 
07:08:05.160 --> 07:08:06.590 align:start position:0%
leaving a a wife and two teenage
children

07:08:06.590 --> 07:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
children
 
07:08:09.670 --> 07:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
I bring this to your attention because
 
07:08:12.948 --> 07:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
it's high time that we recognize that
 
07:08:16.910 --> 07:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
the myth that only the person not
 
07:08:19.010 --> 07:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
wearing the seat belt is the person who
 
07:08:22.250 --> 07:08:22.260 align:start position:0%
gets hurt or killed or whatever and it's
 
07:08:23.570 --> 07:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
a myth
 
07:08:27.410 --> 07:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
family suffer other people suffer and we
 
07:08:29.390 --> 07:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to try and alleviate
 
07:08:32.270 --> 07:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
that if we can
 
07:08:36.170 --> 07:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
I would also ask my colleagues
 
07:08:38.208 --> 07:08:38.218 align:start position:0%
colleagues who I've been in the fire
 
07:08:41.110 --> 07:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
service like I have or was for 28 years
 
07:08:44.330 --> 07:08:44.340 align:start position:0%
colleagues who are police officers
 
07:08:46.850 --> 07:08:46.860 align:start position:0%
those of us who have been
 
07:08:49.968 --> 07:08:49.978 align:start position:0%
responding to crashes and have seen some
 
07:08:53.510 --> 07:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
pretty difficult things
 
07:08:55.490 --> 07:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
and I would urge you to look inside
 
07:08:58.490 --> 07:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
yourself and think about what is the
 
07:09:01.010 --> 07:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
best thing for the people of New
 
07:09:03.410 --> 07:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire never mind the politics of it
 
07:09:06.110 --> 07:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
what is the best thing for those people
 
07:09:09.110 --> 07:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
based on your experiences and I would
 
07:09:11.448 --> 07:09:11.458 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote
 
07:09:14.330 --> 07:09:14.340 align:start position:0%
against the itl so another motion could
 
07:09:16.850 --> 07:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
be introduced
 
07:09:24.410 --> 07:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:26.990 --> 07:09:27.000 align:start position:0%

but let's not kid ourselves
 
07:10:11.270 --> 07:10:11.280 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:12:11.990 --> 07:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that total motor
 
07:12:14.090 --> 07:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
vehicle crashes have continued to climb
 
07:12:16.490 --> 07:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire year to year and the
 
07:12:18.288 --> 07:12:18.298 align:start position:0%
average inpatient costs for unbelted
 
07:12:20.690 --> 07:12:20.700 align:start position:0%
crash victims is 55 percent higher than
 
07:12:22.788 --> 07:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
belted crash victims
 
07:12:24.650 --> 07:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
and if I know that New Hampshire is the
 
07:12:25.968 --> 07:12:25.978 align:start position:0%
only state in the country without an
 
07:12:28.730 --> 07:12:28.740 align:start position:0%
adult safety belt law has the lowest
 
07:12:31.010 --> 07:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
seat belt use rate if nearly 10 to 20
 
07:12:33.410 --> 07:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
percent lower than every other state
 
07:12:35.690 --> 07:12:35.700 align:start position:0%
and the highest unbelted fatality rate
 
07:12:37.190 --> 07:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
in the country
 
07:12:38.810 --> 07:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill would be
 
07:12:40.850 --> 07:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
enforceable only as a secondary offense
 
07:12:43.010 --> 07:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
meaning that a driver may not be stopped
 
07:12:44.510 --> 07:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
by police for failure to wear a seat
 
07:12:46.128 --> 07:12:46.138 align:start position:0%
belt alone
 
07:12:49.250 --> 07:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
and if I know that passing HB 222fn
 
07:12:50.930 --> 07:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
would increase safety belt usage
 
07:12:54.350 --> 07:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
decrease injuries lower costs and save
 
07:12:57.230 --> 07:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
lives would I now vote no and push the
 
07:12:58.968 --> 07:12:58.978 align:start position:0%
red button so that another motion may be
 
07:13:01.490 --> 07:13:01.500 align:start position:0%

mandatory seat belt law states and I
 
07:13:22.788 --> 07:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
know that if wearing your seat belt is
 
07:13:25.190 --> 07:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
as smart and safe thing to do but I also
 
07:13:26.868 --> 07:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
know that this is New Hampshire and we
 
07:13:28.730 --> 07:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
are the Live Free or Die State and we
 
07:13:29.990 --> 07:13:30.000 align:start position:0%

don't know Mulligan is a do-over yeah
 
07:20:16.490 --> 07:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
and if you don't know what Mulligans are
 
07:20:18.890 --> 07:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
it's extra shots you can buy they have
 
07:20:20.750 --> 07:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
to pay money for that and sometimes to
 
07:20:22.610 --> 07:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
make money The Mulligans cost money but
 
07:20:25.368 --> 07:20:25.378 align:start position:0%

07:20:45.048 --> 07:20:45.058 align:start position:0%
the dumb sitting from the blue tees but
 
07:20:47.270 --> 07:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
if you want Equity then the white tees
 
07:20:50.270 --> 07:20:50.280 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:22:52.490 --> 07:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
there's this meme online that takes many
 
07:22:54.650 --> 07:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
different forms but the basic setup is
 
07:22:56.868 --> 07:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
you see a picture from years back
 
07:22:59.628 --> 07:22:59.638 align:start position:0%
in a picture from now and the title says
 
07:23:01.128 --> 07:23:01.138 align:start position:0%
something along the lines of feel old
 
07:23:01.138 --> 07:23:02.090 align:start position:0%
something along the lines of feel old
yet

07:23:02.090 --> 07:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
yet
 
07:23:03.770 --> 07:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
and today I would like to share with the
 
07:23:06.048 --> 07:23:06.058 align:start position:0%
house some phrases that will likely have
 
07:23:08.570 --> 07:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
the same effect on you as they do on me
 
07:23:10.250 --> 07:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
whenever I hear them
 
07:23:13.548 --> 07:23:13.558 align:start position:0%

next week March 19th and 20th

marks the 20th anniversary of the
 
07:23:25.850 --> 07:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
beginning of the war in Iraq
 
07:23:28.070 --> 07:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
I remember clearly being seven years old
 
07:23:30.110 --> 07:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
and watching President Bush on
 
07:23:32.930 --> 07:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
television give Saddam Hussein in Uday
 
07:23:37.070 --> 07:23:37.080 align:start position:0%

shaped in many of our formative years
 
07:23:44.090 --> 07:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
whether it was being picked up from
 
07:23:45.650 --> 07:23:45.660 align:start position:0%

07:23:48.110 --> 07:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
we're hearing your president on
 
07:23:50.030 --> 07:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
television every day there was an evil
 
07:23:52.190 --> 07:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
doer somewhere with wmd who needed to be
 
07:23:53.868 --> 07:23:53.878 align:start position:0%
dealt with
 
07:23:55.850 --> 07:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
having grown up in that time I know full
 
07:23:58.190 --> 07:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
well that that conflict is a divisive
 
07:24:00.708 --> 07:24:00.718 align:start position:0%
topic and I want to avoid that for today
 
07:24:02.650 --> 07:24:02.660 align:start position:0%
because the fact of the matter is
 
07:24:05.030 --> 07:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
4491 American Service members lost their
 
07:24:06.890 --> 07:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
lives in Iraq as well as hundreds of
 
07:24:08.628 --> 07:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
thousands of Iraqis
 
07:24:10.368 --> 07:24:10.378 align:start position:0%
and I would ask for something a little
 
07:24:12.708 --> 07:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
unorthodox and ask you all to stand with
 
07:24:15.170 --> 07:24:15.180 align:start position:0%

two years to the day eight people died

across three spas in Atlanta

violence against Asians and Asian
 
07:27:37.128 --> 07:27:37.138 align:start position:0%
Americans had both preceded and followed
 
07:27:39.048 --> 07:27:39.058 align:start position:0%
that day but it marked an important time
 
07:27:40.070 --> 07:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
in history
 
07:27:41.930 --> 07:27:41.940 align:start position:0%
because it appeared that the country was
 
07:27:43.968 --> 07:27:43.978 align:start position:0%
finally acknowledging would have been so
 
07:27:45.830 --> 07:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
clear to Asian Americans from Washington

State to Washington D.C
 
07:27:51.350 --> 07:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire our small
 
07:27:52.868 --> 07:27:52.878 align:start position:0%
constellation of Asian communities
 
07:27:55.190 --> 07:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
rallied in support of the victims and
 
07:27:56.868 --> 07:27:56.878 align:start position:0%
their families days later
 
07:27:58.670 --> 07:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
not because we make up a large portion
 
07:28:00.288 --> 07:28:00.298 align:start position:0%
of the state's population
 
07:28:02.510 --> 07:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
but because we don't
 
07:28:04.310 --> 07:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
we knew that so many would rather suffer
 
07:28:07.368 --> 07:28:07.378 align:start position:0%
in silence than share their pain
 
07:28:09.170 --> 07:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
a difficult truth is that there are no
 
07:28:11.690 --> 07:28:11.700 align:start position:0%
impediments to how far hate can reach no
 
07:28:14.270 --> 07:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
barriers to the feeling of loss no walls
 
07:28:15.770 --> 07:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
to Shield us from grief
 
07:28:17.270 --> 07:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
but the same can be said about love
 
07:28:19.548 --> 07:28:19.558 align:start position:0%
compassion and empathy
 
07:28:21.230 --> 07:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
just for that reason that I stand before
 
07:28:23.810 --> 07:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
you today to commemorate those lives
 
07:28:25.910 --> 07:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
lost in a city a thousand miles from
 
07:28:25.920 --> 07:28:27.048 align:start position:0%

07:28:28.670 --> 07:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
I don't know if any remarks are made to
 
07:28:31.310 --> 07:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
this legislative body back in 2021 but
 
07:28:33.350 --> 07:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that now is my colleagues he
 
07:28:34.730 --> 07:28:34.740 align:start position:0%
will join me in a moment of silence for
 
07:28:57.730 --> 07:28:57.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:01.190 --> 07:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
always remember rise Mr Speaker I move
 
07:29:02.750 --> 07:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
that the remarks be placed in the
 
07:29:04.968 --> 07:29:04.978 align:start position:0%
permanent journal what other objection
 
07:29:09.770 --> 07:29:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:09.780 --> 07:29:21.788 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

07:29:21.788 --> 07:29:21.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:24.590 --> 07:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
because this is the side most deserving
 
07:29:27.468 --> 07:29:27.478 align:start position:0%
and in need of my apology
 
07:29:29.750 --> 07:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
three weeks ago went through a series of
 
07:29:31.190 --> 07:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
motions that appeared that we were about
 
07:29:33.410 --> 07:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
to reverse the fate of a bill and the
 
07:29:35.208 --> 07:29:35.218 align:start position:0%
acting speaker unexpectedly called to
 
07:29:37.310 --> 07:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
recess ostensibly in order to affect the
 
07:29:40.070 --> 07:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
outcome amongst much consternation in
 
07:29:42.708 --> 07:29:42.718 align:start position:0%
the chamber I expressed my displeasure
 
07:29:45.468 --> 07:29:45.478 align:start position:0%
by loudly exclaiming a profanity
 
07:29:47.690 --> 07:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
that was disrespectful
 
07:29:49.670 --> 07:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
and not rising to the standard I would
 
07:29:51.350 --> 07:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
hope for this body
 
07:29:53.810 --> 07:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
despite my personal fondness of colorful
 
07:29:56.868 --> 07:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
language I do believe in Civility and
 
07:29:59.570 --> 07:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
therefore I genuinely apologize for my
 
07:30:01.368 --> 07:30:01.378 align:start position:0%
language and lack of Civility on that
 
07:30:01.378 --> 07:30:02.930 align:start position:0%
language and lack of Civility on that
day

07:30:02.930 --> 07:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
day
 
07:30:04.788 --> 07:30:04.798 align:start position:0%
this has been an interesting learning
 
07:30:07.368 --> 07:30:07.378 align:start position:0%
moment for me because I had only just
 
07:30:09.830 --> 07:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
the previous week testified in two
 
07:30:12.410 --> 07:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
separate committees on this very topic
 
07:30:14.390 --> 07:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
the issue of Civility and good
 
07:30:14.400 --> 07:30:15.468 align:start position:0%
the issue of Civility and good
governance

07:30:15.468 --> 07:30:15.478 align:start position:0%
governance
 
07:30:17.208 --> 07:30:17.218 align:start position:0%
and if you would humor me I would like
 
07:30:18.890 --> 07:30:18.900 align:start position:0%
to invite you into that learning moment
 
07:30:20.030 --> 07:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
with me
 
07:30:21.948 --> 07:30:21.958 align:start position:0%
in both of these committees I spoke
 
07:30:23.948 --> 07:30:23.958 align:start position:0%
about the importance of small D
 
07:30:27.110 --> 07:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
Democratic consensus to good governance
 
07:30:29.208 --> 07:30:29.218 align:start position:0%
the idea that we all agree to the same
 
07:30:31.670 --> 07:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
set of rules and so we are okay even
 
07:30:33.468 --> 07:30:33.478 align:start position:0%
with outcomes that we don't like because
 
07:30:36.230 --> 07:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
we believe that those rules are fair we
 
07:30:38.330 --> 07:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
bemoan how divided and polarized and
 
07:30:40.368 --> 07:30:40.378 align:start position:0%
uncivil we have become
 
07:30:42.288 --> 07:30:42.298 align:start position:0%
but that polarization is not actually
 
07:30:44.868 --> 07:30:44.878 align:start position:0%
because we disagree on things like taxes
 
07:30:48.048 --> 07:30:48.058 align:start position:0%
and abortion and guns it's because we
 
07:30:50.750 --> 07:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
don't trust each other to not cheat
 
07:30:52.670 --> 07:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
because as long as people believe that
 
07:30:55.070 --> 07:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
the process is fair people tend to
 
07:30:56.628 --> 07:30:56.638 align:start position:0%
accept outcomes
 
07:30:58.430 --> 07:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
but it turns out that when we stop
 
07:31:01.430 --> 07:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
engaging in good faith civility becomes
 
07:31:01.440 --> 07:31:02.810 align:start position:0%
engaging in good faith civility becomes
forfeit

07:31:02.810 --> 07:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
forfeit
 
07:31:04.788 --> 07:31:04.798 align:start position:0%
the problem is that we do not trust each
 
07:31:06.410 --> 07:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
other in this room
 
07:31:08.570 --> 07:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
and worse we have every reason to not
 
07:31:10.250 --> 07:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
trust each other
 
07:31:12.530 --> 07:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
more than anything in my six plus years
 
07:31:16.490 --> 07:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
in this chamber I have been apoplectic
 
07:31:20.090 --> 07:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
at the games we play all both sides
 
07:31:22.490 --> 07:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
bills die not because they are bad bills
 
07:31:24.110 --> 07:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
but because of what party or what
 
07:31:26.690 --> 07:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
personality sponsors them and we use
 
07:31:29.150 --> 07:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
insincere arguments to do so
 
07:31:31.368 --> 07:31:31.378 align:start position:0%
we spend our time strategizing on how to
 
07:31:33.048 --> 07:31:33.058 align:start position:0%
make the other party look bad rather
 
07:31:34.788 --> 07:31:34.798 align:start position:0%
than working to find good language to
 
07:31:37.310 --> 07:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
solve problems we're more concerned on
 
07:31:40.310 --> 07:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
how to ingratiate ourselves with chairs
 
07:31:42.530 --> 07:31:42.540 align:start position:0%
or party leaders and angling for
 
07:31:44.208 --> 07:31:44.218 align:start position:0%
leadership positions or how to score
 
07:31:45.948 --> 07:31:45.958 align:start position:0%
points on our opponents whenever someone
 
07:31:48.048 --> 07:31:48.058 align:start position:0%
experiences a personal failure in their
 
07:31:48.058 --> 07:31:49.128 align:start position:0%
experiences a personal failure in their
lives

07:31:49.128 --> 07:31:49.138 align:start position:0%
lives
 
07:31:50.990 --> 07:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
but we look the other way when one of
 
07:31:52.490 --> 07:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
our own team engages in unethical
 
07:31:52.500 --> 07:31:53.810 align:start position:0%
our own team engages in unethical
Behavior

07:31:53.810 --> 07:31:53.820 align:start position:0%
Behavior
 
07:31:55.788 --> 07:31:55.798 align:start position:0%
we come up with titles to make us feel
 
07:31:58.310 --> 07:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
Superior and then we fight over who gets
 
07:32:00.530 --> 07:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
those titles and use those titles as
 
07:32:03.310 --> 07:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
leverage over others we twist rules
 
07:32:05.570 --> 07:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
designed to uphold the will of the
 
07:32:07.010 --> 07:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
majority while protecting the rights of
 
07:32:09.350 --> 07:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
minority in order to subvert those very
 
07:32:11.810 --> 07:32:11.820 align:start position:0%
Concepts we find ways to suppress
 
07:32:14.090 --> 07:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
testimony or suppress reports or
 
07:32:16.190 --> 07:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
schedule hearings or execs strategically
 
07:32:18.590 --> 07:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
or structure activity on session days
 
07:32:19.968 --> 07:32:19.978 align:start position:0%
all to win
 
07:32:23.030 --> 07:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
to win no matter what no matter the
 
07:32:24.410 --> 07:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
principles of fairness we have to
 
07:32:27.170 --> 07:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
sacrifice on the altar of winning
 
07:32:29.868 --> 07:32:29.878 align:start position:0%
this is why the people hate their
 
07:32:29.878 --> 07:32:30.890 align:start position:0%
this is why the people hate their
government

07:32:30.890 --> 07:32:30.900 align:start position:0%
government
 
07:32:33.288 --> 07:32:33.298 align:start position:0%
and the thing is I'm not telling any of
 
07:32:35.270 --> 07:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
you what you don't already know or even
 
07:32:37.788 --> 07:32:37.798 align:start position:0%
what the entire State doesn't know the
 
07:32:39.948 --> 07:32:39.958 align:start position:0%
emperor wears no clothes
 
07:32:42.230 --> 07:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
civility is good
 
07:32:44.990 --> 07:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
but civility alone is meaningless
 
07:32:47.030 --> 07:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
it is not enough to curtsy to each other
 
07:32:48.770 --> 07:32:48.780 align:start position:0%
while we burn down principles of good
 
07:32:48.780 --> 07:32:50.150 align:start position:0%
while we burn down principles of good
governance

07:32:50.150 --> 07:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
governance
 
07:32:52.730 --> 07:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
civility must be backed with good faith
 
07:32:56.750 --> 07:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
engagement so I can and I truly do
 
07:32:58.788 --> 07:32:58.798 align:start position:0%
sincerely apologize for my lack of
 
07:32:58.798 --> 07:32:59.810 align:start position:0%
sincerely apologize for my lack of
Civility

07:32:59.810 --> 07:32:59.820 align:start position:0%
Civility
 
07:33:02.628 --> 07:33:02.638 align:start position:0%
and I hope one day we will all be sorry
 
07:33:05.030 --> 07:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
whenever we see these games played
 
07:33:06.530 --> 07:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
in the rules of good governance
 
07:33:08.510 --> 07:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
perverted because I know the people of
 
07:33:12.410 --> 07:33:12.420 align:start position:0%

moved at the remarks of the previous
 
07:33:34.548 --> 07:33:34.558 align:start position:0%
speaker we put in the permanent Journal

07:34:11.390 --> 07:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:34:14.868 --> 07:34:14.878 align:start position:0%
thus scheduling crossover day on the
 
07:34:18.170 --> 07:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
first day of a major Jewish holiday is
 
07:34:21.350 --> 07:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and fundamentally wrong
 
07:34:24.128 --> 07:34:24.138 align:start position:0%

07:34:26.448 --> 07:34:26.458 align:start position:0%
understanding that there are deadlines
 
07:34:28.788 --> 07:34:28.798 align:start position:0%

house to make that change so that the
 
07:34:36.830 --> 07:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
house can demonstrate its resolve
 
07:34:39.530 --> 07:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
to serve all of our diverse communities
 
07:34:43.730 --> 07:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
