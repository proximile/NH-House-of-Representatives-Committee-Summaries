um reopening the work session on HB
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
1351 prohibiting the sale and use of
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
adhesive based rodent traps uh and let's
 
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
just do a um budget of Al Allegiance
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
before we get started
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh would you like
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
to to the flag of the United States of
 
00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:28.519 align:start position:0%
America and to the Republic for which it
 
00:16:28.519 --> 00:16:29.509 align:start position:0%
America and to the Republic for which it
stands

00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
stands
 
00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759 align:start position:0%
one nation under God indivisible with
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
All so uh I'm just going to present a
 
00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
brief summary here of um I think well I
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
we pretty much know what the bill is
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
about but um when we uh had our hearing
 
00:16:56.189 --> 00:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
on it uh we decided that we are going to
 
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
um send it to interim study because
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
um we heard a fair amount of testim
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
testimony indicating that it was a real
 
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
problem but we also heard testimony
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the uh solution that the
 
00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
bill proposed was not uh workable as it
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
stood uh so interim study the interim
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
study is to uh essentially figure out if
 
00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:24.919 align:start position:0%
there is a um a more workable solution
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
and then uh decide if we want to
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
recommend that solution for uh for the
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
legislation uh and the procedure is that
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
um so we'll have our discussion today in
 
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
committee uh and we'll probably be able
 
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
to uh be at a point at the end of the
 
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
work session today where we can vote as
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
a sub committee to say we will um we
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
recommend or don't recommend further
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
legislation and then that recommendation
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
will go to the full committee and when
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
the full committee work meets to uh
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
to vote on all of our interm study bills
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
then that
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
um that recommendation will be um
 
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
brought forward at that at that full
 
00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.630 align:start position:0%
brought forward at that at that full
committee

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
meeting so just as a um a point to
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
consider as I understand uh the
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
something like glue traps are not under
 
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
the perview of the pesticide review
 
00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799 align:start position:0%
board in the state because it's a
 
00:18:27.799 --> 00:18:31.350 align:start position:0%
board in the state because it's a
non-chemical

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh um solution to dealing with rodents
 
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
is that correct I believe that's correct
 
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
you so um this representative Duty was
 
00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
not able to make it today because she
 
00:18:54.149 --> 00:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
had to um take her husband to medical
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
appointments uh but she did uh suggest
 
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
one one possibility would be uh having
 
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
or requiring some language on the trap
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
on the traps at the point of sale which
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
would uh say one or two of the following
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
things um warning glue traps are known
 
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
to in trap and kill unintended wildlife
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
and pets use of this project product May
 
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
incur legal liabilities or warning glue
 
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
traps are considered inhumane and are
 
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
known to entrap and kill unintended
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
wildlife and pets use of this product
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
May incur legal liabilities so uh one
 
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
one approach would be simply requiring
 
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
that labeling at the point of sale I
 
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
don't know what the mechanics of that
 
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.789 align:start position:0%
don't know what the mechanics of that
would

00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
be thank you
 
00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.310 align:start position:0%
be thank you
um

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.789 --> 00:19:51.799 align:start position:0%
so because of
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
past issues that have been brought
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
before our committee with labeling we
 
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
know that requiring any labeling on any
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
product will essentially prohibit that
 
00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
product from the state of New Hampshire
 
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
um because we are just a
 
00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.549 align:start position:0%
um because we are just a
minute

00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
minute
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
um buyer in right in the scheme of
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
things so I I think by requiring that I
 
00:20:17.789 --> 00:20:17.799 align:start position:0%
mean we went through this with the GMO
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
labeling and everything else and we had
 
00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
discussed that those products would just
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
no longer be sold in New Hampshire and
 
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
that's why that was not a viable option
 
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
and so to do that you would be
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the sale of uh glue traps in
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I don't believe that
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
labeling requiring labeling in the state
 
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:42.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
option um that's a that's a good point
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
that you bring up but I was I remember
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
that you had brought in uh packaging and
 
00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
it had already stated on the label that
 
00:20:59.230 --> 00:20:59.240 align:start position:0%
this product should not be used Outdoors
 
00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
and that was the primary reason was
 
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
because they didn't want the
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
manufacturer did not want um an intended
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
non-targeted uh animals or or reptiles
 
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:13.640 align:start position:0%
or whatever insects or whatever to be
 
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
caught in these glue traps I believe
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
that there was labeling on these
 
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.310 align:start position:0%
that there was labeling on these
products

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
already I don't believe it prohibited it
 
00:21:27.149 --> 00:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
from being outdoors but it was very
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
specific as to where they should be
 
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
placed um because if you prohibit it
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
from being outdoors then you prohibit it
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
from barnyards from the barn um so you
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
know I believe that it should be I think
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's more specific like an enclosed area
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
not just outdoors and and as we heard
 
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
testimony nobody is going to place it
 
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
outside because the dirt's going to get
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
on there and it's going to make the glue
 
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
the adhesive ineffective I mean anything
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
gets on there it becomes ineffective as
 
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
as a means to trap the road
 
00:22:03.269 --> 00:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
in representative
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
Haskins yes good morning well I don't
 
00:22:09.149 --> 00:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
think that labeling is going to work so
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why I'm not going to
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
be supportive of that I'm working on a
 
00:22:18.029 --> 00:22:18.039 align:start position:0%
bill about that has to do with alcohol
 
00:22:22.029 --> 00:22:22.039 align:start position:0%
use disorder and um as a co-sponsor of
 
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
the bill we wanted something to go home
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
with each purchase of alcohol that
 
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
didn't fly so what we got was a video
 
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
message in all the liquor stores I've
 
00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
not talked to anyone that's ever seen
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
who's gone into the liquor store the
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
video message um so yeah I mean I I'll
 
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
say more about what I think we should be
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
doing but I don't think labeling is
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
effective so um okay
 
00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
mommy thanks um I also think that
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
um representative Duty added the part
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
about uh liability that that was that
 
00:23:06.669 --> 00:23:06.679 align:start position:0%
was not would not have been implied or
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
included in the labels or the
 
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
descriptions of use that we saw on the
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
labels that you brought on the products
 
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
that you brought in and um I think that
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
that that that would certainly send a
 
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
usage thein thank you but the problem
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
with that is the enforcement right um um
 
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
we'd all like to think that liability
 
00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:35.799 align:start position:0%
matters to producers and consumers as
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
well but if there's not sufficient
 
00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:42.039 align:start position:0%
enforcement it just is
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
empty and and I'll add a comment here
 
00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
which is that
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
um the uh we know that in the realm of
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
that for uh licensed PES pest uh
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
applicators the label is the law uh and
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
in fact that is also the case for
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
consumers but most consumers don't
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
realize that the label is the law and
 
00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
there are many consumers who are not
 
00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
particularly good about reading the
 
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
labels so uh I'm I'm I think that is
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
another uh another aspect of you know
 
00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
making labeling not necessarily as
 
00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
effective as as as it might be so um but
 
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
represent H Haskins has mentioned she
 
00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:31.240 align:start position:0%
has an an alternative idea to that so
 
00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
maybe we could hear that
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
now thank you yes I went back and looked
 
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
at the testimony that we received when
 
00:24:42.669 --> 00:24:42.679 align:start position:0%
the bill was aired and
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
um at the time I said that glue trap
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
seemed to me to be a 19th century
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
solution to a problem and surely in the
 
00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
21st century we should be able to come
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
up with something more humane and
 
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
equally effective and so I learned about
 
00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
contraception for rodents which I had
 
00:25:09.389 --> 00:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
not previously known about um I just
 
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
want to suggest also that in reviewing
 
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
the materials I noted that fish and game
 
00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
is opposed to glute traps because they
 
00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
catch non-target wildlife such as song
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
birds and
 
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
snakes aabon was concerned because um
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
the rodents who take this lethal dose of
 
00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.029 align:start position:0%
the rodents who take this lethal dose of
Rosen

00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
Rosen
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
rodenticide become prey for Hawks owls
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
weasels foxes Fishers and other small
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
mammals so you know second generation
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
rodenticides are more lethal that's why
 
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
they're second generation than the
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
previous ones were so contraception for
 
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
rodents um I guess has been out there
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
for a while I hadn't heard about it
 
00:25:58.389 --> 00:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
previously but I did talk with a company
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
called senis
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
Tech and we had quite a long discussion
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
about the fact that this is approved by
 
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
the state it's um sold at Amazon now
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
it's coming to Ace Hardware and farm and
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
feed stores it's basically a sausage
 
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
bait it's a
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
non-lethal method of uh controlling
 
00:26:24.389 --> 00:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
fertility in
 
00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
rodents and it's apparently very
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
effective in
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
the um places where it's been used more
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
extensively like California and other
 
00:26:38.159 --> 00:26:39.669 align:start position:0%
extensively like California and other
places

00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
um rodents mature quickly and have many
 
00:26:51.149 --> 00:26:51.159 align:start position:0%
litters yes every six weeks
 
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
possibly um so this um
 
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
contraception is as I say um
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
non-lethal reasonably
 
00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.269 align:start position:0%
non-lethal reasonably
affordable

00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
and I think first of all with anything
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
environmental we have to start with
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
mitigation whether I'm talking about
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
landfill or plastic or whatever it is
 
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.029 align:start position:0%
landfill or plastic or whatever it is
the

00:27:16.029 --> 00:27:16.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
first case should be you know cleaning
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
up the area making sure the food's not
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
left out all the things that I hope
 
00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
would be common sense to most people so
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
you start with m ation but that's not
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
been enough um and by the way I wanted
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
to say that the um pest control people
 
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
um did indicate to us at the time that
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
there was no alternative to
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
rodenticides this is the
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
alternative I didn't know about it at
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
the time but
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah so I'd like to hear thoughts
 
00:27:59.389 --> 00:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
about this um
 
00:27:59.399 --> 00:28:01.630 align:start position:0%
about this um
they

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:28:05.549 --> 00:28:05.559 align:start position:0%
um since these
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
um rodenticides are
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
poison they um can get in the food chain
 
00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.230 align:start position:0%
poison they um can get in the food chain
and

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
ecosystems and I I really think that
 
00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.389 align:start position:0%
ecosystems and I I really think that
their

00:28:17.389 --> 00:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
exposure to um all manner of pets the
 
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences the non-target
 
00:28:30.269 --> 00:28:30.279 align:start position:0%
animals is perhaps the chief reason why
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
it seemed unacceptable to me that that's
 
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
with thank you
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
um when for mosquitoes that carry
 
00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:46.039 align:start position:0%
diseases they use they use
 
00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
contraceptives a lot and me that's one
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
of the ways that they keep the
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
population down in places um so it can
 
00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
be effective I just don't think it's
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's immediately effective but but you
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
know one one at a time traps are not are
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
probably not any faster than
 
00:29:04.269 --> 00:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
contraception so I I would imagine I
 
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
don't know but representative Aaron
 
00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.630 align:start position:0%
don't know but representative Aaron
thank

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
you I have a couple thoughts on that
 
00:29:15.149 --> 00:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
um well first um
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
with with um
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
contraception I mean on its face it
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
sounds like a really good idea but I
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
would worry about upsetting the um the
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
food chain for I mean if you're going to
 
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
if you're going
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
to ostensibly eradicate the ability of
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh rodents to
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
reproduce What will that do to the
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
population that's available for hawks
 
00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
and birds of prey and other animals that
 
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
do eat those and I mean yes there is a a
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
portion of them that may be
 
00:29:57.789 --> 00:29:57.799 align:start position:0%
poisoned um but there's a probably a
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
great G portion that are not and I I
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
would I would worry that it would
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
disrupt make a big disruption in in the
 
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.430 align:start position:0%
disrupt make a big disruption in in the
food

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
food
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
chain uh overall so um representative
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
Duty sent me an article from the Boston
 
00:30:21.549 --> 00:30:21.559 align:start position:0%
Globe uh about the about um rodent uh uh
 
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
contraception and
 
00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.389 align:start position:0%
contraception and
the

00:30:25.389 --> 00:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:25.399 --> 00:30:26.950 align:start position:0%
the
uh

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
the sort of boiled down to the basic
 
00:30:35.509 --> 00:30:35.519 align:start position:0%
conclusion is that uh it sometimes has
 
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
some positive of effect but is not you
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
uh does not does not completely you know
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
get rid of populations uh one of the one
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
aspect of it is that
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
um with as with human
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
contraceptive uh through pills uh
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
depends on it being taken on a regular
 
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
basis so if they only take the bait that
 
00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
has the contraception in it
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
intermittently then it's not going to be
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
as effective um and uh we also know that
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh contraception the the the pill does
 
00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:21.559 align:start position:0%
not always work so uh and my upstairs
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
neighbor has a grandchild because the
 
00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
pills not always work so um if I may uh
 
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
so uh I actually am not quite finished
 
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
with this thought but uh one of the
 
00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:37.799 align:start position:0%
things that the article pointed out was
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
that uh a potential issue is that uh
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
that might create selective pressure for
 
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
the for the rodents that don't
 
00:31:51.389 --> 00:31:51.399 align:start position:0%
particularly like the type of bait U
 
00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
because uh because the uh if you reduce
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
the reproduction of all the ones who
 
00:32:01.149 --> 00:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
like that bait then the ones who don't
 
00:32:02.669 --> 00:32:02.679 align:start position:0%
like that bait are then going to
 
00:32:06.029 --> 00:32:06.039 align:start position:0%
predominate in the population uh so I
 
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
don't see it as being an issue with the
 
00:32:11.549 --> 00:32:11.559 align:start position:0%
entire po population being wiped out I I
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
do see it see it as being something that
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
may be a mix in a larger in in a larger
 
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
set of approaches but probably does not
 
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
actually it's not going to be the Silver
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
Bullet well it definitely is another
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
tool in the toolbx for sure um and and a
 
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.110 align:start position:0%
tool in the toolbx for sure um and and a
non

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
non
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
um you know poisonous or
 
00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
one but I also have a followup um with
 
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.590 align:start position:0%
one but I also have a followup um with
regard

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
regard
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
to the point about
 
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
capturing non-targeted species I mean if
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
these glue traps are indeed used indoors
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
as they are supposed to be they are not
 
00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to be used Outdoors where they
 
00:33:02.669 --> 00:33:02.679 align:start position:0%
would trap birds or uh turtles or you
 
00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:06.679 align:start position:0%
know small turtles or snakes or whatever
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
um I mean I think that's the
 
00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
problem that perhaps the Autobon society
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
and others may be seeing is that the
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
improper use of these glue traps is what
 
00:33:20.629 --> 00:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
causing is what's causing the the Trap
 
00:33:25.789 --> 00:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
entament of non-targeted species but I I
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
would also reiterate the point of the
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
value of having a non-chemical means of
 
00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
eliminating rodents which is very much
 
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
used in the food industry and um on
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
farms in barns in enclosed areas uh and
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
in other places that
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
uh you know glue traps make sense to use
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm just pointing that out yeah thank
 
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
you we're talking about human behavior
 
00:33:59.950 --> 00:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
avior right it's just like the labeling
 
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
issue you know you can tell people what
 
00:34:04.269 --> 00:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
they should be doing whether they do it
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
or not I mean we have so much testimony
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
from all these Wildlife
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
associations of reptiles birds kittens
 
00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
all manner of squirrels foxes
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
so The
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
lethality is the poison is the part of
 
00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
it that strikes me as untenable that we
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
ought to be able to
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
increase knowledge awareness of
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
mitigation you know the all the simple
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
essential oils all the things that we
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
wish people would do to start with
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
removing the food supply all of that is
 
00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
mitigation but I do agree that a tool in
 
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
the toolbox might
 
00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
make a forward motion in terms of
 
00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
reducing ing the rodent population
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
through a non-lethal means which appeals
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
to me representa compa thank you very
 
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.069 align:start position:0%
to me representa compa thank you very
much

00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
um when we're talking about glue traps
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
we I think we need to understand that
 
00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
rodenticides are not part of the glue
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
trap uh they're two separate
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
issues um and glue traps are
 
00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
non are not poison they're
 
00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.230 align:start position:0%
non are not poison they're
non-toxic

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
non-toxic
 
00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
um I was just at a farm bureau meeting
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
um a week ago literally and we were
 
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
talking about this subject because my
 
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
job is to bring to up What legislation
 
00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
you know is happening in
 
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
conquered and when I told
 
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
them about this bill and trying to ban
 
00:35:51.309 --> 00:35:51.319 align:start position:0%
the glue
 
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
traps they were like you
 
00:35:56.589 --> 00:35:56.599 align:start position:0%
can't um and I'm like well this is what
 
00:35:58.990 --> 00:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
we're hearing in conquer
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
um because and we did talk about birth
 
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
control and how it has been effective in
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
some areas in helping control the
 
00:36:10.109 --> 00:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
population so that was also a topic of
 
00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
discussion um we also talked about uh
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
second generation rodenticide which I
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
believe the EPA is going to be making a
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
ruling on fairly quickly so that will
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
not be an Arsenal for the homeowner so
 
00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
that's coming off the table so you're
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
already taking a tool off
 
00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.829 align:start position:0%
already taking a tool off
glue

00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
glue
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
traps very rarely affect
 
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
Wildlife it's not I don't believe the
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
impact is there that the second
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
generation rodenticide is where that is
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
a huge problem for the Wildlife I mean I
 
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
won't even use it because of my dogs
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
okay but we have to understand that when
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
Farmers I mean we have seed we have food
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
we we have to store this stuff in order
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
to be viable farmers and we do they do
 
00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
the best they can to store it in
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
containers but it still attracts the
 
00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.349 align:start position:0%
containers but it still attracts the
rodents

00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
rodents
 
00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
and although I think contraception is
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
another alternative and something in our
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
toolbox we're already pulling a tool off
 
00:37:22.309 --> 00:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
the table that we have to have
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
non-lethal uh for
 
00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
Animals tools that we can that can be
 
00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
used we we can't we have to think about
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
all everything not just different
 
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
segments and when you're talking about
 
00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
the people that actually supply the food
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
that we eat we have to give them the
 
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:44.200 align:start position:0%
tools to make sure that they're being
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
able to control the problem
 
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
too representa
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
Howard um it seems like we could we
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
could rank these um the options as far
 
00:37:59.230 --> 00:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
as toxicity and and the ripple effect of
 
00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
of that they have on Wildlife on on
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
human safety and stuff like that and it
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
seems that it if every one of them is
 
00:38:08.589 --> 00:38:08.599 align:start position:0%
used according to the directions you
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
know the pesticides and the and the um
 
00:38:14.309 --> 00:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
the glue traps and the contraceptions it
 
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
seems like we we're on the verge of
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
ruling out the pesticides because the
 
00:38:20.109 --> 00:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
ripple effect is is great with wildlife
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
and and and pets and stuff like that um
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that if used according to
 
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
the directions that um the farmers need
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
the glue traps and and I I imagine they
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
are inclined to use them according to
 
00:38:35.069 --> 00:38:35.079 align:start position:0%
the directions because they don't want
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
their other animals stuck in them um and
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
that the contraceptions are a good
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
complement to that because it it reduces
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
the the number of of animals that are
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
susceptible to to be causing problems
 
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
and and stepping on the Trap so um also
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
to uh represented eron's point about the
 
00:38:56.829 --> 00:38:56.839 align:start position:0%
um lowering the food chain availability
 
00:38:59.950 --> 00:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
of it's only it's only verman who go
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
into your barn right or into your into
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
your house that would be susceptible to
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
these uh to this solution so I think
 
00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
that the ones who stay out in the field
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
and do their Wild Thing are still
 
00:39:12.589 --> 00:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
available to foxes and Hawks um and I I
 
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
can I can on my little acreage um
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of those so
 
00:39:25.309 --> 00:39:25.319 align:start position:0%
um so um I'm going to sort
 
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
of uh up until fairly recently like last
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
fall I didn't have any rats in my um on
 
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
my property and that was I considered
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
myself lucky
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
and then some appeared uh and at F at
 
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
first they were just in the wood storage
 
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
shed and in the around the chicken cpop
 
00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:51.079 align:start position:0%
and uh and I thought okay well I'll just
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
you know put out traps and you know and
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
I would get you know a one or two
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
trapped every week and that's you know
 
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
does a little bit to the population but
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
not it certainly is not eradicating them
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
uh and then I noticed that they were
 
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
getting into the crawl space in the
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
house and at that point I thought okay
 
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
this is beyond my skill set probably uh
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to call a professional so
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
I called a professional who came out and
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
looked at the looked at the setup looked
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
at you know the the extent of the garden
 
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
and the Orchard and the chicken Coupe
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
and the fact that the chickens are free
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
free range um they just fly over the
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
electric fences so they they're free
 
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
range whether I can try to contain them
 
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:41.950 align:start position:0%
range whether I can try to contain them
or

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
not so um and uh she said there are so
 
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
many food sources out here that uh uh
 
00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:56.200 align:start position:0%
that is going that there's going to be a
 
00:40:59.950 --> 00:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
lot of difficult y getting them to eat a
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
bait and uh so the bait the poison baits
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
whether the desant or the uh escar are
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
not going to be useful in this situation
 
00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
furthermore because you have chickens
 
00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
out there even if you put the um the
 
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
escar in and clothe spaces in the house
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
rats carry them around so they may end
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
up at in the yard and that would not be
 
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
good for that would be a potential
 
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
problem for the birds so she ruled that
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
out um and then she said your best bet
 
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:37.960 align:start position:0%
trapping with uh traps that are only
 
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
intermittently fire rings so that you
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
can train them to think the food is safe
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
and then it's not uh which doesn't
 
00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:47.480 align:start position:0%
include glute traps I asked about glute
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
traps she
 
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
said um for rats they're pretty useless
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
the rats are just going to k kick dust
 
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
onto them and then do whatever they want
 
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.510 align:start position:0%
onto them and then do whatever they want
so

00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
so uh so that basically means that you
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
know glue traps are really pretty much a
 
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
solution just for mice that are going to
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
be running you know Running Blind you
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
know fairly carelessly along runways
 
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
next to the wall and are not going to be
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
they're not particularly useful for rats
 
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
um which so uh which doesn't mean that
 
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
they're not useful for mice so but I
 
00:42:27.309 --> 00:42:27.319 align:start position:0%
think that uh
 
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
might be some sort of a room for for
 
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
increasing the requirements that they
 
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:43.720 align:start position:0%
areas so I think we're all hopeful that
 
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:47.850 align:start position:0%
the FDA will come out with some I assume
 
00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:49.150 align:start position:0%
the FDA will come out with some I assume
[Music]

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.710 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
greater uh warnings or elimination even
 
00:42:59.309 --> 00:42:59.319 align:start position:0%
of second generation denti sdes I think
 
00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
we we have the information out
 
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
there so for
 
00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
this other
 
00:43:10.109 --> 00:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
idea what I'm hearing is perhaps this is
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
as Judy said the tool in the toolbox to
 
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
add to mitigation efforts which in my
 
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
view you know should be happening as
 
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
well um so reducing a mice population is
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps one way to um add to the
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
other um less lethal um or at least more
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
effective you know I mean I'd love to
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
have them be effective and non-lethal
 
00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
right that would be a perfect scenario I
 
00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
don't know how we get
 
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
there but I was excited about this
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
methodology because I can see that it
 
00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
would be you know helpful um I've sent
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
for this product going to give it to my
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
kids whove bought The Farmhouse because
 
00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think they have the first idea
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
what they're up against um so I can
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
report later on you know how effective
 
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
it is um but yeah I think that's what I
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
where I think we're
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
at okay so do you um
 
00:44:30.549 --> 00:44:30.559 align:start position:0%
what do you envision in terms of
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
legislation for this is this something
 
00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:35.079 align:start position:0%
that for which legislation is
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate at this point or or is it um
 
00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:42.839 align:start position:0%
or is it something where um just having
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
the information about the the
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
contraception more available would be um
 
00:44:50.549 --> 00:44:50.559 align:start position:0%
would be what we
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
need well you know I don't know how
 
00:44:56.549 --> 00:44:56.559 align:start position:0%
effectively we can distribute the
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
information or ask that it be um part of
 
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
the places the purveyors of traps and of
 
00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:09.230 align:start position:0%
the places the purveyors of traps and of
all

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.710 align:start position:0%
all
kinds

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
kinds
 
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
um let's let's hear what our colleagues
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
say um so as far as the
 
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
contraception um I think that you know
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
knowing that we even just had that
 
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
discussion at my Farm Bureau meeting
 
00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
that people are are now talking about it
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
means the information is getting out
 
00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
there but if maybe we could get um you
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
know places like the Farm Bureau to say
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
here's an alternative or um maybe put it
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
on somewhere on a website that this is a
 
00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
new product that is now an alternative
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
um for helping with your rodent
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
population I think it's more about
 
00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
getting the information out but
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
obviously uh the fact I didn't know I
 
00:45:59.710 --> 00:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
mean we talked about contraception here
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
in our committee but then listening to
 
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
the conversation at our Farm Bureau
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
meeting means that people are hearing it
 
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
now from you hearing that it it's
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
readily for sale on Amazon you said so
 
00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
now the you know big retailers are now
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
starting to sell that so you're starting
 
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
to see that um and if that goes well you
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
probably start seeing it in the big box
 
00:46:22.349 --> 00:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
stores or something to that or your
 
00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:25.640 align:start position:0%
Agway or things like that so I think
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
that the more discussions you start
 
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
hearing about means that the information
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
is already getting out there um so
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
that's a positive sign um and maybe
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
organizations like I said the Farm
 
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
Bureau or something can start putting
 
00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.430 align:start position:0%
Bureau or something can start putting
things

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
out yeah I I recall when um the
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture had that uh
 
00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
farm and uh Forest fair in um I think it
 
00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
was in Dearing earlier this um earlier
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
this year there actually was a vendor
 
00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
there that had um a rodent uh
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
contraceptive product that she was
 
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
selling and so I do think that that is
 
00:47:10.109 --> 00:47:10.119 align:start position:0%
uh an upand cominging uh method that
 
00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
people are going to become more aware of
 
00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:15.400 align:start position:0%
and you know with any of these things I
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
really do
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
think the the
 
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
whole um issue falls on public
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
education educating the public on what
 
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
are the different means available to
 
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
them if they're not using um a uh a
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
professional service to help them with
 
00:47:39.549 --> 00:47:39.559 align:start position:0%
their rodent problem I think that you
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
know people are becoming more uh aware
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
of what their choices are and I do
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
believe that um because of you know
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
certain just even you know people don't
 
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
want to be cleaning out cleaning up
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
after glue traps I I don't think that
 
00:47:59.790 --> 00:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
that's actually a very popular
 
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
means for a many people um there are
 
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
farmers that still use it for and and
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
also Food Service people who use it in
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
enclosed areas um what what the thing is
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
is again education for people to know
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
how to use these uh products properly
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
and um and that's I think our biggest
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
thing is is educating the public on how
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
to use these things
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
representative Howard um I agree with
 
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
everything that that um the other
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives have been saying I think
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
that um in terms of legislation this is
 
00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:37.839 align:start position:0%
a ban so I think that we are not going
 
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
to forward this because we're I think it
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
seems like we're in agreement that that
 
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:43.640 align:start position:0%
um that it it's doesn't make sense for a
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
band so um I I just wonder um this might
 
00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
may be a naive question but is there a
 
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
way to as legislators um you know
 
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
encourage a a campaign about the cont
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
cont you know an information campaign
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
about the contraception so that they
 
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
know that it that it's a a a valid tool
 
00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
toolbox so um one possibility would be
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
getting in touch with the department and
 
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
seeing uh whether the IPM program
 
00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
includes this as part of their uh their
 
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
training for uh for people who are
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
getting pesticide
 
00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
licenses uh and so that that would be
 
00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:29.720 align:start position:0%
one way of doing it another another is
 
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
that the department does have certain
 
00:49:34.829 --> 00:49:34.839 align:start position:0%
informational uh material on their
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
website uh and uh so we could uh contact
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and see if this is
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
something that the department might be
 
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
interested in in um in publicizing I
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
think it would be very similar to how
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
has done an entire um public education
 
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
program to let people know you know not
 
00:50:03.309 --> 00:50:03.319 align:start position:0%
to flush things down the toilet that is
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
not flushable because that damages the
 
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
municipal uh sew systems and so and so
 
00:50:11.069 --> 00:50:11.079 align:start position:0%
forth so I mean there our agencies
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
already do do a lot of public education
 
00:50:16.789 --> 00:50:16.799 align:start position:0%
in many different areas and I think this
 
00:50:19.069 --> 00:50:19.079 align:start position:0%
is an area that perhaps the Department
 
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture um could pursue
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um I really
 
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
like the idea of um the IPM uh having
 
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
director Russo get involved uh and
 
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
disseminating this um but I also think
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
that if you
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
because I mean some homeowners probably
 
00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
use the glue traps most people as we
 
00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony and in even in just
 
00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
talking with folks you know are are
 
00:50:50.829 --> 00:50:50.839 align:start position:0%
varing away from them I mean it's
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
already people are already doing that
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
themselves um so I think it's it's more
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:59.750 align:start position:0%
in the
agricultural

00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
agricultural
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh sector that use because not one thing
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
works because they're Prett they they
 
00:51:08.789 --> 00:51:08.799 align:start position:0%
they understand that if there's one
 
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
thing then they they switch their
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
behaviors so we have to be so you just
 
00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
need different tools because you have to
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
switch things up uh in the Arsenal but I
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
think including uh asking the director
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
to include that into the integrated Pest
 
00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
Management program uh represent Bixby is
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:58.270 --> 00:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
touch do you have your mic on
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
sorry all right just repeat that for for
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
the record so uh so I think it makes
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
sense for us to approach the department
 
00:52:08.829 --> 00:52:08.839 align:start position:0%
in terms of including this in their
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
educational uh work and uh we probably
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
need to talk to commissioner Jasper who
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
will then uh uh hopefully direct
 
00:52:21.789 --> 00:52:21.799 align:start position:0%
director Russo to um to work this into
 
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
the uh pesticide training uh information
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
and the IPM information
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
so specifically we would be asking them
 
00:52:33.549 --> 00:52:33.559 align:start position:0%
to include um contraceptive means in the
 
00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
IPM and also to direct people if they
 
00:52:38.349 --> 00:52:38.359 align:start position:0%
are going to use glue traps that they
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
okay representative Howard and and uh
 
00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
can we sort of formalize that we're not
 
00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
that we don't recommend the the ban bill
 
00:52:58.349 --> 00:52:58.359 align:start position:0%
that we um is is we've concluded is we
 
00:52:59.710 --> 00:52:59.720 align:start position:0%
advance that to the back to the
 
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
committee right right so um let me just
 
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
uh did you have a specific uh piece of
 
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
legislation that you were thinking of or
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
that was going to work on this or did or
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
were were you more interested in
 
00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
promoting the idea of the um
 
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
contraception well you know my goal was
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
frankly to ban glue traps that's there
 
00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
just isn't support for it so um
 
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
obviously the education piece is
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
fabulous I mean why would we not do that
 
00:53:37.349 --> 00:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
that that's a great idea but I didn't
 
00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
have other legislation in
 
00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
mind okay so um I think at this point it
 
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
might make sense to um take a uh a
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
committee a subcommittee vote for our
 
00:53:52.589 --> 00:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full committee uh
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
does anyone have a
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
motion would be a motion be to itl the
 
00:53:58.559 --> 00:54:00.630 align:start position:0%
motion would be a motion be to itl the
bill

00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
be your choices are um recommend
 
00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:08.440 align:start position:0%
recommend this legislation for future
 
00:54:11.549 --> 00:54:11.559 align:start position:0%
legislation or not recommend for future
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
legislation I would make a motion not to
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
recommend is there a second okay second
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
and by representative Howard let me just
 
00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:28.069 align:start position:0%
and by representative Howard let me just
um

00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion is
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
um uh do we need uh uh we can do this on
 
00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
a Voice vote right okay so um anyone all
 
00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
in favor u i
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
i I'll opposed uh no okay so
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
um so the
 
00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
uh so our recommendation is to not
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation but
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
recommend uh but recommend that the
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
department provide educational material
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
both on glue traps and on
 
00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:14.109 align:start position:0%
both on glue traps and on
contraception

00:55:14.109 --> 00:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.109 --> 00:55:16.119 align:start position:0%
yes uh yes
 
00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:19.640 align:start position:0%
certainly would it be helpful to also
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
include information about why not to use
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
second generation
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
rodenticides no it doesn't okay
 
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
yes yeah that's that's that's a separate
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
bill and uh just just just to um a a
 
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
little bit of more information on that
 
00:55:38.589 --> 00:55:38.599 align:start position:0%
uh I didn't read it very carefully but I
 
00:55:42.349 --> 00:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
did see a list of what the proposed new
 
00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
regulations uh from the USDA on second
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
generation red genocides are uh
 
00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
and the uh well they did not uh
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
recommend completely Banning them for
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
Homeowner use uh they uh they are only
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
allowing single use uh enclosed bait
 
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
stations for uh for public sale uh and
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
and then further uh and I don't remember
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
what the further restrictions for uh for
 
00:56:20.029 --> 00:56:20.039 align:start position:0%
other sale and use were but but that's
 
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:23.480 align:start position:0%
the the rough uh roughly they were
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of access that
 
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:29.720 align:start position:0%
owners can have it to it uh represent K
 
00:56:34.029 --> 00:56:34.039 align:start position:0%
thank you um so my question is is um
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure when they do the
 
00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:39.880 align:start position:0%
single use uh I'm I hate to assume
 
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
anything but usually when there's a
 
00:56:45.309 --> 00:56:45.319 align:start position:0%
single use uh being done it's in an
 
00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:47.960 align:start position:0%
enclosed thing so that the the rodent
 
00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:50.200 align:start position:0%
will go into something grab that and it
 
00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
will tra get trapped inside um so I'm
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
not sure if that's what they're thinking
 
00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:56.839 align:start position:0%
as a single use
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh I don't I I did not read it carefully
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
enough to be able to answer that
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
question but I'm sure that the that it's
 
00:57:04.349 --> 00:57:04.359 align:start position:0%
on the EPA
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
website and I think I misspoke the first
 
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
time when I said USDA it's the EPA
 
00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
that so um is there any more business uh
 
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
of the subcommittee okay all right so uh
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:55.119 --> 00:58:25.109 align:start position:0%
