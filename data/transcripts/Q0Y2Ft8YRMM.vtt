okay

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.150 align:start position:0%
consent calendar saying none all was in
favor

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
favor
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
okay motioned by mcguire to postpone
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
and would you like to speak to your
 
00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.310 align:start position:0%
and would you like to speak to your
motion

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair i'd like to postpone this
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
the objection response is totally
 
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
inadequate and i would think the
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
department needs another couple of weeks
 
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
to come up with something that'll meet
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
and they should also probably be in
 
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.430 align:start position:0%
and they should also probably be in
attendance

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
so all is in favor and postponement
 
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.190 align:start position:0%
so all is in favor and postponement
hi

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
hi
 
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.110 align:start position:0%
hi
any

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
any objections
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
board of pharmacy
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:14.870 align:start position:0%
this is a
2021-122

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
2021-122
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
there is a conditional approval request
 
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
the only issue is on page five it's a
 
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
note to jail car
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
so oplc is responsible for promulgating
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
rules to establish fees which they have
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
done so in plc 1000
 
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
so the fee mentioned on the conditional
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
approval request here for the board of
 
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
pharmacy on page five of the conditional
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
approval request
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
references that plc1000 and the fee set
 
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
in plc 1002.23
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
for the mail of order pharmacies is set
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
at two thousand dollars it was
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
established in an emergency role
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
updated in an interim role but the
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
interim rule expires on march 21st and
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
as of now the oplc has not um
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
or we have not received a filing from
 
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
oplc for a regular rule for this um
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
plc1000 and so the committee may have
 
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
questions about the expiration of this
 
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.350 align:start position:0%
questions about the expiration of this
fee

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
good morning tina kelly from the office
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
of professional licensure and
 
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.230 align:start position:0%
of professional licensure and
certification

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
and um it is my understanding that oplc
 
00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959 align:start position:0%
will be filing
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair members of the
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
committee for the record lindsey coury
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
executive director office of
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:53.509 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
um

00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
we have had these rules the plc 1002s
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
drafted since i believe september and
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
our intent was to file them in november
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
with the idea that we would have
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
anticipated legislative changes
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately when we sought
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
the consultation and collaboration with
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
the various licensing boards we've
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
received significant pushback from a
 
00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:15.509 align:start position:0%
received significant pushback from a
handful

00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
handful
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
which resulted in a significant delay in
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
us filing rules and ultimately we
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
decided to pare down those rules and
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
only file the rules that are absolutely
 
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.069 align:start position:0%
only file the rules that are absolutely
necessary

00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
we recognize that this will result in
 
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.829 align:start position:0%
we recognize that this will result in
a

00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
a a time period in which we will not
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
have a rule in place and obviously are
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
not able to charge people um but
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that that was the result
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
of uh having to collaborate with 54
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
different sets of boards with different
 
00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:44.959 align:start position:0%
ideas as to
 
00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:51.750 align:start position:0%
ideas as to
fees

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.870 align:start position:0%
 
comments

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
no more comments for me okay questions
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm just curious how you plan to
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
deal with the rush of of licensed
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
applications or you'll be receiving next
 
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:20.389 align:start position:0%
applications or you'll be receiving next
week

00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
in terms of the fees
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
so right now we don't have fees in place
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
for i think it was vets veterinarians
 
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
and there may be one other that we don't
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
have fees in place
 
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.829 align:start position:0%
have fees in place
so

00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
because of this issue that has been
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
ongoing for many years as to
 
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.590 align:start position:0%
ongoing for many years as to
disputes

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
disputes
 
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
as to who has authority to file fees
 
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.710 align:start position:0%
as to who has authority to file fees
regarding

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
our rules regarding fees and what the
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
fee should be how the fee should be
 
00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:45.430 align:start position:0%
fee should be how the fee should be
allocated

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
allocated
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
and so right now we're just processing
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
the applications without charging a fee
 
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
which is obviously concerning because
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
that means that certain certain boards
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
are not meeting their costs the way
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
we've sought to remedy this was through
 
00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.470 align:start position:0%
we've sought to remedy this was through
sb

00:15:59.470 --> 00:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
sb
 
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.030 align:start position:0%
sb
313

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
313
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
which was intended to do a couple of
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
things clarify that oplc has the fee
 
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
setting authority which is the
 
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
legislation i think that we've discussed
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
previously with this committee
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately again we received some
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
significant pushback from
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
several of the associations and boards
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
and so ultimately that bill has been
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
amended by the committee i think as of
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
last week senate ways and means
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
to essentially
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
create a study committee to study the
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
issue of fees
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
and how fees should be
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
or cost to be allocated so there is
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
going to be another delay unfortunately
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
that will mean that several of our
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
licensing boards or individuals within
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
our licensing boards are continuing to
 
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
pay well above 125
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
and some are not meeting costs
 
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i think that's just you
 
00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
know that's the way the cookie crumbles
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
when we have to
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
see collaboration and consensus and we
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
anticipate having this worked out
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully next legislative session
 
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt they essentially
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
will um
 
00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
so what are our options
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
well the committee could vote to approve
 
00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:24.799 align:start position:0%
the rule or the conditional approval
 
00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:25.829 align:start position:0%
the rule or the conditional approval

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:38.549 align:start position:0%

um

00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
based on the note to gel card it doesn't
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
appear that there is a basis for
 
00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:49.830 align:start position:0%
appear that there is a basis for
objection

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead carol how many
 
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
out-of-state pharmacies are you do you
 
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.789 align:start position:0%
out-of-state pharmacies are you do you

representative i'm sorry i don't know
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
the number off the top of my head i will
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
say that the renewal schedule is not
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
until december so while we may receive
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
application new applications i don't
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%

ms courtney can certainly correct me but
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
i think there have been about 22 000

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
the question i have here well let me
 
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
explain this issue first
 
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.710 align:start position:0%
explain this issue first
currently

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
all applicants for renewal or for
 
00:19:40.799 --> 00:19:42.789 align:start position:0%
all applicants for renewal or for
reinstatement

00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
reinstatement
 
00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
have to show that they've been active in
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
practice practice
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
if they have not been active in practice
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
then they have to go through a program
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
through oplc
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
the emergency rule would limit the
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
active and practice requirements to only
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
those who have not held a license for at
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
the board thinks this will expedite
 
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
reinstatement of nursing professionals
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
my question is is there a real emergency
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
here since the pandemic seems to be
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
waning at least temporarily
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
and 22 000 licenses have been issued so
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure whether this
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
falls under the need for an emergency or
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
good morning again for the record
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
lindsey courtney executive director
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
office of professional ace insurance
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
certification i'm here um today
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
representing the board of nursing with
 
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
respect to its emergency filing
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
i think that there are probably two
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
different issues here i think there's
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
certainly the pandemic is winding down
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
but i think that we are in a real
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
emergency as it relates to healthcare
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
workforce that's separate and distinct
 
00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.669 align:start position:0%
workforce that's separate and distinct
from

00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
the big endemic and we were seeing that
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
obviously prior to coven i think it was
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
exacerbated due to covid
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
but we are still seeing a significant
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
issue with respect to workforce
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
i think it's due to a number of factors
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
obviously people getting burned out
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
during covid
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
but obviously our aging population in
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and it's clear that we do
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
not have a
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
significant or sufficient number of
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
health care workforce individuals in
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
order to meet our needs
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
so i think with that said the board of
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
nursing decided to pursuant to the
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
governor's executive order utilize the
 
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
tools available in his toolkit we i
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
believe were the only state
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
that required this active and practice
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
requirement for those renewing this was
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
a significant barrier and has been a
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
significant barrier particularly for
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
individuals who may leave the workforce
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
for a couple years let's say
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
to raise a child or to care for a sick
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
loved one
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
they would have to undergo a re-entry
 
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.190 align:start position:0%
they would have to undergo a re-entry
program

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
that was essentially non-existent it was
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult for people to find
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
a valid re-entry program so essentially
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
prevented people from re-entering the
 
00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.750 align:start position:0%
prevented people from re-entering the
workforce

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
and given the fact that the state
 
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.590 align:start position:0%
and given the fact that the state
was

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
the only one to require this requirement
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
the board of nursing felt that
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
not necessary and given the workforce
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
challenges we have that it was an
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
emergency and they promulgated this
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
emergency role
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um thank you um miss
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
courtney so
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
the if there isn't
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
some kind of formal training program
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
reentry program this will
 
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
just for the trust of the public the
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility will fall on the
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
employers so hospitals nursing homes
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
health care practices
 
00:22:49.919 --> 00:22:50.630 align:start position:0%
health care practices
do

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
are they going to have competency pro i
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
mean it's kind of outside of your
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
purview but what's your knowledge of
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
this are they going to be taking on
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
the competency and basically onboarding
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
these folks
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so this would only be limited to
 
00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
individuals who've been out of the
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
workforce for five years or less
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
the board felt comfortable that within
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
five years
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
you'd be able to reenter the workforce
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
the employer could assess your
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
competency skills as they were required
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
to do anyways you could receive
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
continuing education but they didn't
 
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
feel that it was necessary to require
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
the individual to take the nclex again
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
for example and or go through a re-entry
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
program which is pretty
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
extensive after the five years they
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
would have to do that
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
in order to re-enter the workforce
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%

on wednesday
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
the department is adopting the emergency

rule on involuntary emergency admissions
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
to designated receiving facilities
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
or to the new hampshire hospital

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
2021-9
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
it directed
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
because of mental health crisis in the
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
state it directed
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
dhhs to create emergency rules
 
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
to immediately increase access to
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
services in order to address the mental
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
health crisis
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
it includes requirements for policies
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
and standards by which a hospital must
 
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
treat patients with mental health
 
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.430 align:start position:0%
treat patients with mental health
concerns

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
these rules
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
are specific to
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
emergency admissions involuntary
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
admissions they're about 10 pages long
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
and there's about 10 pages of forms
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
i note that it's been 10 months since
 
00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
the order came out from the governor
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
but given this topic of these rules
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's a legal nightmare and i can
 
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
understand where it would take a long
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
time to
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
do this
 
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
i did have a concern about whether there
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
more specific statute
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
regarding emergency admission but
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
christina has pointed out that there is
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
indeed a statute regarding this
 
00:26:17.039 --> 00:26:18.070 align:start position:0%
indeed a statute regarding this
so

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
