employers of 15 more
 
00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
employees uh it does require them to
 
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
inform the employee of uh policies
 
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
regarding acral or unused time and
 
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
limits so this is good this is a good
 
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
business sense that's has been described
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
to me providing means uh where the
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
requests and approvals are process

further good business sense and PR
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
practice uh providing employees with
 
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
accounting of earned time and un use
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
time remaining again consistent with
 
00:24:28.389 --> 00:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
normal business practices and
 
00:24:28.399 --> 00:24:30.310 align:start position:0%
normal business practices and
and

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
um what we're doing here is we're saying
 
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
if the employee is is separated from un
 
00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.909 align:start position:0%
if the employee is is separated from un
from

00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
employment uh not fired but separated uh
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
the business closes the ownership
 
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
changes it's a seasonal employment with
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
no reasonable Assurance of the employee
 
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
being able to return to work Mr Abbott
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
you're welcome uh then the unused paid
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
time such as vacation will will be paid
 
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
but not sick days because we don't want
 
00:24:58.029 --> 00:24:58.039 align:start position:0%
you to get sick and if you know you
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
don't get sick but your unused vacation
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
time would be paid and for employers
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
that don't delineate the types of paid
 
00:25:07.149 --> 00:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
off they just have PTO all One bank they
 
00:25:09.389 --> 00:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
said it's all One bank then it stays all
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
One Bank uh with the exception of sick
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
if they don't if they want to parse it
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
out somehow and this would be paid uh to
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
the employee which as we we know is
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
common practice but in in New Hampshire
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
and many other states it's not required
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
but this would require it in the
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
conditions where the person through no
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
fault to their own P the employment ends
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh there's no not for cause but the
 
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
employment just ends uh and that's the
 
00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:52.039 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr chairman
 
00:25:56.269 --> 00:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
um can I ask the sponsor a
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
question yes
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
um under
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
onea or in time shall be paid in a
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
pro-rated basis is that prated how well
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
prated as in uh the person the the
 
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
person has worked for six months and
 
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
then the the job ends so any
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
unused would be would be like divided by
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
example so you don't get all you don't
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
get everything that was promised to you
 
00:26:29.389 --> 00:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
on day one or given to you on day one
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
you get appropriate to the time of the
 
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
amount of time that's passed since the
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
when the employment
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
ends and a followup question what if the
 
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
employer wanted to pay all of it uh
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that would prevent them
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
from doing that this is only what they
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
would be required to do it's a shall be
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
paid on a prated basis that's why I'm
 
00:26:49.279 --> 00:26:50.590 align:start position:0%
paid on a prated basis that's why I'm
just

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:26:54.909 --> 00:26:54.919 align:start position:0%
checking um yes the the shell is so that
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
they will and anyone who wants to give
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
penalty thank you thank you Mr
 
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
chairman representative K Hill you and I
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
have oh I'm sorry representative
 
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
proud um thank you Mr chair um so my
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
concern uh with this bill is that
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
appears to be retroactive to vacation
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
time earned before the effective day of
 
00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
the bill um this will companies to make
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
changes in that 59 days before it
 
00:27:33.149 --> 00:27:33.159 align:start position:0%
becomes effective and uh address the new
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
liability that's coming their way um
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
because the value of the full unused
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
balance of the vacation time of all
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
employees will suddenly show up on their
 
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
accounting sheets on their balance sheet
 
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
Um this can affect the company's credit
 
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
rating their ability to get a bank loan
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
and other issues uh I'd be much more
 
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
open to this topic if it only affected
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
time earned after the effective date of
 
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
this bill um but as written applying to
 
00:27:57.149 --> 00:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
the full outstanding balance of uh the
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
vacation time as of the effective of the
 
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
law I can't support it well thank you Mr
 
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
Prout uh I suppose that that could be uh
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
examined in the other
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
chamber uh but I I don't think it's a
 
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
significant problem for the you know for
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
the number of employees and the
 
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
likelihood that there that there's going
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
to be a layoff or you know of this of
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
this magnitude uh and I think uh it's a
 
00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
reasonable very reasonable measured bill
 
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
and if uh if you like to uh join me in
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
the senate for the hearing and offer
 
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:32.200 align:start position:0%
that suggestion I'm sure they would take
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.029 --> 00:28:40.039 align:start position:0%

00:29:15.549 --> 00:29:15.559 align:start position:0%
and the request I had made to uh to
 
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
legislative Services was just
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
that um I didn't get it done on time I
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
I've been trying to take care of for
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
this committee um I am going to vote
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
against this and I will tell you what
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
I'm another thing I'm going to do with
 
00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.509 align:start position:0%
I'm another thing I'm going to do with
representative

00:29:47.509 --> 00:29:47.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
McKenzie if you and I can agree on the
 
00:29:54.389 --> 00:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
amendment which I'm waiting for
 
00:29:57.149 --> 00:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
legislative Services I'm happy to bring
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
that that out as a floor Amendment and
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
support it if you and I agree on the
 
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
house floor before we have crossover or
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
even before next week um but with some
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
of the things that are in here I'm I'm
 
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
still wishy-washy on the seasonal and I
 
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
I don't like lines 13 and
 
00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.269 align:start position:0%
I don't like lines 13 and
14

00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
14
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
um but I i' I've given you I've told you
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
a number of times I would support an
 
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
employee separate SE ated from
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
employment uh because the business
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
closed change owner and changed
 
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
ownership which is what I'm willing to
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
do um but I I again I I should have had
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
this I I wanted to have this
 
00:30:42.669 --> 00:30:42.679 align:start position:0%
conversation with you over the telephone
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
or in person I'm sorry to do it here um
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
this is as close as it's it's come to
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
being something I think but I don't
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
think that your comments to
 
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
representative Prout about trying to
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
deal with this in the Senate um last
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
year uh when the bill passed the house
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
it went over to the Senate and and it
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
didn't really get uh its
 
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
due it got you
 
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
know no disrespect to you they got beat
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
up uh and I want to make something
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
that's going to that I I believe will
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
pass the Senate so I'm just letting you
 
00:31:17.629 --> 00:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
know ahead of time what my plan is um
 
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately why I can't support
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
your Amendment all right uh thank you Mr
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
chairman I as as you as you well know I
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
I have been diligent in trying to get
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
this to going and and talk with you and
 
00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:31.799 align:start position:0%
sent uh word smithing to Mr alalani and
 
00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:34.039 align:start position:0%
reached out to the committee uh tried to
 
00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
accommodate Mr Abbott's concerns with
 
00:31:39.149 --> 00:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
the seasonal business uh you know
 
00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
threading the needle with uh it's
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
challenging and
 
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh I I agree that it could use a bit
 
00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:50.519 align:start position:0%
more work but I I haven't seen what it
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
is that you're trying to get from OS I
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
want to go forward with this and it
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
could be amended perhaps to our
 
00:31:59.549 --> 00:31:59.559 align:start position:0%
agreement agement with a floor Amendment
 
00:32:02.509 --> 00:32:02.519 align:start position:0%
so uh uh I'm asking the members to
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
support this because it's a it's a it's
 
00:32:06.909 --> 00:32:06.919 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do it's a positive
 
00:32:09.629 --> 00:32:09.639 align:start position:0%
step and we'll see what we can figure
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
out when it comes to the before it comes
 
00:32:13.149 --> 00:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
to the floor we'll have to make an
 
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.629 --> 00:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
discussion repres
 
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
suiv um I just want to offer my support
 
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
for the uh for the process um
 
00:32:27.389 --> 00:32:27.399 align:start position:0%

the floor um uh once we we've seen that
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%

motion we've been around this uh Bush
 
00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:52.359 align:start position:0%
quite a few times um right to work has
 
00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
always been bad for New Hampshire um it
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
continues to be bad for new Hampshire um
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
and and frankly um it's especially bad
 
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
in the year when um unions are coming
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
back strong um I mean tell the UPS uh
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
workers that this is a good idea tell
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
the um UAW workers this is a good idea
 
00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
um unions are coming back this bill is
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
designed to weaken unions and uh nothing
 
00:41:28.109 --> 00:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
uh should be further from our minds in a
 
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
year like this um so I strongly oppose
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
um this bill and I urge everyone else to
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
do the same thank you thank you
 
00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:39.950 align:start position:0%
do the same thank you thank you
representative

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
Granger thank you Mr chair um this this
 
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
year is going to be like many prior
 
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
years and uh 2023 has shown that it was
 
00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
once again the lowest rate of union
 
00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
membership in recorded memory and that's
 
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
been the case basically every year for
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
close to 40 years now um we could talk
 
00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
about how I I believe that I believe
 
00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:08.119 align:start position:0%
this is going to come back whether it
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
passes this year or not every two years
 
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
until it either passes or it becomes
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
irrelevant because nobody's in a union
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
anymore and that seems to be the way
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
that it's trending and I don't want to
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
interrupt anybody if who wants to be in
 
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
a union um but the I don't think that
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
independent workers should be held
 
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
hostage uh in order give unions more
 
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
negotiating power uh being an
 
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
independent worker supporting
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
independent workers is important to me
 
00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:35.480 align:start position:0%
therefore I will oppose the itl
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
motion representative Susi thank you Mr
 
00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
chairman I look at it a different
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
way the bill comes to us I've been here
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
14 years it's been here we've defeated
 
00:42:52.829 --> 00:42:52.839 align:start position:0%
it so last year when the bill came we it
 
00:42:55.549 --> 00:42:55.559 align:start position:0%
was coming before us we got an email
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
plus we got letters from National right
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
to work so I decided that I'm going to
 
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
take one of those letters and I'm going
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
to send an email because when I saw that
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
they said 80% of New Hampshire people
 
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
support right to work I did my own study
 
00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
I went out I saw about a 100 people and
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
I asked them if they knew what right to
 
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:14.829 align:start position:0%
I asked them if they knew what right to
work

00:43:14.829 --> 00:43:14.839 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
was and I can almost guarantee that 60%
 
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
of them said everybody should have the
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
right to work everybody should have the
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
right to work and we all believe that so
 
00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
it was false avat ment on the national
 
00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
Right to Work Foundation to come out
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
here put a letter out to Democrats send
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
it to my house but I did a study that's
 
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
the first thing secondly if you look
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
around this room we have businesses here
 
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
now some people say may say that unions
 
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
are not business however they are
 
00:43:50.589 --> 00:43:50.599 align:start position:0%
associations and I brought this up three
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
years ago when we defeated right to
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
work I believe that any individual that
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
represents another member should get
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
paid they should get paid we have
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
lobbyists here that have many clients
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
they have members they can charge their
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
members fees dues whatever they get paid
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
people will say well they don't have to
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
join pretty simple you don't have to
 
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
join a union either so we're going to
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
sit here we're going to discriminate
 
00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
against a private company because they
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
have a union logo and say oh you're the
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
only ones that can't charge your members
 
00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
fees to represent you we're
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't believe that's an a hemp
 
00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
way honestly let's look at it that way
 
00:44:39.309 --> 00:44:39.319 align:start position:0%
it's a business perspective and again
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
Mike's last bill and I talked to Brian
 
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
about this I don't believe we interfere
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
in businesses I don't believe we stick
 
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
our nose in
 
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
there I'd like to see this bill get
 
00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:53.240 align:start position:0%
defeated because I think once again
 
00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
we're getting involved in private
 
00:44:59.790 --> 00:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
businesses where we've heard this if the
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
company's Union you don't want to work
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
there you don't want to work for a union
 
00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
there's other employment and I hate to
 
00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
say it that way but there is other
 
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
employment so I don't support right to
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%

ibw locals in in uh in Massachusetts um
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
in 1974 I got a a job that was a
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
Teamsters Union uh represent it had
 
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
Teamsters Union representation and uh
 
00:45:50.829 --> 00:45:50.839 align:start position:0%
the business agent literally went out to
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
went out to dinner went out to lunch
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
with the bosses three times a week uh
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
came back very inebriated I don't know
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
what went on or anything else but
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
whenever we needed him he wasn't there
 
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
and it would have been real nice to say
 
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
hey uh Mr O you know no more you're not
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
getting another nickel for me till you

start doing your job I'd be fired if I
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
didn't do mine and he should have been
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
fed but there was no means of doing that
 
00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
uh not not any means that we could uh
 
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
you know uh muster enough to enough
 
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:21.559 align:start position:0%
votes for but uh you know the fact of
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
the matter is uh he wasn't representing
 
00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
us um I've also worked in in a non-union
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
shop where four people were killed and
 
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh we were running you know 80 90 hours
 
00:46:34.549 --> 00:46:34.559 align:start position:0%
a week and if there was a a a union it
 
00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
was Union representation there uh any
 
00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
business agent worth of salt would have
 
00:46:40.589 --> 00:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
said hey put another butt in that seat
 
00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
you know and and and and knock this off
 
00:46:44.589 --> 00:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
uh the the man that uh was driving the
 
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
truck when the four people were killed
 
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
had 95 hours under his belt you know
 
00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
that week um so so I do have and and one
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
other thing I I helped organize um a a
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%

that on the other hand uh I'm I'm a a
 
00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
freedom and liberty guy uh I don't
 
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
believe we should be forcing anybody to
 
00:47:14.109 --> 00:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
buy a product Union representation and
 
00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:16.040 align:start position:0%

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to uh you know uh
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
representative Susi mentioned uh you
 
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
know the the uh the fact that unions
 
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
have to represent that's that's a
 
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
federal issue you know Federal label law
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%

out uh as far as the state of New
 
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire goes uh we should not be
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%

legislation is a state government
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%

chairman uh this is the 19th time that
 
00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:49.240 align:start position:0%
I've seen this legislation um and fought
 
00:49:53.069 --> 00:49:53.079 align:start position:0%
against the uh fought against this
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
legislation but I can tell you this that
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
the presentations that were
 
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
made uh during the two days that we had
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh hearings here were
 
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
compelling they were people whose lives
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
were altered and changed and
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
improved by the union representation and
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
no disrespect to my
 
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559 align:start position:0%
colleague uh there are outliers and I
 
00:50:20.789 --> 00:50:20.799 align:start position:0%
understand that but for the most part
 
00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
the people came here said look at my
 
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
life is better my family's life is
 
00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
better we've done a good job uh
 
00:50:32.589 --> 00:50:32.599 align:start position:0%
protecting uh protecting our our our job
 
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
and our families and that's compelling
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
stuff on the other hand we heard from
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
pres presentations from people from I
 
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
think was the associated general
 
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
contractors and also the right to work
 
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
and in both cases they made accusations
 
00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:52.359 align:start position:0%
um and represented certain things before
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
this committee uh one of which was a
 
00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
expression uh in their uh in their
 
00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
statement about all the violence and all
 
00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
of the coercion and all of those things
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
and as you might recall I asked them to
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
provide some evidence to support the
 
00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
statement that they made publicly before
 
00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
this committee and I've received nothing
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of the right to work committee
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
who quoted a contract provision from the
 
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
United Auto Workers and I asked them to
 
00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
provide evidence to show this committee
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
that in fact that was true because they
 
00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:31.640 align:start position:0%
were they were quoting something which
 
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
was illegal under the federal law
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
compelling people to join the union and
 
00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
denying them the opportunity to work in
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
a plan which is illegal you cannot deny
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
somebody the right to work in a in any
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
job you cannot fire them because they
 
00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to be part of of the Union
 
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
they have the right to make that
 
00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
decision that has already been decided
 
00:51:57.069 --> 00:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
by by the federal
 
00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
courts so this has come up over and over
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
again and it's a people say it's about
 
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
Freedom well let me say that for those
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
of us who are in unions and I've been a
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
member of the fir figh Union for 50
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
years um it's my freedom it I had the
 
00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
freedom to be a member of the uh local
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
856 for the past 50 years it was a
 
00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
wonderful and continuous to be a
 
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
wonderful experience and I think many of
 
00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
the people who who are came to testify
 
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
had the same had the same uh
 
00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
thing this is not necessary and I have
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
done this 19 times now as a president of
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
the AFL CIO I I fought against this
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
through every Administration over the
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
past 19 uh years and it's the same old
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
tired story it's the same old tired
 
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
story with a couple of different twist
 
00:52:58.589 --> 00:52:58.599 align:start position:0%
nobody's being compelled or forced to be
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
in a union nobody that's not it's
 
00:53:03.069 --> 00:53:03.079 align:start position:0%
illegal to do that you can work anywhere
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
you want to work now you may make a
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
decision that you don't uh you don't
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
want to work there because it is a union
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
environment but nobody's being forced in
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
or denied employment
 
00:53:16.349 --> 00:53:16.359 align:start position:0%
opportunities and let me finally say
 
00:53:18.589 --> 00:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
this when I questioned one of the
 
00:53:18.599 --> 00:53:20.069 align:start position:0%
this when I questioned one of the
witnesses

00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
witnesses
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
about uh about the benefits it was a
 
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
former police officer and teacher who
 
00:53:28.789 --> 00:53:28.799 align:start position:0%
did not want to be part of the
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
union and I understand that but I also
 
00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
asked her um what happened when the
 
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
contract was
 
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
negotiated and the people in that Local
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
Union paid people to come in and
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
negotiate that collective bargaining
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
agreement I I asked I said did you take
 
00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:48.349 align:start position:0%
agreement I I asked I said did you take
the

00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
benefits that were negotiated by
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
somebody that you had that you made no
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
contribution to whatsoever now the the
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
Union's not going to the unions can't
 
00:53:58.990 --> 00:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
complain about that that's Our
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
obligation but they took it they took
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
that money and they took the benefits as
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
they continue to do and contribute
 
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
nothing to to uh to uh making that
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
happen and I think that that's an
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
inequity and I think that's unfair to
 
00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
the people who are who are part of the
 
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
union and finally let me say this is
 
00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
this is an initiative of the right to
 
00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:23.839 align:start position:0%
work committee
 
00:54:26.349 --> 00:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
nationally and what their initiative is
 
00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
and what their goal is is to weaken the
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
labor movement it has been that way for
 
00:54:35.069 --> 00:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
all the years that I've been doing this
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
if we can figure out says the right to
 
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
work some way of putting a wedge into
 
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
the workplaces of this country if we can
 
00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
end up with people who who uh who don't
 
00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
want to be in the union you end up with
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
a situation where you weaken the union
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
and you weaken the union so it's no
 
00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
longer effective now I don't think
 
00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
that's what the federal law says you
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
have the right to organize you have the
 
00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
right to to freely join unions but the
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
right to but the the initiative of the
 
00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
right to work is to weaken us and
 
00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
destroy the labor movement in this
 
00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
country and so Mr chairman I strongly
 
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
oppose uh this legislation as I have for
 
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
many many years and I joined with
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
hundreds of State reps both Democrat and
 
00:55:23.549 --> 00:55:23.559 align:start position:0%
Republican who over this 19 years 19
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
times that I've been doing this have
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
said no to the right to work over and
 
00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:32.039 align:start position:0%
over and over again enough is enough we
 
00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
have big problems that we need to face
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
in the state and the fact that we're
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
spending our time sitting here today
 
00:55:40.029 --> 00:55:40.039 align:start position:0%
dealing with an issue that has been
 
00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
rejected over and over and over again by
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
the state legislature I think is UN is
 
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
unfair and I don't think it's
 
00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate for for this so I hope these
 
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
members of this committee say no that's
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
enough thank you Mr chairman R broody
 
00:55:58.349 --> 00:55:58.359 align:start position:0%
Follow by love thank you Mr chairman I
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
came here today knowing I wasn't going
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
to say a word but somebody hit the wrong
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
button on me when um they said that um
 
00:56:10.589 --> 00:56:10.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned false
 
00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:13.240 align:start position:0%
advertising well I got a couple things
 
00:56:16.589 --> 00:56:16.599 align:start position:0%
that personally happened to
 
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:20.680 align:start position:0%
me I grew up across the street from a a
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
family of which um with five kids
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
I was in Hanford Supermarket one day and
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
there the youngest of them all a single
 
00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
mother working three jobs to support her
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
son and to buy him those expensive
 
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
sneakers like all the other kids she she
 
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
didn't have a
 
00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:43.160 align:start position:0%
dime and I had never had a conversation
 
00:56:45.789 --> 00:56:45.799 align:start position:0%
with this young lady but she approached
 
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
me in the store with a big smile and
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
said Mr buuy um I was thinking of you
 
00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
the other day she said I gave those
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
working people some money I didn't have
 
00:56:59.630 --> 00:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of money I only sent them
 
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
$20 and I said what working people she
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
said the ones that make it right for
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
everybody to work I said the right to
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
work committee and she said
 
00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
yes it was a dagger in my heart this
 
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
young girl was taken advantage of by
 
00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:18.309 align:start position:0%
young girl was taken advantage of by
false

00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
false
 
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
advertising she didn't have the $20 to
 
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:24.200 align:start position:0%
give but she gave it because of me she
 
00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
said it you're the labor guy and I was
 
00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
it and another person approached me a
 
00:57:38.349 --> 00:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
former uh girlfriend's brother who sells
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
wigs chewed me out one day for voting
 
00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:43.160 align:start position:0%
against right to work he said why would
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
you do that you're supposed to be a
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
labor guy I said I am I said do you know
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
what the right to work
 
00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
was and well he wound up sending them
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
$100 and when I explained what the right
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
to work all did he was mad at himself
 
00:57:59.870 --> 00:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
me and on another note I fought as many
 
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:05.720 align:start position:0%
battles as brother
 
00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
McKenzie and um after the big telephone
 
00:58:12.029 --> 00:58:12.039 align:start position:0%
Strike Back In the late
 
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
90s uh which cost billions of dollars at
 
00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
the time we had this come up the very
 
00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
next year Well less than a year later
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
the president of the local I think AT&amp;T
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
or whatever showed up to vote against it
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
to ask us to vote against it and I asked
 
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
them why I said after a very bitter
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
strike which cost your company a lot of
 
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
money why would you come to defend this
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh to ask us to vote against this bill
 
00:58:45.069 --> 00:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
he said it's
 
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:47.720 align:start position:0%
fairness he says we'll we'll fight it
 
00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:51.400 align:start position:0%
out over the table but I think the fair
 
00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
thing to do is to let the unions
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
organize and elect D and that's after a
 
00:58:59.950 --> 00:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
guy who just got beat up for a four or
 
00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
five month
 
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
strike so between the false advertising
 
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:07.640 align:start position:0%
and large companies really want
 
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
organized people they don't want an HR
 
00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
department with 50 people because
 
00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
everybody in the plant's coming up
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
looking for their own raise or their own
 
00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:18.440 align:start position:0%
benefits you get a master contract
 
00:59:20.589 --> 00:59:20.599 align:start position:0%
everybody lives under it and they don't
 
00:59:23.029 --> 00:59:23.039 align:start position:0%
have to negotiate with every Union every
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
person in their building thank you Mr

to
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
pay the problem I as I understand it is
 
01:01:50.269 --> 01:01:50.279 align:start position:0%
exclusive rights bargaining
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%

I don't want to join a union and and I'm
 
01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
doing like representative barui said and
 
01:02:00.269 --> 01:02:00.279 align:start position:0%
I'd have the right to do it to go
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
negotiate my own salary my own benefits
 
01:02:05.309 --> 01:02:05.319 align:start position:0%
and all that um you know it it can make
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
a mess but uh you know if if I end up
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
better than the union you know than the
 
01:02:11.309 --> 01:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
Union contract boy that the people be
 
01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
screaming you know uh unions want
 
01:02:17.069 --> 01:02:17.079 align:start position:0%
exclusive rights okay um I shouldn't I
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be held you know uh held to to
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
join a an organization that I don't want
 
01:02:26.029 --> 01:02:26.039 align:start position:0%
to belong to it's just simple as that um
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
you know I should have that choice no M
 
01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:29.839 align:start position:0%
and you know I I was impressed with all
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
the all the benefits and as a matter of
 
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.480 align:start position:0%

and I would say if you believe in
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
freedom and the ability for businesses
 
01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
to negotiate with their members if you
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
value your union
 
01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
card uh in private employment you should
 
01:04:11.549 --> 01:04:11.559 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill um everything
 
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
that um well I could say a lot more I
 
01:04:16.349 --> 01:04:16.359 align:start position:0%
think I'll just leave it at that but I
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
just feel hearing that someone was happy
 
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
to have a Teamster
 
01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:26.039 align:start position:0%
card that that view should correlate
 
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
with opposing this bill um I know this
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
because I've lived it I also have worked
 
01:04:34.269 --> 01:04:34.279 align:start position:0%
for labor unions myself including the
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
international AFL CIO and
 
01:04:37.559 --> 01:04:39.750 align:start position:0%
international AFL CIO and

DC
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
um it's made for a stronger economy and
 
01:04:46.029 --> 01:04:46.039 align:start position:0%
a stronger workplace when unions Thrive
 
01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that thank you repres
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
Clair Follow by stop thank you Mr chair
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
first off sorry rep rep love for all the
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
dismay that you've had to face in the
 
01:04:58.349 --> 01:04:58.359 align:start position:0%
past it sounds like you'd probably still
 
01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
be a member if that one person didn't
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
put a bad taste in your mouth which like
 
01:05:05.349 --> 01:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie said I mean
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
we're all far from perfect you know so
 
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
there are some bad seeds everywhere you
 
01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:13.640 align:start position:0%
go and I agree with that um one thing I
 
01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily agree with what
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative Granger said about
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
the are unions still
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
relevant if they weren't why are we
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
trying so hard to get get rid of them
 
01:05:29.309 --> 01:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
that's my question um and that's all
 
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
this is trying to do is is undermine and
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
make them weaker um and much to the
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
points of other Representatives this is
 
01:05:39.789 --> 01:05:39.799 align:start position:0%
this has been going on for I don't know
 
01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
50 years 40 50 years in New Hampshire
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
and we're going to probably itl bills
 
01:05:48.269 --> 01:05:48.279 align:start position:0%
that have only been out for a couple of
 
01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
months I don't understand why this one
 
01:05:52.589 --> 01:05:52.599 align:start position:0%
keep coming up after so many years and
 
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
knockdowns after so many years if we
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
really don't
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
want bills that are irrelevant to happen
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
then why vote in favor of this one um
 
01:06:04.319 --> 01:06:08.109 align:start position:0%
then why vote in favor of this one um
also

01:06:08.109 --> 01:06:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I lost my Chain of Thought
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
but um for now that's that's all thank
 
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:15.720 align:start position:0%

01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
stab thank you Mr chairman um I just
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
would like to uh speak as the as a
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
consumer um I own a very old house and I
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
frequently need Carpenters I frequently
 
01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
need electrici electricians and I
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
frequently need plumbers um and um we
 
01:06:38.349 --> 01:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
recently had a big uh project on our
 
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
house we had to rebuild a porch and the
 
01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:43.480 align:start position:0%
two gentlemen uh who did it said well
 
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
this is our last job we're going to
 
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
retire and we can't find young people to
 
01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
take our place and um you know there's
 
01:06:54.789 --> 01:06:54.799 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of um um of people
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
talking about how we need to get more
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
people in the trades you know you don't
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
need a college degree um as I was
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimony I my ears
 
01:07:04.829 --> 01:07:04.839 align:start position:0%
would perk up every time they talked
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
about how they were training
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
electricians how they were training uh
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh carpenters and um and other trades
 
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
people and I think that you know while
 
01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get more people into the
 
01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:21.640 align:start position:0%
trades and it's the unions that are um
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
big players in making that happen
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
so that these people can can get into
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
these fields and have a satisfying life
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
and make a decent living I think this is
 
01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
probably the last time uh last time that
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
we would want to be undermining them and
 
01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
preventing them from um helping to
 
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
create the next generation of traits
 
01:07:45.789 --> 01:07:45.799 align:start position:0%
people so um I will be um um I I am
 
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
going to be voting against this bill and
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
in favor of it Ling it because yeah we
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
don't need this thank you thank you
 
01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:55.160 align:start position:0%
representative kahill
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair as as you know I've
 
01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
had some trouble getting an electrician
 
01:08:00.549 --> 01:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
come to my house and fix a couple of
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
things and my wife in her wisdom told me
 
01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:06.799 align:start position:0%
not to touch it so we we do need to
 
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
wait uh I was on the phone just
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday with a member of the ibw the
 
01:08:14.109 --> 01:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
business manager because I was asking
 
01:08:16.669 --> 01:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
about the uh if he if they have any
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
experience with people coming out of the
 
01:08:20.189 --> 01:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
job course Center in Manchester because
 
01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
they have an electrical electrical
 
01:08:24.829 --> 01:08:24.839 align:start position:0%
program and he told me that they they
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
have in the past but basically most of
 
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
the people that are there are from out
 
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
of state they're from North Carolina
 
01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
Virginia and they come up there because
 
01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:35.480 align:start position:0%
you the little way income they can get
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
the training and he'd like to get more
 
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
people from here who he can take to the
 
01:08:42.749 --> 01:08:42.759 align:start position:0%
next level with the with the training
 
01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
that the ibw provides and stay here and
 
01:08:47.709 --> 01:08:47.719 align:start position:0%
work here and maybe come and fix those
 
01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
problems at my house and maybe yours but
 
01:08:51.789 --> 01:08:51.799 align:start position:0%
uh we're not getting enough people
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
interested in the trades uh they're
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
they're they're just not doing it so I I
 
01:08:59.430 --> 01:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
certainly uh can empathize with what uh
 
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
my colleague said about the the dir of
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
people going into being able to to fix
 
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
things and the need for able you know
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
construction we need to build housing
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
well you need all those trees people to
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
do it so I I don't want to discourage
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
union membership I want I don't want to
 
01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
I want to encourage people to work in
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
the trades and since the unions are are
 
01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
pretty busy training people uh and and
 
01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
make these making these careers
 
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
worthwhile through the union
 
01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
negotiations and the benefits the
 
01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
benefits that I think Mr love and I
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
agree people should pay for if they get
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
them uh then I'm going to I'm going to
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill as I've done every
 
01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
other I mean I'm I'm not now and have
 
01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
never been a union member but I would if
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
i' had the opportunity and uh there we
 
01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:48.759 align:start position:0%
are thank you representative uh
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
Kum thank you Mr
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
chair I don't disag agree with with the
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
comments made with regard to if you want
 
01:09:59.470 --> 01:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
to be part of a union you should pay the
 
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
dues um I'm not for getting free
 
01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
services in that
 
01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
aspect Still Remains a federal issue
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
that needs to be corrected and that's
 
01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
our job to go to the federal government
 
01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
this here often the comment is if you
 
01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to work there go if you don't
 
01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
want to be part of a union go find
 
01:10:24.189 --> 01:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
another job I spent 25 years of my
 
01:10:27.630 --> 01:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
career working for HVAC plumbers
 
01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
electricians Sheet Metal Workers Pipe
 
01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
Fitters all typically union jobs it's a
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
merit shop that we worked for and we had
 
01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
over 200 Tradesmen working in the field
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
and very often the union tried to come
 
01:10:44.189 --> 01:10:44.199 align:start position:0%
into our company they would send their
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
employees into our company and they
 
01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.070 align:start position:0%
employees into our company and they
would

01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:10:50.669 --> 01:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
salt and we had one time when we
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
actually had to deal with an
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
organization vote and everything else it
 
01:10:59.149 --> 01:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
didn't pass but going to this if you
 
01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to work for a union go find
 
01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
another job what happens in our case we
 
01:11:06.189 --> 01:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
were all very happy working for a merit
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
shop we were treated very well we were
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
able to speak for ourselves and
 
01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
negotiate our own pay rates we were
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
given great benefits um it was a
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
wonderful work environment with plenty
 
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
of training uh even a benefit of getting
 
01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
paid uh reimbursement for college so had
 
01:11:26.189 --> 01:11:26.199 align:start position:0%
we organized had that succeeded why
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
should I go look for another job I was
 
01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
happy where I was the union sent in the
 
01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
people to to send false advertising to
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
our employees about what they could get
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
at a union not necessarily what they
 
01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
were going to get so the rules changed
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
you know I didn't I shouldn't have had
 
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
to go look for another job I was happy
 
01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
the company was treating me well most of
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
our technicians felt the same I guess
 
01:11:52.629 --> 01:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
which is why it didn't pass so there's
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
another side to the T table and you know
 
01:11:57.629 --> 01:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
they looked at us because we had a large
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
base it would have been a great
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
membership ad to their Union I
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
understand that don't disagree but um at
 
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
that point in time if people wanted to
 
01:12:07.629 --> 01:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
join the union there were plenty of
 
01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
other Union companies that they could
 
01:12:11.629 --> 01:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
have gone to with their trades
 
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
so it's both sides I will be voting to
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
support this and um I believe
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly that
 
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
unions have a place with some people and
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
they definitely serve their purpose and
 
01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a one-size fits-all and people
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
should have a right to choose um The
 
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
Dilemma that we have with the way the
 
01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
federal government has written that law
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
is right now out of our hands but
 
01:12:45.149 --> 01:12:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
you I
 
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
um you there was plenty of uh comments
 
01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
made by many of the presenters
 
01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
that a number of people on this table
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
around this table asked for the for the
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
backup uh for the com you know for
 
01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
comments that were made that were not
 
01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
provided but uh I
 
01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
do think that the comments made by a
 
01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the presenters on both
 
01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
days were uh professional and courteous
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh to this committee and I applaud them
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
all uh for that I see no further hand uh
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
um Mr
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
J just for
 
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
clarification um under the under the
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
federal law uh the right to work which
 
01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
is uh under the tapped hotley law is is
 
01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
14b that was written in to give States
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
the authority to do this so when we say
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
it's a federal issue it's not a federal
 
01:13:49.629 --> 01:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
issue under the current tapal laws 14b
 
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
says that states can do this
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
individually and the other thing I I
 
01:13:58.990 --> 01:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
just if if this is a h word um nobody is
 
01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
forced to join a union in this country
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
nobody can be forced to join a union if
 
01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
you if there's a union shop and you want
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
to participate you can do that now the
 
01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
question here is about Union security
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
this is the union security agreements
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
which is the core of the right to work
 
01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
argument so whether or not you be can be
 
01:14:21.709 --> 01:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
uh whether or not they can negotiate
 
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
Provisions that require that you pay a
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
certain percentage and it's not dues
 
01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
it's a fee uh to support the activities
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
of the of the uh of the Union who is
 
01:14:37.229 --> 01:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
negotiating on your behalf but nobody
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
can be compelled nobody can be fired in
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
this country for not join the union that
 
01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
is a federal law and so I just want to
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that that we first of all
 
01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
understand this is State jurisdiction
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
14b gives the states the
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and uh and this is really
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
about Union security and finally nobody
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
can be forced to join any Union that
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
they they want to join no matter if if
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
the union is in place whatever the case
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
may be the only thing they can be can do
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
if it's negotiated and agreed to by both
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
the employer and the employees is to put
 
01:15:14.189 --> 01:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
a uh unit security agreement in which is
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
what this law would
 
01:15:19.629 --> 01:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
ban that's that's core of this uh of the
 
01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
right to work thank you Mr
 
01:15:23.790 --> 01:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
chairman all right I don't want to get
 
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
too out of control but representative
 
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
lir love kill keep to the point don't
 
01:15:31.830 --> 01:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
repeat things you've already said please
 
01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair I kind of after
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
listen to rep kokum I remember what I
 
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
was going to say
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
um she's absolutely right you know
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
companies do offer great benefits and
 
01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
and you you can definitely go work
 
01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
wherever you want I agree with that 100%
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
but again uh relevance of unions if they
 
01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
weren't around then companies would
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
have I guess or or employees would have
 
01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:58.350 align:start position:0%
have I guess or or employees would have
nothing

01:15:58.350 --> 01:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
to um to look at say for instance um if
 
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
the if the unions went around didn't
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
offer their benefits then I don't think
 
01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
anyone would and that's some of the
 
01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
protections because I've talked I was I
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
was uh for five years I was like rep uh
 
01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
McKenzie and I represented the
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
Carpenters Union 2,000 or so members in
 
01:16:21.189 --> 01:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I'd go to um open shop
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
carpenters and talk to them and say you
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
know they would tell me what they make
 
01:16:25.950 --> 01:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
what they what their benefits are Etc
 
01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
and I would tell them what mine were and
 
01:16:29.709 --> 01:16:29.719 align:start position:0%
what we had to offer well not mine our
 
01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
our unions and what we had to offer and
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
they would get excited and they would
 
01:16:35.669 --> 01:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
say yeah I'll I'll call you I'll be in
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
touch uh I would wait call them and then
 
01:16:40.149 --> 01:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
they say well we're all set and I said
 
01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
oh well good why is that well I told my
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
boss I was going to join the union they
 
01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
gave me raises and they gave me
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
benefits I don't think that would have
 
01:16:50.990 --> 01:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
happened had I not offered them that so
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
that that was just my only point thank
 
01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:56.600 align:start position:0%

Hill thank you Mr chair uh a couple
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
years ago when this bill came up I
 
01:17:42.669 --> 01:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
remember um somebody testifying from the
 
01:17:46.510 --> 01:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
well that uh union membership in non in
 
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
right to work states actually goes up 1%
 
01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
so the the idea that this hurts unions
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh I I fail to fail to see that um you
 
01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:57.450 align:start position:0%
know that's that's
 
01:17:57.450 --> 01:17:58.550 align:start position:0%

kahill thank you Mr chair you know
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
getting back to the agency fees which I
 
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
think we in agree with that people
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
should pay for what they get maybe not
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
pay the whole price because they don't
 
01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
want to join a union and and this does
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
seem to be something that's uh probably
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
as my my friend Mr McKenzie said a
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
agreed to uh for some reason that people
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
wanted it to be this way I I don't think
 
01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
we need to change that and I don't think
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
we need to change the law that would be
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:35.430 align:start position:0%

recognize to speak to your motion thank
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I'm supporting OTP because
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's not about benefits it's
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
not about getting the fancy pay scale
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
that supposedly you get when you're in a
 
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
union job I could do without the union
 
01:20:01.709 --> 01:20:01.719 align:start position:0%
Healthcare package I could do without
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
the pay I don't want any of it uh some
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
things are more important than pay and
 
01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
benefit packages and what's regardless
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
of how cushy it is what's more important
 
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
is my Liberty I need to be independent I
 
01:20:13.870 --> 01:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
need to be able to make my own choices I
 
01:20:15.390 --> 01:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
need to be able to negotiate my own
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
wages the unions have stolen that from
 
01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
me they have said that I am not allowed
 
01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
to negotiate my own wages and to your
 
01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
point I mentioned earlier that union
 
01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
membership is declining well what does
 
01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
that show you it's not it means that
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
people are choosing to isue unions and
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
so you might wonder what the relevance
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
of this is well it's about something
 
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
more important than the practicality or
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
how big of an impact is going to have
 
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's about the principle the fundamental
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
principle I should not be forced to pay
 
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
into a union that doesn't represent me
 
01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
and you say Well they're supposed to
 
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
represent you I don't think they do and
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
I'm the one who deter whether I think
 
01:20:55.149 --> 01:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
they represent me or not if they're not
 
01:20:56.590 --> 01:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
doing what I think that they should be
 
01:20:58.750 --> 01:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
doing I shouldn't be forced to pay into
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
them it's that simple the Cornerstone of
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
Liberty is the right to go to hack in
 
01:21:05.709 --> 01:21:05.719 align:start position:0%
your own hand basket you should be if
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
you don't like my choices if you think
 
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
they're bad choices great let me make
 
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
them I can make whatever bad choices you
 
01:21:15.629 --> 01:21:15.639 align:start position:0%
want whatever bad choices I want and uh
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
as far as independent workers go they're
 
01:21:19.629 --> 01:21:19.639 align:start position:0%
routine you say that unions are so great
 
01:21:21.149 --> 01:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
well then why are so many people
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
refusing to join unions if that's the
 
01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
case oh all 90% of workers are not in
 
01:21:29.229 --> 01:21:29.239 align:start position:0%
Union now it used to it used to be less
 
01:21:29.239 --> 01:21:31.870 align:start position:0%
Union now it used to it used to be less
than

01:21:31.870 --> 01:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
80% so and you say that uh this it was
 
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this is a issue with
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
federal law uh that we have these Free
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
Riders that aren't chipping in and uh
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
they need to have their wages garnished
 
01:21:45.149 --> 01:21:45.159 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of the unions well blame
 
01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
FDR I mean I'm a big fan of blaming FDR
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
for things just generally if you want to
 
01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
add this to the pile go ahead but uh
 
01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
don't call me a free rider and a scab
 
01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
when I want to go my own way when I
 
01:21:57.790 --> 01:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to do with the Union Sports
 
01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
and then don't make me pay for it don't
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
make me pay for the people that are
 
01:22:03.310 --> 01:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
stealing my funds who aren't
 
01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
representing me other people in here
 
01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
they seem to have been very happy
 
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
members of unions they seem to have
 
01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
liked it very much I a proud non-union
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
worker I have I was a union worker for
 
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
about one month and then I I bounced I
 
01:22:18.669 --> 01:22:18.679 align:start position:0%
was like I'm not going to do this
 
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
anymore and I come from a long line of
 
01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
people who have never been workers or if
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
they were union workers it was let for a
 
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
very short time and then they left all
 
01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
right and we're
 
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
growing so if you think the free riter
 
01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
should find other jobs they're they're
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
going to they're going to find other
 
01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
jobs I'm going to be supporting OTP on
 
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
this not because it makes a big impact
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
not because it matters because I don't
 
01:22:42.669 --> 01:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
think unions are going to exist 50 years
 
01:22:44.229 --> 01:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
from now I think they're going the way
 
01:22:45.709 --> 01:22:45.719 align:start position:0%
of the dodo on their own without our
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
assistance this isn't union busting this
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
is just about principle and the
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
principle of the matter is I should not
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
be forced to Chuck money towards people
 
01:22:55.709 --> 01:22:55.719 align:start position:0%
that don't that despise me let's be
 
01:22:58.189 --> 01:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
honest unions despise me why should I be
 
01:23:05.850 --> 01:23:05.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:09.110 align:start position:0%

McKenzie uh Mr chairman the um some of
 
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
the comments May be related to an
 
01:24:55.149 --> 01:24:55.159 align:start position:0%
amendment that has not been introduced
 
01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
to this committee as yet so I have the
 
01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:58.910 align:start position:0%
to this committee as yet so I have the
amendment

01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
drafted um and so I I wasn't able to
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
share it because they only to share it
 
01:25:06.189 --> 01:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
till comes in front of the committee so
 
01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
if they're going to opine about uh 1522
 
01:25:11.669 --> 01:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
the amendment 1522 maybe I should
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh hold that thought okay I heard what
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
you said Mr Vice chairman yeah a sponsor
 
01:25:31.390 --> 01:25:31.400 align:start position:0%
is free to share his Amendment at any
 
01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
time so we don't need to enter executive
 
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
the do you do you have physical copies
 
01:25:43.229 --> 01:25:43.239 align:start position:0%
of that yeah okay yes you feel free to
 
01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
to pass those around I think it's
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
important to ol said don't share them
 
01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
until the committee sees it so I haven't
 
01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
shared it with anybody okay feel free to
 
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:56.719 align:start position:0%
to share them with the committee sure
 
01:25:59.550 --> 01:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman point of clarification
 
01:26:01.709 --> 01:26:01.719 align:start position:0%
leave I believe what OLS said is that
 
01:26:03.109 --> 01:26:03.119 align:start position:0%
they they won't share them but the
 
01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
amendment sponsor is free to do what
 
01:26:08.109 --> 01:26:08.119 align:start position:0%

a senate proposal that is also being
 
01:28:00.189 --> 01:28:00.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh being amended uh from
 
01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Perkins quoka um she had given
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
us um permission to share that um with
 
01:28:10.189 --> 01:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
the labor committee uh so um I'll go
 
01:28:13.390 --> 01:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
through some highlights of each of them
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
um kind of running through the a similar
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
um methodology as we did before and then
 
01:28:23.070 --> 01:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
uh we have a few uh charts very few uh
 
01:28:25.390 --> 01:28:25.400 align:start position:0%
that just look at trust fund impact on
 
01:28:28.189 --> 01:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
the two amended proposals uh that folks
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
will recognize because you've you've
 
01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
seen these same charts and graphs with
 
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
the original proposal so I'll I'll
 
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
circulate these uh Mr got will be
 
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
talking to these and I'll give you some
 
01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
quick highlights on each of the amended
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
proposals so you can you know what we're
 
01:28:46.590 --> 01:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
here Mr
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I also have um
 
01:28:55.229 --> 01:28:55.239 align:start position:0%
if it's helpful for the committee um
 
01:28:56.669 --> 01:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
what I received from the Department
 
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
which breaks down the the uh the two
 
01:29:07.229 --> 01:29:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:09.709 --> 01:29:09.719 align:start position:0%
legislation yeah maybe it' be helpful if
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:20.669 --> 01:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
discussion should turn this on so these
 
01:29:23.229 --> 01:29:23.239 align:start position:0%
are printed copies of the email we got
 
01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:30.280 align:start position:0%
weekend there anybody that wants
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
them ahead all right um so I'll get
 
01:29:36.350 --> 01:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
started with the the amendment to House
 
01:29:39.709 --> 01:29:39.719 align:start position:0%
Bill 1522 from representative McKenzie
 
01:29:43.149 --> 01:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
um so what we're looking at here is um
 
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
The Proposal would increase 35 of the
 
01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
existing 52 benefit tiers as you recall
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
we have uh 50 2 um weekly benefit
 
01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
amounts currently in our statute for the
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
unemployment program and then uh so it
 
01:30:04.990 --> 01:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
increases 35 of those 52 uh it leaves
 
01:30:09.189 --> 01:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
the bottom 17 levels of benefits as they
 
01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
currently are and then it creates 19 new
 
01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:14.070 align:start position:0%
currently are and then it creates 19 new
benefit

01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:30:18.910 --> 01:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
tiers the wage replacement rate um would
 
01:30:23.550 --> 01:30:23.560 align:start position:0%
uh stay at 60% at the lower end of those
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
benefit tiers and then would um end at
 
01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:28.870 align:start position:0%
benefit tiers and then would um end at
around

01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
58% for the highend of the new tiers
 
01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
that are being proposed the new maximum
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount um is
 
01:30:42.750 --> 01:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
672 so our current maximum weekly
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
benefit amount that's been in place
 
01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.229 align:start position:0%
benefit amount that's been in place
since

01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
2007 is
 
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
427 so that new maximum amount of 672
 
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
two that would put New Hampshire as
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
having the 12th highest weekly Max in
 
01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
the country but as you recall um that
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
would still uh put us as having um one
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
of the lower weekly Maxes in the
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
Northeast uh so we'd still have the
 
01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
fourth lowest weekly Max in the
 
01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
Northeast um the proposal has a
 
01:31:18.910 --> 01:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
staggered implementation schedule um it
 
01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:22.719 align:start position:0%
would in introduce these new benefits TI
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
over 3 years so the full impact would be
 
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
would be phased in um we've focused on
 
01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
the fully implemented impact um but it
 
01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
is phased in so that the the
 
01:31:43.629 --> 01:31:43.639 align:start position:0%
ultimately the benefit increases would
 
01:31:43.639 --> 01:31:44.910 align:start position:0%
ultimately the benefit increases would
be

01:31:44.910 --> 01:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:31:50.109 --> 01:31:50.119 align:start position:0%
33% so a 33% increase in total benefit
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
payments over the base Baseline and that
 
01:31:55.790 --> 01:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
would get phased in so in the first year
 
01:31:59.830 --> 01:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
it'd be an 18% increase
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
and get this right and in the second
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
year it'd be a 27% increase and then in
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
that third year when you're fully
 
01:32:11.149 --> 01:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
implemented you're at
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
33% um to compare that to the original
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
proposal the original proposal was close
 
01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
to a 50% increase so this is
 
01:32:23.149 --> 01:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
significantly scaled back from that
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
original proposal um but the the fully
 
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
phased in cost would be a 33% increase
 
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:31.400 align:start position:0%
on Baseline
 
01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
benefits um shifting gears and looking
 
01:32:37.149 --> 01:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
at the proposal being considered in the
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
Senate and hitting those same items that
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
I just discussed for the amended house
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
proposal uh so the amended or soon to be
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
amended Senate proposal from Senator
 
01:32:51.870 --> 01:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
Perkins quoka um it does not touch the
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
current benefit schedule so our existing
 
01:32:58.350 --> 01:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
52 benefit tiers would remain the same
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
with the Senate
 
01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
proposal it creates 12 new benefit tiers
 
01:33:05.310 --> 01:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
that would be stacked on top of those
 
01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:07.229 align:start position:0%
that would be stacked on top of those
existing

01:33:07.229 --> 01:33:07.239 align:start position:0%
existing
 
01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
52 it would have a wage replacement rate
 
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
which is what we currently have of 60%
 
01:33:14.709 --> 01:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
in those lower
 
01:33:18.030 --> 01:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
tiers and then would top out at a
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
54% wage replacement rate at the new
 
01:33:22.709 --> 01:33:22.719 align:start position:0%
high High
 
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
tiers the new Max weekly benefit in the
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
Perkins quoka proposal would be 669 so
 
01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
$3 less than the house
 
01:33:35.229 --> 01:33:35.239 align:start position:0%
proposal um those rankings for
 
01:33:37.229 --> 01:33:37.239 align:start position:0%
nationally and in the Northeast would be
 
01:33:37.239 --> 01:33:39.149 align:start position:0%
nationally and in the Northeast would be
the

01:33:39.149 --> 01:33:39.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:42.109 --> 01:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
same the difference being that with the
 
01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
Senate proposal the 669 weekly benefit
 
01:33:48.669 --> 01:33:48.679 align:start position:0%
amount you would need to have earned
 
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
$65,000 in base period earnings uh
 
01:33:54.990 --> 01:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
rather than $60,000 in base period
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
proposal the uh total increase in costs
 
01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
with the Senate proposal is 26% over
 
01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
Baseline um it's not a staggered
 
01:34:13.629 --> 01:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
implementation so it would be uh
 
01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
realized in the first year of
 
01:34:19.870 --> 01:34:19.880 align:start position:0%
implementation so uh 26% with the Senate
 
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
amended proposal uh over Baseline the
 
01:34:27.669 --> 01:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
house amended proposal is a 33% increase
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
over Baseline um so we have also looked
 
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
at the um impacts on the trust fund
 
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
forecast and the two stress test
 
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
scenarios that we had discussed before
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
with a modest recession and a Severe
 
01:34:45.390 --> 01:34:45.400 align:start position:0%
recession and how the trust fund would
 
01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
perform um director gotab has conducted
 
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
both of those and the uh chart that we
 
01:34:53.669 --> 01:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
passed around summarize that and I'll
 
01:34:56.830 --> 01:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
let let him talk to those starting with
 
01:34:59.629 --> 01:34:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
1522 thank you um just to reiterate uh
 
01:35:04.990 --> 01:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
the methodology we use here is an
 
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
econometric model that uh does trust
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
fund forecasting um has a number of
 
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
inputs I won't go through all of that um
 
01:35:17.149 --> 01:35:17.159 align:start position:0%
but Rich pointed out the important
 
01:35:18.910 --> 01:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
aspect in the difference in this
 
01:35:21.070 --> 01:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
proposal the amended proposal is that it
 
01:35:24.030 --> 01:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
increas Ines benefit payments by 33%
 
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
based on actual claims from
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
2023 adjusting them to the new benefit
 
01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
schedule so 33% increase so we assume
 
01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
that there'd be a 33% increase in
 
01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
benefit payments um throughout the
 
01:35:40.030 --> 01:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
forecast period um taking a look at um
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
the charts the second chart that I show
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
is the impact on our current Baseline
 
01:35:47.550 --> 01:35:47.560 align:start position:0%
forecast for the trust fund which going
 
01:35:50.189 --> 01:35:50.199 align:start position:0%
out to Q4
 
01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
2025 is m m could you explain which
 
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
chart you're looking at there's a page
 
01:35:58.590 --> 01:35:58.600 align:start position:0%
number or show it there is no page
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
numbers on this it um they're both
 
01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
similar but this one is uh has House
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
Bill 1522 in the title at the
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
top so the the the first page shows a
 
01:36:16.990 --> 01:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
33% difference um the second page is the
 
01:36:19.870 --> 01:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
impact on our Baseline forecast our
 
01:36:22.350 --> 01:36:22.360 align:start position:0%
Baseline forecast being
 
01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:23.990 align:start position:0%
Baseline forecast being
$393

01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
$393
 
01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
million um with the new benefit schedule
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
we forecast that the trust fund would
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
end Q for 2025 at
 
01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:38.360 align:start position:0%
$352 million almost $353
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
million and this is a no a no recession
 
01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
scenario um some increase in claims and
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
unemployment claims uh as the economy
 
01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
might soften a little bit in in hiring
 
01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
the next chart is our begins our
 
01:36:55.870 --> 01:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
recession models um basically what we
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
did in the first one the modest
 
01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
recession we took the claim volume
 
01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
adjusted for the current number of
 
01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
employees in the state to a level that
 
01:37:07.709 --> 01:37:07.719 align:start position:0%
is equivalent to the modest relatively
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
modest recession we had in the early
 
01:37:14.229 --> 01:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
2000s so this is a a real life scenario
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
something that could actually occur and
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
what you see there is in that scenario
 
01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
our Baseline forecast would just to
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
$337 million so that's if there were no
 
01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
change in the benefit schedule if we
 
01:37:31.629 --> 01:37:31.639 align:start position:0%
change the benefit schedule to the point
 
01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:34.159 align:start position:0%
to the amended version then the trust
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
fund drops to$
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
265 million under this modest recession
 
01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
scenario so it's a difference of about
 
01:37:42.199 --> 01:37:45.390 align:start position:0%
scenario so it's a difference of about
$62

01:37:45.390 --> 01:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
million the final chart is our severe
 
01:37:50.350 --> 01:37:50.360 align:start position:0%
recession scenario and the severe
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
recession scenario scario is uh modeled
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
after the Great Recession Great
 
01:37:57.589 --> 01:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
Recession for those of you I think I
 
01:37:59.830 --> 01:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned this at the original hearing
 
01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:00.830 align:start position:0%
mentioned this at the original hearing
on

01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:38:03.790 --> 01:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
1522 um it took us six years almost to
 
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
get back all of the employment that we
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
lost during the Great Recession so
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
really significant um the trust fund
 
01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
actually did go negatively go negative
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
briefly requiring um the state uh to
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
borrow money from the federal government
 
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
um to to be able to pay the claims so a
 
01:38:25.390 --> 01:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
a severe situation in that very SE
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
severe recession scenario our Baseline
 
01:38:31.629 --> 01:38:31.639 align:start position:0%
would change without any adjustment to
 
01:38:34.189 --> 01:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
the benefit schedule would go down to
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
$162 million still at a level um given a
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
a severe recession um while it's a
 
01:38:44.830 --> 01:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
significant drop um we're not in danger
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
of going
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
negative um with the
 
01:38:52.109 --> 01:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
adjusted benefit schedule as proposed in
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
1522 the amended version um we forecast
 
01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
that the trust fund would drop to $106
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
million which is getting close to what
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
is considered uh a level of concern at a
 
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
at $100
 
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
million so about um a six $56 million
 
01:39:15.669 --> 01:39:15.679 align:start position:0%
difference taking a look quickly at um
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
01:39:21.589 --> 01:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
436 the primary difference in the for
 
01:39:25.229 --> 01:39:25.239 align:start position:0%
here is have you good I just ask you um
 
01:39:26.470 --> 01:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a question and he
 
01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
wants to have it before you get too deep
 
01:39:30.669 --> 01:39:30.679 align:start position:0%
into this apologize no it's all right
 
01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
trying to get through this quickly thank
 
01:39:35.070 --> 01:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr lers thank you Mr gly um we're
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
looking at the back page of the severe
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
recession one just before we get too far
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
um it was six years to replace the
 
01:39:44.030 --> 01:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
unemployment um workers how long did it
 
01:39:45.669 --> 01:39:45.679 align:start position:0%
take how long did it take us to replace
 
01:39:48.669 --> 01:39:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
balance you want to you
 
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
um well we in the actual Great Recession
 
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
so we ran out of money as director got
 
01:39:58.990 --> 01:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
pointed out so we we were in the whole
 
01:40:01.550 --> 01:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
120 million um they had to come back we
 
01:40:04.910 --> 01:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
had to pay that back to the US Treasury
 
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
um how quickly the the fund came back to
 
01:40:12.109 --> 01:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
that $250 250 million Mark where
 
01:40:15.189 --> 01:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
employers were again getting discounts I
 
01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
don't know the exact quarter off of off
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
of my head I can probably find it on our
 
01:40:21.589 --> 01:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
website right now as
 
01:40:23.709 --> 01:40:23.719 align:start position:0%
um director golob continues to talk and
 
01:40:26.109 --> 01:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
then I'll be able to provide that to you
 
01:40:28.669 --> 01:40:28.679 align:start position:0%
um when um when he's done with Senate
 
01:40:28.679 --> 01:40:30.669 align:start position:0%
um when um when he's done with Senate
Bill

01:40:30.669 --> 01:40:30.679 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:40:33.070 --> 01:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
436 thank you and then I have follow-ups
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
after that if that's okay yes and then
 
01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
kill after that
 
01:40:39.629 --> 01:40:39.639 align:start position:0%
goe representative kill thank you Mr
 
01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you gentlemen uh while
 
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
you're looking at that Mr labors would
 
01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
you tell us approximately how much money
 
01:40:48.790 --> 01:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
that cost the uh business owners in
 
01:40:53.070 --> 01:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
you're really trying to see if I can
 
01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
walk and chew gum at the same time well
 
01:40:58.589 --> 01:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
you can you know have a piece of gum and
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
then you thank you um so a just a
 
01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:06.159 align:start position:0%
reminder about how the uh discounts
 
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
themselves or fund balance reductions
 
01:41:11.070 --> 01:41:11.080 align:start position:0%
operate in the total cost to
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
employers so um as we've we've um talked
 
01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
about before so the discounts kick in
 
01:41:21.070 --> 01:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
for employers right now at uh 250
 
01:41:24.750 --> 01:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
million 350 million and 400 million so
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
when the trust fund achieves that
 
01:41:28.709 --> 01:41:28.719 align:start position:0%
balance for every day of a calendar
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
quarter employers then get a reduction
 
01:41:33.950 --> 01:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
in their earned rate the following
 
01:41:37.149 --> 01:41:37.159 align:start position:0%
quarter and at 250 million that
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
reduction that employers get is
 
01:41:44.030 --> 01:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
0.5% to their earned rate at 350 million
 
01:41:47.310 --> 01:41:47.320 align:start position:0%
it is uh 1% reduction to the earned rate
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
which is what they are receiving right
 
01:41:52.109 --> 01:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
now and that 400 100 million it is 1 and
 
01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:55.719 align:start position:0%
a half% reduction to their earned rate
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
um new employers start at a
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
2.7% rate that gets paid on the first
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
$114,000 in annual earnings per
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
employee the uh current uh reduction we
 
01:42:11.589 --> 01:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
have right now uh would take that new
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
employer from a 2.7% rate to a 1.7% rate
 
01:42:18.910 --> 01:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
so those um amounts of those reductions
 
01:42:21.390 --> 01:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
although they seem uh small uh when
 
01:42:22.709 --> 01:42:22.719 align:start position:0%
you're just talking about a half point
 
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
and a point um they are significant with
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
regard to uh the rates that employers
 
01:42:30.510 --> 01:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
pay employers right now are paying on
 
01:42:33.229 --> 01:42:33.239 align:start position:0%
average uh
 
01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
6% uh 6% rate uh that translates into
 
01:42:41.470 --> 01:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
about $80 per employee per year in
 
01:42:43.870 --> 01:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance taxes at the
 
01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
current rate with the 1% reduction that
 
01:42:49.470 --> 01:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
they're currently receiving
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
follow follow
 
01:42:55.950 --> 01:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr lab and so $80 a year for
 
01:42:58.030 --> 01:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
insurance you you couldn't insure a
 
01:43:00.589 --> 01:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
Chevy Vega for that could you and yet
 
01:43:03.589 --> 01:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
we're ensuring employers
 
01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
employment um my B my boss until
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
recently still had a Honda Prelude so I
 
01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
don't know what his insurance costs were
 
01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:21.149 --> 01:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
you all right Mr gole if you would Char
 
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
continue where you were okay we'll move
 
01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
on to Senate Bill
 
01:43:29.229 --> 01:43:29.239 align:start position:0%
436 and the primary difference in the
 
01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:32.360 align:start position:0%
forecast here um there is some
 
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
difference in the additional tiers that
 
01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
were added um a little bit difference
 
01:43:39.589 --> 01:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
but the main difference in it is that it
 
01:43:42.990 --> 01:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
does not adjust any of the benefit
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
schedule for the current um set of tiers
 
01:43:52.510 --> 01:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
so it only adds a set of tiers um and as
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
we talked about in the
 
01:43:58.109 --> 01:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
original uh 1522 testimony one of the
 
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
issues that contributes greatly or most
 
01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
significantly to our average weekly
 
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
benefit being low relative to other
 
01:44:10.589 --> 01:44:10.599 align:start position:0%
states is the fact that we have half of
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
the beneficiaries earning more than the
 
01:44:19.470 --> 01:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
maximum so the we pay benefits up to an
 
01:44:21.709 --> 01:44:21.719 align:start position:0%
individual that makes 4
 
01:44:24.750 --> 01:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
$1,500 currently so anything above that
 
01:44:26.910 --> 01:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
the benefit does not increase when we
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
look at the actual claims more than half
 
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
of our claimants have earned earnings
 
01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
that are higher than that so that
 
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
depresses the average weekly benefit so
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's the primary difference so this
 
01:44:43.149 --> 01:44:43.159 align:start position:0%
bill Senate Bill 436 would increase
 
01:44:46.990 --> 01:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
benefit payments by 26% as opposed to
 
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
33% in the U amended 1522 to that's the
 
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
first page the second page looks at a
 
01:44:59.149 --> 01:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
back cast so um if you recall back we
 
01:45:01.149 --> 01:45:01.159 align:start position:0%
back casted
 
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
1522 in our last testimony I won't get
 
01:45:05.589 --> 01:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
into that but we looked at what would
 
01:45:05.599 --> 01:45:06.350 align:start position:0%
into that but we looked at what would
have

01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
happened taking the actual claims volume
 
01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
from the previous two years and what
 
01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:16.719 align:start position:0%
would have this proposed benefit
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
schedule 436 result in it would have
 
01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:21.109 align:start position:0%
schedule 436 result in it would have
lowered

01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
lowered
 
01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
um the current trust fund balance by
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
about $32 million so going from 392 or
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
393 to
 
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
360 that's the first chart the second
 
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
chart looks at what the impact is on our
 
01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
forecast our Baseline forecast we
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
generally try to forecast about two
 
01:45:42.990 --> 01:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
years out one year we're very confident
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
in second year is a little bit more
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
difficult because economic conditions
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
can be difficult to project that far out
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
but um taking the new proposed benefit
 
01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
schedule in 40 uh Center Bill 436 um we
 
01:45:59.950 --> 01:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
forecast about a $29 million impact on
 
01:46:03.629 --> 01:46:03.639 align:start position:0%
the current our current forecast so what
 
01:46:06.030 --> 01:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
I would say is that while our forecast
 
01:46:08.589 --> 01:46:08.599 align:start position:0%
may not be completely accurate at the
 
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
end of 2025 the real importance of doing
 
01:46:15.070 --> 01:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
this kind of modeling is to look at what
 
01:46:17.229 --> 01:46:17.239 align:start position:0%
the differential is to in whatever
 
01:46:19.470 --> 01:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
forecast we come up with and whatever
 
01:46:22.030 --> 01:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
the new benefits schedule is that's the
 
01:46:24.589 --> 01:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
real value of it so we may not be right
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
on in our forecast but look at the
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
differential that's the key metric that
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
you want to look at so about a $29
 
01:46:32.430 --> 01:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
million difference in the current
 
01:46:35.229 --> 01:46:35.239 align:start position:0%
Baseline forecast taking a look at we
 
01:46:37.589 --> 01:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
did the same thing we modeled it under a
 
01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
modest recession similar to the early
 
01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:41.310 align:start position:0%
modest recession similar to the early
2000

01:46:41.310 --> 01:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
2000
 
01:46:44.589 --> 01:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
recession and in that situation again
 
01:46:47.310 --> 01:46:47.320 align:start position:0%
Baseline forecast would be adjusted with
 
01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
no change in any benefit schedule would
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
be down to about 300 $137 million that's
 
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
the same as in
 
01:46:57.310 --> 01:46:57.320 align:start position:0%
1522 this particular proposal um would
 
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
have a little bit less of an impact um
 
01:47:04.910 --> 01:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
it would result in uh a forecast of $286
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
million uh about a $51 million
 
01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
difference between the Baseline and um
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
the proposed uh in the proposed benefit
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:21.910 --> 01:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
436 last
 
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
chart is the severe recession
 
01:47:29.589 --> 01:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
scenario um and in that scenario again
 
01:47:31.589 --> 01:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
obviously trust fund takes a very big
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
hit down to 162 million in our Baseline
 
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
forecast this proposal would bring it up
 
01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:40.639 align:start position:0%
um would reduce that by an additional
 
01:47:44.589 --> 01:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
$48 million to around $114
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
million so a bit better than what would
 
01:47:52.149 --> 01:47:52.159 align:start position:0%
happen under 15 20 to um but still would
 
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
have a significant impact on the on the
 
01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
trust fund again we're getting bit
 
01:48:00.229 --> 01:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
dangerously down below or near that $100
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
million that begins to make uh people
 
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
who watch this closely very
 
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
nervous stop um and just one thing to
 
01:48:11.149 --> 01:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
add to answer representative avani's
 
01:48:14.709 --> 01:48:14.719 align:start position:0%
question so uh the trust fund uh reached
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
and maintained 250 million in the third
 
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
quarter of 2014
 
01:48:24.189 --> 01:48:24.199 align:start position:0%
uh coming out of the Great Recession and
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
it U that following quarter employers
 
01:48:30.990 --> 01:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
received a half Point reduction then
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
quarter after that it went up to a full
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
point reduction it did kind of kangaroo
 
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
around a little bit uh for a few
 
01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
quarters and eventually employers were
 
01:48:41.790 --> 01:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
were back to getting a 1 and a half%
 
01:48:45.629 --> 01:48:45.639 align:start position:0%
reduction um up until uh the timing of
 
01:48:45.639 --> 01:48:46.510 align:start position:0%
reduction um up until uh the timing of
the

01:48:46.510 --> 01:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic so it was third quarter of 14
 
01:48:55.790 --> 01:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:59.310 --> 01:48:59.320 align:start position:0%
million was that from 2001 or from 2008
 
01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
that was from the Great Recession so
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
200891 recession thank
 
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
questions all right well
 
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
shoot keep it sin synct please thank you
 
01:49:17.589 --> 01:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um given the fact that it
 
01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:24.750 --> 01:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
250 million and now right now we're at
 
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
$400 million do you see through your
 
01:49:28.950 --> 01:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
claims benefits and the durations that
 
01:49:31.790 --> 01:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
you did for these that people would stay
 
01:49:34.669 --> 01:49:34.679 align:start position:0%
on these benefits longer with a larger
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
payout even a week or two weeks given
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
longer or and have did you factor in any
 
01:49:42.589 --> 01:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
I want to say cushion but for that for
 
01:49:44.229 --> 01:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
the duration of benefits to last a
 
01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
little bit longer than the 449 that we
 
01:49:48.189 --> 01:49:48.199 align:start position:0%
currently have in what we're looking at
 
01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
right now and then I'll wait for the
 
01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:51.800 align:start position:0%
next question
 
01:49:53.709 --> 01:49:53.719 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important to point out
 
01:49:55.070 --> 01:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
anytime you get into an economic
 
01:49:57.709 --> 01:49:57.719 align:start position:0%
downturn your duration increases um you
 
01:50:01.470 --> 01:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
know that's just the factual experience
 
01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
that we've had with every downturn um
 
01:50:05.629 --> 01:50:05.639 align:start position:0%
right now duration in New Hampshire one
 
01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
of the lowest in the country lowest in
 
01:50:11.390 --> 01:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
the Northeast we're at about 10 weeks um
 
01:50:14.109 --> 01:50:14.119 align:start position:0%
what you see with the the two
 
01:50:18.750 --> 01:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
proposals um is with the uh house
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
proposal your
 
01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:23.560 align:start position:0%
wage replacement rate so the the the
 
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
amount of what your benefits represent
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
as a percentage of the wages that you
 
01:50:31.149 --> 01:50:31.159 align:start position:0%
had while you were working um is
 
01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
slightly higher than that under the
 
01:50:36.430 --> 01:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
Senate proposal so the Senate proposal
 
01:50:39.589 --> 01:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything to the benefit tiers
 
01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
that exist now so right now if you're
 
01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:44.709 align:start position:0%
that exist now so right now if you're
earning

01:50:44.709 --> 01:50:44.719 align:start position:0%
earning
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
$41,500 in your base period you get
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
$427 that's what you would get in in the
 
01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
Senate proposal it's about a 54% wage
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
replacement rate the Senate proposal
 
01:50:58.350 --> 01:50:58.360 align:start position:0%
brings those base period earnings up to
 
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
65,000 so that person would then get um
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
669 as a as a weekly benefit amount
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:51:10.910 --> 01:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
54% um at that maintaining that wage
 
01:51:15.229 --> 01:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
replacement rate in a status quo type of
 
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
economy is what we have right now um I
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't expect to see a shift in
 
01:51:22.350 --> 01:51:22.360 align:start position:0%
Behavior as your wage replacement rate
 
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
isn't uh changing at all if you get into
 
01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:26.109 align:start position:0%
isn't uh changing at all if you get into
a

01:51:26.109 --> 01:51:26.119 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:51:29.069 --> 01:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
downturn um duration will increase that
 
01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
will increase regardless of what you do
 
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh to the benefit structure the house
 
01:51:36.669 --> 01:51:36.679 align:start position:0%
proposal is a is slightly above that on
 
01:51:38.430 --> 01:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
the wage replacement rate as I had
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
indicated it does it keeps the the
 
01:51:45.310 --> 01:51:45.320 align:start position:0%
bottom 17 tiers as they are right now um
 
01:51:48.750 --> 01:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
and then the 35 tiers above that um
 
01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
moves them up slightly
 
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
and then um what you see in the 19 new
 
01:51:56.910 --> 01:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
tiers proposed with the new maximum
 
01:51:59.910 --> 01:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
benefit of 672 your wage replacement
 
01:52:03.390 --> 01:52:03.400 align:start position:0%
rate is in the higher uh 50% range so
 
01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
the 58% range so slightly higher wage
 
01:52:09.550 --> 01:52:09.560 align:start position:0%
replacement rate uh than individuals
 
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
have right now at that Max weekly
 
01:52:14.750 --> 01:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
benefit amount whether or not going from
 
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
a a 54% to a 58 is enough to shift
 
01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:20.470 align:start position:0%
a a 54% to a 58 is enough to shift
Behavior

01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
Behavior
 
01:52:25.069 --> 01:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
and have an influence on duration um I'm
 
01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
can't say precisely whether that would
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
have any impact or not I do have an
 
01:52:31.550 --> 01:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
economist next to me if he wants to
 
01:52:34.629 --> 01:52:34.639 align:start position:0%
suggest anything there I do and and this
 
01:52:36.350 --> 01:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
is not an ideological statement
 
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
whatsoever but there's plenty of
 
01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
economic research on on on behavioral
 
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
patterns related to unemployment
 
01:52:45.430 --> 01:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
benefits and as the replacement ratio
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
increases significantly it does tend to
 
01:52:51.149 --> 01:52:51.159 align:start position:0%
lengthen the duration of uh uh of
 
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
individuals on on benefits and we see
 
01:52:55.350 --> 01:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
that in some of our neighboring states
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has very high um benefit
 
01:53:00.990 --> 01:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh payments compared to New Hampshire
 
01:53:03.790 --> 01:53:03.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a dramatically different
 
01:53:06.910 --> 01:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
economy and yet their duration there is
 
01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
is significantly longer than is the
 
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
duration in New Hampshire so it's it's
 
01:53:14.229 --> 01:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
just basic economics it does create
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
different incentives it's not again not
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
an ideological
 
01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:20.350 align:start position:0%
an ideological
statement

01:53:20.350 --> 01:53:20.360 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:53:23.149 --> 01:53:23.159 align:start position:0%
can you follow up please go ahead um is
 
01:53:26.109 --> 01:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
that for is so say it's a 10% increase
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
in you in benefit duration is that in
 
01:53:30.910 --> 01:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
this because I'm looking at the trust
 
01:53:32.069 --> 01:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
fund and the cost it's going to be to
 
01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
employeers to implement these
 
01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
changes strictly that's all will is it
 
01:53:41.430 --> 01:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
has it been forecasted in under the 2001
 
01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
to 2008 and have you look even looked at
 
01:53:46.109 --> 01:53:46.119 align:start position:0%
the covid issue if we have that again
 
01:53:48.350 --> 01:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
coming up of of of a
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
different iteration
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
to have that
 
01:53:56.149 --> 01:53:56.159 align:start position:0%
initial bom to the trust fund and a
 
01:53:58.350 --> 01:53:58.360 align:start position:0%
Severe decrease and how would employers
 
01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
or even even the agency if it was in the
 
01:54:03.790 --> 01:54:03.800 align:start position:0%
second or third quarter come to build
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
that trust fund back up quickly so we're
 
01:54:08.990 --> 01:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
not in the
 
01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
negative I'll let the first part of that
 
01:54:13.870 --> 01:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
question I believe is just about the
 
01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
methodology if you want to address that
 
01:54:18.430 --> 01:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
with the The increased duration yeah the
 
01:54:21.149 --> 01:54:21.159 align:start position:0%
the we don't have in the model a
 
01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
specific uh duration benef um variable
 
01:54:27.069 --> 01:54:27.079 align:start position:0%
that we can increase so it's not
 
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
included however and I struggled to how
 
01:54:33.990 --> 01:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
to explain this it's a a statistical
 
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
model that when claims are more severe
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
um the model knows that benefit payments
 
01:54:45.149 --> 01:54:45.159 align:start position:0%
are going to go up kind of
 
01:54:46.990 --> 01:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
disproportionately based on that volume
 
01:54:49.470 --> 01:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
of claims not just the dollar but um so
 
01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
it indirectly factors in the um the
 
01:54:56.109 --> 01:54:56.119 align:start position:0%
impact of duration um this the model is
 
01:54:58.870 --> 01:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
based on 20 more than 20 years worth of
 
01:55:01.510 --> 01:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
data and how the the payments or the
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
trust fund reacts to the different
 
01:55:05.950 --> 01:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
levels of claims we do not have the
 
01:55:08.229 --> 01:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
pandemic in the model the pandemic was
 
01:55:10.709 --> 01:55:10.719 align:start position:0%
not used to as for because it was an
 
01:55:14.189 --> 01:55:14.199 align:start position:0%
anomalous situation it um you know much
 
01:55:16.990 --> 01:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
of the unemployment was benefits were
 
01:55:18.990 --> 01:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
paid by the federal government so it
 
01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
didn't have a direct impact on the trust
 
01:55:25.189 --> 01:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
fund so the pandemic experience is from
 
01:55:27.189 --> 01:55:27.199 align:start position:0%
as an economist and statistician
 
01:55:30.189 --> 01:55:30.199 align:start position:0%
perspective screwed up every time series
 
01:55:33.030 --> 01:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
because it was so unique it messed up
 
01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
everything so it's not included in that
 
01:55:38.109 --> 01:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
situation and if it were to reoccur we
 
01:55:40.669 --> 01:55:40.679 align:start position:0%
would have to you know wonder whether
 
01:55:42.149 --> 01:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
the federal government would step in
 
01:55:45.229 --> 01:55:45.239 align:start position:0%
again start paying many of the benefits
 
01:55:49.189 --> 01:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
that the entire um eligibility changed
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
people who had never been eligible for
 
01:55:53.550 --> 01:55:53.560 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits prior to that
 
01:55:56.750 --> 01:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic were all of a sudden um uh
 
01:55:58.709 --> 01:55:58.719 align:start position:0%
eligible so we really couldn't include
 
01:56:01.069 --> 01:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
it in the in the
 
01:56:03.709 --> 01:56:03.719 align:start position:0%
modeling um the the second part of that
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
question how would the the department
 
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
handle it if you know looking at a a
 
01:56:12.069 --> 01:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
regular um plain old downturn like we've
 
01:56:15.750 --> 01:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
experienced before um so the current
 
01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
tools that are in place right now to to
 
01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
control for that because the the trust
 
01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:22.719 align:start position:0%
fund and I've said this before it's
 
01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
you're you're kind of looking for that
 
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
Johnny Cash moment right you kind of
 
01:56:30.109 --> 01:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
want that uh that last check to bounce
 
01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
the trust fund isn't all that uh
 
01:56:34.350 --> 01:56:34.360 align:start position:0%
different than that you don't want to
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
over tax employers um to create a
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
balance that is more than you're going
 
01:56:41.790 --> 01:56:41.800 align:start position:0%
to need to support unemployed workers in
 
01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
your next downturn because if you're
 
01:56:46.750 --> 01:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
creating a higher business climate a
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
higher tax climate that is directly tied
 
01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
to the number of workers they have
 
01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
employers will hire fewer workers so
 
01:56:59.430 --> 01:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a um a balance that you try
 
01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
to um meet where you're not over taxing
 
01:57:05.189 --> 01:57:05.199 align:start position:0%
your employers um and not building your
 
01:57:08.229 --> 01:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
fund to excess um but you're going to
 
01:57:10.470 --> 01:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
have enough to withstand that next
 
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
downturn so that the state is able to
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
pay benefits not have to depend upon the
 
01:57:18.069 --> 01:57:18.079 align:start position:0%
federal government um and borrow dollars
 
01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
that could end up being very expensive
 
01:57:22.629 --> 01:57:22.639 align:start position:0%
dollars for the Employers in that state
 
01:57:24.629 --> 01:57:24.639 align:start position:0%
so what would happen is if we get into a
 
01:57:28.069 --> 01:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
downturn um the very first thing that
 
01:57:30.990 --> 01:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
would be happening um is that employers
 
01:57:33.189 --> 01:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
would be losing those those fund balance
 
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
reductions um they would be coming off
 
01:57:38.910 --> 01:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
as the uh balance of the trust fund is
 
01:57:41.310 --> 01:57:41.320 align:start position:0%
falling uh that would then increase
 
01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
their rates um and increase the amount
 
01:57:46.390 --> 01:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
of taxes that they're paying it could
 
01:57:48.669 --> 01:57:48.679 align:start position:0%
have a small impact depending on the
 
01:57:50.069 --> 01:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
time of the year
 
01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:52.719 align:start position:0%
that that is hitting so if an employer
 
01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a seasonal flavor to their
 
01:57:57.629 --> 01:57:57.639 align:start position:0%
employment pattern um and you're in the
 
01:57:59.790 --> 01:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
third quarter when those when those fund
 
01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
balance reductions are coming off that
 
01:58:03.149 --> 01:58:03.159 align:start position:0%
might not have an impact on that
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
employer until you get to the first
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
quarter of the following year because
 
01:58:10.390 --> 01:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
they've paid um the taxes on the first
 
01:58:12.629 --> 01:58:12.639 align:start position:0%
$14,000 in annual earnings for the
 
01:58:16.470 --> 01:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
employees for that existing year now
 
01:58:18.350 --> 01:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
what happens with the earned rate that
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
gets adjusted on an annual basis uh in
 
01:58:24.910 --> 01:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
each August employers get a tax rate
 
01:58:26.629 --> 01:58:26.639 align:start position:0%
redetermination package from the
 
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
Department which takes into
 
01:58:30.350 --> 01:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
consideration all of their experience so
 
01:58:31.790 --> 01:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
all the benefits paid out to their
 
01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
former employees all the taxes paid in
 
01:58:36.270 --> 01:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
by that employer and it provides them
 
01:58:38.550 --> 01:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
with their rate for the four quarters
 
01:58:41.910 --> 01:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
going forward um that would also be
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
adjusted based upon higher benefit
 
01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:48.639 align:start position:0%
payments going out um and um uh would be
 
01:58:51.149 --> 01:58:51.159 align:start position:0%
adjusted to all of those factors so one
 
01:58:53.229 --> 01:58:53.239 align:start position:0%
would assume their rate their experience
 
01:58:57.550 --> 01:58:57.560 align:start position:0%
rate would be higher as well um you
 
01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
could look at the when we go back and we
 
01:59:02.950 --> 01:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
look at that average tax rate chart that
 
01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
we had provided in the original
 
01:59:06.870 --> 01:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
presentation employers currently are
 
01:59:09.310 --> 01:59:09.320 align:start position:0%
paying at an average of
 
01:59:11.669 --> 01:59:11.679 align:start position:0%
6% um when you look at what they are
 
01:59:15.629 --> 01:59:15.639 align:start position:0%
paying at the uh peak of the uh pandemic
 
01:59:17.390 --> 01:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
they are about 2 and a
 
01:59:21.790 --> 01:59:21.800 align:start position:0%
half% so what that represents is about a
 
01:59:24.229 --> 01:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
1 and 12% loss of their fund balance
 
01:59:26.669 --> 01:59:26.679 align:start position:0%
reduction together with uh some
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
worsening of experience and so quickly
 
01:59:33.510 --> 01:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh the rate you can go back up to that
 
01:59:35.830 --> 01:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh 2 and a half% range but th those are
 
01:59:39.069 --> 01:59:39.079 align:start position:0%
the levers that um are in are in place
 
01:59:41.470 --> 01:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
right now uh new New Hampshire no longer
 
01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
has sear charges in place that would be
 
01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
added on to an employer's tax rate when
 
01:59:49.790 --> 01:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
the fund drops um the uh
 
01:59:51.870 --> 01:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
idea was that allow the fund to grow to
 
01:59:54.550 --> 01:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
a higher balance during economic good
 
01:59:57.310 --> 01:59:57.320 align:start position:0%
times like we're currently experiencing
 
02:00:00.109 --> 02:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
with a fund that is close to 400 million
 
02:00:01.709 --> 02:00:01.719 align:start position:0%
rather than where it would have been if
 
02:00:03.589 --> 02:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
we hadn't made those adjustments we'd be
 
02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
looking at a fund at around 300 million
 
02:00:08.430 --> 02:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
right now um but allow the fund to grow
 
02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
to a higher amount a true solvent amount
 
02:00:13.709 --> 02:00:13.719 align:start position:0%
and that way you don't need to provide a
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
sir charge onto employers when times are
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
not so good so right now it' be the loss
 
02:00:21.069 --> 02:00:21.079 align:start position:0%
of those fund balance reductions a
 
02:00:22.990 --> 02:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
worsening of experience so when they got
 
02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
their annual redetermination uh the the
 
02:00:28.030 --> 02:00:28.040 align:start position:0%
rate the earned rate would be higher as
 
02:00:30.390 --> 02:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
well that would try to drive in more
 
02:00:33.950 --> 02:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue into the fund to try to keep up
 
02:00:36.990 --> 02:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
um with those increases in dispersements
 
02:00:39.709 --> 02:00:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:43.350 --> 02:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
fund who Grangers first s right and then
 
02:00:46.669 --> 02:00:46.679 align:start position:0%
represent uh thank you this might be a a
 
02:00:49.310 --> 02:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
question for either you guys or the
 
02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
chair um so this is referencing SB 436
 
02:00:57.069 --> 02:00:57.079 align:start position:0%
as amended um but I looked up on I you
 
02:00:58.149 --> 02:00:58.159 align:start position:0%
know where I could get that Amendment
 
02:01:01.109 --> 02:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
because it's not on gen Court I guess um
 
02:01:03.550 --> 02:01:03.560 align:start position:0%
I believe Senator Perkins quoka will be
 
02:01:06.030 --> 02:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
providing it to the committee um she had
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
shared it um uh with the department and
 
02:01:11.550 --> 02:01:11.560 align:start position:0%
had given the department permission to
 
02:01:13.470 --> 02:01:13.480 align:start position:0%
share it with the labor committee as
 
02:01:16.510 --> 02:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
well okay thank you so I can I can
 
02:01:19.149 --> 02:01:19.159 align:start position:0%
actually provide uh that to uh chairman
 
02:01:21.189 --> 02:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
infantine to provide out to the
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much that would
 
02:01:25.069 --> 02:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
be wonderful
 
02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
PR uh thank you um my question is
 
02:01:30.310 --> 02:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
regarding the um Behavior change you
 
02:01:32.830 --> 02:01:32.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned regarding the average weeks of
 
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
unemployment usage as a line to the
 
02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
maximum benefit amount um do you see
 
02:01:40.390 --> 02:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
that having a greater effect in good
 
02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
times than in a recession time simply
 
02:01:45.430 --> 02:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
because it intuitively it seems in uh
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
either a moderate or severe recession
 
02:01:48.709 --> 02:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
everyone goes to the maximum many ways
 
02:01:50.430 --> 02:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
cuz they have having trouble and so I
 
02:01:52.629 --> 02:01:52.639 align:start position:0%
would actually more see that change in
 
02:01:54.669 --> 02:01:54.679 align:start position:0%
Behavior affecting the previous forecast
 
02:01:57.229 --> 02:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
on the previous page of during normal
 
02:01:58.589 --> 02:01:58.599 align:start position:0%
times like we are now and actually
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
moving the lines downward there more
 
02:02:03.750 --> 02:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
than in the recession forecast and also
 
02:02:05.870 --> 02:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
affecting the fund balance accordingly
 
02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
can you comment on that at all no I I
 
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
think that's um an excellent point um
 
02:02:13.350 --> 02:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
you know duration is going to lengthen
 
02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
in the sever with the severity of the
 
02:02:19.109 --> 02:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
recession regardless so um you know to
 
02:02:21.709 --> 02:02:21.719 align:start position:0%
the extent that it Alters incentives to
 
02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
to stay on unemployment longer it's
 
02:02:27.229 --> 02:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
going to do so in a situation where
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
there is actually the choice to become
 
02:02:32.069 --> 02:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
re-employ to work harder to become
 
02:02:35.069 --> 02:02:35.079 align:start position:0%
reemployed or not that's more likely to
 
02:02:38.149 --> 02:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
be a situation in a very mild or a more
 
02:02:41.189 --> 02:02:41.199 align:start position:0%
mild recession or a normal economy when
 
02:02:43.390 --> 02:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
because invariably people do get laid
 
02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
off even in a non-recessionary economy
 
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
so it would probably impact that behav
 
02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
behavioral those behavioral situations
 
02:02:56.910 --> 02:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
in situations Le more so in the stronger
 
02:02:59.550 --> 02:02:59.560 align:start position:0%
economy or a less severe recession in
 
02:03:01.669 --> 02:03:01.679 align:start position:0%
the severe recession it probably doesn't
 
02:03:03.629 --> 02:03:03.639 align:start position:0%
have as much of an impact and I think to
 
02:03:05.310 --> 02:03:05.320 align:start position:0%
some degree that is reflected in these
 
02:03:07.510 --> 02:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
forecasts where you know the difference
 
02:03:10.430 --> 02:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
between the Baseline and the severe
 
02:03:13.109 --> 02:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to you know decrease
 
02:03:15.189 --> 02:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
proportionately with the severity of the
 
02:03:16.990 --> 02:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
recession so I think there is some of
 
02:03:19.709 --> 02:03:19.719 align:start position:0%
that being captured in the model
 
02:03:21.629 --> 02:03:21.639 align:start position:0%
thank you and just something to add
 
02:03:23.149 --> 02:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
there there you know there's a lot of
 
02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
talk coming out of the pandemic about
 
02:03:28.510 --> 02:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
people making more on Unemployment uh
 
02:03:30.550 --> 02:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
than they did in work which was a
 
02:03:34.669 --> 02:03:34.679 align:start position:0%
function of how um the federal program
 
02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
was created that paid unemployment
 
02:03:39.390 --> 02:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
benefits uh during the pandemic with
 
02:03:42.030 --> 02:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
initially an ex an additional $600 a
 
02:03:44.950 --> 02:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
week and then an additional $300 a week
 
02:03:46.589 --> 02:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
but for what we're talking about here
 
02:03:49.189 --> 02:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
that's not that scenario at all here
 
02:03:52.109 --> 02:03:52.119 align:start position:0%
we're talking about just state benefits
 
02:03:55.229 --> 02:03:55.239 align:start position:0%
um with the two amendments you have uh
 
02:03:57.629 --> 02:03:57.639 align:start position:0%
you know that person getting that Max
 
02:04:00.189 --> 02:04:00.199 align:start position:0%
benefit you're either at a 54% wage
 
02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
replacement with the Senate proposal or
 
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
a 58% wage replacement in the house
 
02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
proposal you're not getting rich in
 
02:04:11.430 --> 02:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
either of those scenarios and I think um
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
there's still quite a bit of incentive
 
02:04:15.709 --> 02:04:15.719 align:start position:0%
for you to be returning to employment
 
02:04:17.430 --> 02:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
when your when your wage replacement
 
02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
rate um is just a a a little bit above
 
02:04:22.589 --> 02:04:22.599 align:start position:0%
50% of what you were making while you
 
02:04:22.599 --> 02:04:26.510 align:start position:0%
50% of what you were making while you
were

02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
employed representative kill thank you
 
02:04:32.109 --> 02:04:32.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you gentleman again uh I
 
02:04:34.270 --> 02:04:34.280 align:start position:0%
know that these uh discounts are very
 
02:04:36.229 --> 02:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
important because as I recall we were
 
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
talking about Federal money and I know
 
02:04:40.430 --> 02:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
the governor took 15 million in arpa
 
02:04:42.709 --> 02:04:42.719 align:start position:0%
money and applied that to the
 
02:04:45.549 --> 02:04:45.559 align:start position:0%
unemployment trust fund to hasten those
 
02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh half% reductions for the community so
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
so I know we think about the those
 
02:04:52.549 --> 02:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
reductions being important and and
 
02:04:55.510 --> 02:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
changing employer Behavior Uh and we
 
02:04:58.910 --> 02:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
also talk about the uh increase in the
 
02:05:01.790 --> 02:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
benefit changing um employee Behavior
 
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
will they be looking for work if they
 
02:05:06.270 --> 02:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
have a little bit more money in their
 
02:05:10.030 --> 02:05:10.040 align:start position:0%
pocket uh to spend on paying their bills
 
02:05:11.870 --> 02:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh buying things in their Community
 
02:05:14.790 --> 02:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
paying their taxes whatever uh so is is
 
02:05:17.589 --> 02:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
it fair to say that uh this is a modest
 
02:05:19.510 --> 02:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
Improvement that is really
 
02:05:21.149 --> 02:05:21.159 align:start position:0%
uh either way with the senate or the
 
02:05:22.750 --> 02:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
house bill that it's kind it's kind of
 
02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
time we should do this so that people
 
02:05:27.470 --> 02:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
are not going to be scraping by but
 
02:05:29.830 --> 02:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit more comfortable as
 
02:05:33.510 --> 02:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
they seek the to to replace the entire
 
02:05:36.069 --> 02:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
uh paycheck they were
 
02:05:39.189 --> 02:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
getting um well you know we'll leave it
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
up to to you folks whether or not it's
 
02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
time uh to do this what I can tell you
 
02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:44.870 align:start position:0%
time uh to do this what I can tell you
is

02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
that looking at these proposals with the
 
02:05:51.470 --> 02:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
the benefit tiers that that are
 
02:05:53.470 --> 02:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
contained within each of them they don't
 
02:05:55.830 --> 02:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
raise any alarms with the wage
 
02:05:58.390 --> 02:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
replacement rates uh that are being
 
02:06:01.549 --> 02:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
proposed um you know the the I think the
 
02:06:03.629 --> 02:06:03.639 align:start position:0%
original wage replacement rates in in
 
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1522 the original proposal I
 
02:06:13.790 --> 02:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
think um uh were higher um than um uh
 
02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
you would normally see uh within an
 
02:06:19.229 --> 02:06:19.239 align:start position:0%
unemployment program that's properly
 
02:06:21.629 --> 02:06:21.639 align:start position:0%
structured to incentivize a return to
 
02:06:24.189 --> 02:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
employment um but you know both
 
02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
proposals that we're looking at now with
 
02:06:29.629 --> 02:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
wage replacement rates um in the 50s you
 
02:06:31.149 --> 02:06:31.159 align:start position:0%
know that the Senate proposal in the
 
02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
lower 50s the house proposal in the
 
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
higher 50s um neither of those raise any
 
02:06:39.950 --> 02:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
alarms thank you one comment I I think
 
02:06:41.790 --> 02:06:41.800 align:start position:0%
the you know when I look at the benefit
 
02:06:44.589 --> 02:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
schedule um this is one of the the
 
02:06:46.030 --> 02:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
current benefit schedule this is one of
 
02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
the rare policies where higher income
 
02:06:50.430 --> 02:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
folks are more
 
02:06:52.589 --> 02:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged um you know people who are
 
02:06:56.109 --> 02:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
making above 41,500 have the lowest
 
02:06:58.430 --> 02:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
replacement rates the replacement rates
 
02:07:01.470 --> 02:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
at the lower half or the the current
 
02:07:05.549 --> 02:07:05.559 align:start position:0%
below 40 anyone making 415 or below are
 
02:07:08.709 --> 02:07:08.719 align:start position:0%
well within the national averages that's
 
02:07:11.310 --> 02:07:11.320 align:start position:0%
you know kind of where around a 50
 
02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 50 to 60% replacement rate
 
02:07:17.790 --> 02:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
that seems to be where Most states are
 
02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
it's at the top of those making more
 
02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:21.030 align:start position:0%
it's at the top of those making more
than

02:07:21.030 --> 02:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:07:24.390 --> 02:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
415 um where we disadvantage workers
 
02:07:29.470 --> 02:07:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman um you
 
02:07:34.229 --> 02:07:34.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned the 54 and the 58% is that
 
02:07:37.790 --> 02:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
gross or net replacement is it replacing
 
02:07:40.109 --> 02:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
58% is their gross pay or 58% of their
 
02:07:43.109 --> 02:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
net pay uh that's their gross pay thank
 
02:07:44.910 --> 02:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
you and follow Mr
 
02:07:48.069 --> 02:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
chairman um so you talked about the
 
02:07:50.950 --> 02:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
positive negative ratings for employers
 
02:07:53.950 --> 02:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
would this widen the gap between
 
02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
negative and positive um employers
 
02:07:58.189 --> 02:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
because of the use of additional
 
02:07:59.709 --> 02:07:59.719 align:start position:0%
benefits at the higher
 
02:08:03.750 --> 02:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
tiers um given seasonal I'm not to call
 
02:08:05.790 --> 02:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
anybody out but seasonal employers would
 
02:08:08.709 --> 02:08:08.719 align:start position:0%
be typically have the highest negative
 
02:08:11.310 --> 02:08:11.320 align:start position:0%
ratings and the positive employers would
 
02:08:13.709 --> 02:08:13.719 align:start position:0%
have to I don't want say subsidize but
 
02:08:15.629 --> 02:08:15.639 align:start position:0%
make up that difference in the trust
 
02:08:15.639 --> 02:08:16.589 align:start position:0%
make up that difference in the trust
fund

02:08:16.589 --> 02:08:16.599 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:08:21.470 --> 02:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:24.189 --> 02:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
as um so so with your your positive and
 
02:08:27.069 --> 02:08:27.079 align:start position:0%
negative rated employers the
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
um if if an employer had had experience
 
02:08:35.870 --> 02:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
that was teetering right on the edge of
 
02:08:38.109 --> 02:08:38.119 align:start position:0%
uh going from positive to negative or
 
02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
vice versa um an increase in benefits
 
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
going out to their former
 
02:08:48.430 --> 02:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
employees um could uh tip them um
 
02:08:50.350 --> 02:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
towards that that negative rating where
 
02:08:52.229 --> 02:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
they have more benefit payments going
 
02:08:52.239 --> 02:08:54.310 align:start position:0%
they have more benefit payments going
out

02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:08:59.910 --> 02:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
um overall um I I don't see that as
 
02:09:03.750 --> 02:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
significant uh with the the proposals
 
02:09:06.709 --> 02:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about here um but if
 
02:09:09.350 --> 02:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
you were an employer that was close to
 
02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
going negative um I can see you know an
 
02:09:15.189 --> 02:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
increase in benefits depending on what's
 
02:09:17.990 --> 02:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
going on um with your employment pattern
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%
um and increase in benefits um could
 
02:09:22.430 --> 02:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
have an impact and it it could have an
 
02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
impact on your experience rate as
 
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
well we're also talking about the fund
 
02:09:31.030 --> 02:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
balance uh reduction uh balance
 
02:09:32.910 --> 02:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
thresholds would those be
 
02:09:36.990 --> 02:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
changing in 1522 or 436 and what would
 
02:09:39.709 --> 02:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
the impacts be for a negative and a
 
02:09:44.589 --> 02:09:44.599 align:start position:0%
positive employer um the amended version
 
02:09:48.109 --> 02:09:48.119 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 1522 does not um at at
 
02:09:50.109 --> 02:09:50.119 align:start position:0%
least Le the version that I've seen does
 
02:09:54.030 --> 02:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
not um uh propose any change to the fund
 
02:09:56.350 --> 02:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
balance reduction thresholds the Senate
 
02:10:00.750 --> 02:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
proposal does uh so um right now like I
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
had indicated we're at 250 million 350
 
02:10:08.910 --> 02:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
and 400 uh the Senate proposal uh would
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
go up to uh 300 3 no sorry 350
 
02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
375 and
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
450 and interestingly because of where
 
02:10:24.109 --> 02:10:24.119 align:start position:0%
the trust fund currently is right now
 
02:10:27.549 --> 02:10:27.559 align:start position:0%
and forecasted to be right in that um
 
02:10:31.310 --> 02:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
you know mid 390s to low $400 million
 
02:10:34.069 --> 02:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
range uh that would actually not have an
 
02:10:36.990 --> 02:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
impact on the forecasted fund balance
 
02:10:40.069 --> 02:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
reductions that employers um are
 
02:10:42.510 --> 02:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
forecasted to get through the end of
 
02:10:45.790 --> 02:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
20125 again because of where we are with
 
02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
our existing balance and what those
 
02:10:49.990 --> 02:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
proposed amounts are now certainly there
 
02:10:52.229 --> 02:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
would be an impact um coming out of the
 
02:10:54.910 --> 02:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
next downturn um where employers that
 
02:10:57.229 --> 02:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
were accustomed to getting a half Point
 
02:11:00.270 --> 02:11:00.280 align:start position:0%
reduction when the fund returned to 250
 
02:11:03.030 --> 02:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
million um they wouldn't see that until
 
02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
the fund returned to 350 million so
 
02:11:07.990 --> 02:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
there would be an impact down the road
 
02:11:09.910 --> 02:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
but there would not be an impact in the
 
02:11:13.470 --> 02:11:13.480 align:start position:0%
immediate um shortterm uh forecast for
 
02:11:16.750 --> 02:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
where the trust fund currently
 
02:11:18.830 --> 02:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
is well
 
02:11:23.390 --> 02:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
um was that factored into the from the
 
02:11:25.750 --> 02:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
2008 to 2014 that we spoke about earlier
 
02:11:27.629 --> 02:11:27.639 align:start position:0%
for the fund balance to regain its
 
02:11:30.709 --> 02:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
traction out of the good re the Great
 
02:11:33.950 --> 02:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
Recession has that been facted into
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
right now if that happened again what
 
02:11:37.790 --> 02:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
you just spoke
 
02:11:41.149 --> 02:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
about there was no adjustment to the um
 
02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
in either of these forast to the fund
 
02:11:44.990 --> 02:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
balance reduction
 
02:11:48.189 --> 02:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
triggers so we didn't factor that those
 
02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
into either of these um either of these
 
02:11:54.350 --> 02:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
forecasts and how long would it be to
 
02:11:56.189 --> 02:11:56.199 align:start position:0%
get from let's say we draw drew it down
 
02:11:58.270 --> 02:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
to 100 million in a big downturn how
 
02:12:00.350 --> 02:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
long would it be for us to get employees
 
02:12:03.669 --> 02:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
back up to the 450 so they can get back
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
to it it' be it would be very very
 
02:12:10.430 --> 02:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
difficult um one because while you're
 
02:12:12.589 --> 02:12:12.599 align:start position:0%
the benefit payment would consistently
 
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
be higher the tax rates would be higher
 
02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
so you just reach a different
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
equilibrium and
 
02:12:21.030 --> 02:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
it you know at whatever benefit schedule
 
02:12:22.270 --> 02:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
you have you're going to reach an
 
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
equilibrium point eventually um we're
 
02:12:28.549 --> 02:12:28.559 align:start position:0%
kind of at that right now around 400
 
02:12:30.430 --> 02:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
million but if we adjust the benefit
 
02:12:32.350 --> 02:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
schedule it's going to change and that
 
02:12:34.430 --> 02:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
equilibrium level is probably going to
 
02:12:38.589 --> 02:12:38.599 align:start position:0%
go down um but you I can't we can't we
 
02:12:40.069 --> 02:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
haven't modeled that so it's difficult
 
02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
to say but um I don't expect that we
 
02:12:45.910 --> 02:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
would get to 450 million um it would not
 
02:12:48.589 --> 02:12:48.599 align:start position:0%
my lifetime I'm getting near the end of
 
02:12:50.750 --> 02:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
it um it it it's difficult because you
 
02:12:52.750 --> 02:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
don't I mean it's all influenced by the
 
02:12:55.149 --> 02:12:55.159 align:start position:0%
pace of hiring right so coming out of
 
02:12:57.709 --> 02:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
the Great Recession an incredibly slow
 
02:12:59.629 --> 02:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
pace of hiring director gotop talking
 
02:13:02.470 --> 02:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
about six years to get back to the level
 
02:13:04.430 --> 02:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
of employment private sector employment
 
02:13:07.030 --> 02:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
that we had prior to the Great Recession
 
02:13:09.109 --> 02:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
you know then spin forward to the
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic um and we
 
02:13:16.510 --> 02:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
had a very quick return um with robust
 
02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
hiring coming out of that so um all of
 
02:13:21.669 --> 02:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
that influences the taxes that are being
 
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
paid by employers that are going back
 
02:13:25.270 --> 02:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
into the trust fund to build up that
 
02:13:27.910 --> 02:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
Reserve so it's difficult if not
 
02:13:30.270 --> 02:13:30.280 align:start position:0%
impossible to predict what that pace of
 
02:13:32.430 --> 02:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
hiring would be coming out of that
 
02:13:35.030 --> 02:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
downturn thank you and my final followup
 
02:13:36.669 --> 02:13:36.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman final are we looking to
 
02:13:36.679 --> 02:13:38.350 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman final are we looking to
increase

02:13:38.350 --> 02:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:13:42.310 --> 02:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
the fund balance to 450 million before
 
02:13:45.310 --> 02:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
all um benefits not benefits all
 
02:13:48.109 --> 02:13:48.119 align:start position:0%
reductions are had by employers because
 
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's looking like we've been hovering at
 
02:13:51.470 --> 02:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
400 million are we looking to increase
 
02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
that to 450 and stay at 450 for the
 
02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:56.549 align:start position:0%
that to 450 and stay at 450 for the
foreseeable

02:13:56.549 --> 02:13:56.559 align:start position:0%
foreseeable
 
02:13:59.589 --> 02:13:59.599 align:start position:0%
future um that is contained within the

it so
 
02:15:14.589 --> 02:15:14.599 align:start position:0%
um the bill in front of us is uh
 
02:15:17.870 --> 02:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
1522 representative McKenzie uh sent
 
02:15:22.189 --> 02:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:24.990 --> 02:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
um representative you're going to sit
 
02:15:26.510 --> 02:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
back over here in your chair so we can
 
02:15:33.549 --> 02:15:33.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment so let me talk about a little
 
02:15:38.350 --> 02:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
bit of uh discussions that
 
02:15:40.270 --> 02:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth Sullivan
 
02:15:41.950 --> 02:15:41.960 align:start position:0%
McKenzie and I have
 
02:15:45.390 --> 02:15:45.400 align:start position:0%
had um I
 
02:15:48.510 --> 02:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
prefer the Senate bill
 
02:15:50.750 --> 02:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh because it happens immediately versus
 
02:15:52.030 --> 02:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
tiered and there's some other things I
 
02:15:55.549 --> 02:15:55.559 align:start position:0%
like in it but um and and from my
 
02:15:56.669 --> 02:15:56.679 align:start position:0%
understanding it's going to have some
 
02:15:58.390 --> 02:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
pretty good legs in the
 
02:16:01.990 --> 02:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
Senate um and but I don't want
 
02:16:05.709 --> 02:16:05.719 align:start position:0%
to um in case something goes
 
02:16:11.189 --> 02:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
ay on its way over here I don't want to
 
02:16:14.589 --> 02:16:14.599 align:start position:0%
not have a bill to deal with on this
 
02:16:17.229 --> 02:16:17.239 align:start position:0%
side we're in the second year of a turn
 
02:16:19.950 --> 02:16:19.960 align:start position:0%
so I can't can't retain it it has to go
 
02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
to inter room study and then you can't
 
02:16:22.510 --> 02:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
pull it
 
02:16:26.069 --> 02:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
off what can be done is whether we vote
 
02:16:28.950 --> 02:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
10 to 10 here in the committee it goes
 
02:16:31.950 --> 02:16:31.960 align:start position:0%
to the house floor representative
 
02:16:35.830 --> 02:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
McKenzie and I agree that we table the
 
02:16:39.070 --> 02:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
bill um and we wait and see what comes
 
02:16:41.509 --> 02:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
over uh at that point if it comes over
 
02:16:43.150 --> 02:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
it's been messed up we don't like it we
 
02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
have representative uh we we can amend
 
02:16:47.950 --> 02:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
it here from the Senate Bill if if it
 
02:16:52.230 --> 02:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't come over from the Senate we can
 
02:16:54.389 --> 02:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
come up with uh any kind of amendments
 
02:16:54.399 --> 02:16:55.349 align:start position:0%
come up with uh any kind of amendments
we

02:16:55.349 --> 02:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:16:58.629 --> 02:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
want uh and uh move it off the table if
 
02:17:00.389 --> 02:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
we all if we agree to to where it's
 
02:17:03.270 --> 02:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
going we can move it off the table um in
 
02:17:05.230 --> 02:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
the house with the
 
02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
amendment strategically I don't know any
 
02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
other better way to skin the cat
 
02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:13.589 align:start position:0%
other better way to skin the cat
representative

02:17:13.589 --> 02:17:13.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
Sullivan yeah the basically if we
 
02:17:18.589 --> 02:17:18.599 align:start position:0%
anything else we do with the bill it's
 
02:17:22.309 --> 02:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
it's gone it's dead um and I think this
 
02:17:24.309 --> 02:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
strategy and I think a 10 to 10 vote is
 
02:17:27.070 --> 02:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
fine um I think it it leaves us with an
 
02:17:30.429 --> 02:17:30.439 align:start position:0%
ought to pass um well leaves us with no
 
02:17:32.469 --> 02:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
recommendation which goes to ought to
 
02:17:34.230 --> 02:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
pass so if we needed to deal with it on
 
02:17:37.870 --> 02:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
the um house floor um in all likelihood
 
02:17:40.429 --> 02:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
we would be dealing with an amendment
 
02:17:43.709 --> 02:17:43.719 align:start position:0%
and it would be well positioned that way
 
02:17:48.549 --> 02:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
um to take amendments um
 
02:17:52.110 --> 02:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
okay he said he could stay till one no
 
02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:53.309 align:start position:0%
okay he said he could stay till one no
he

02:17:53.309 --> 02:17:53.319 align:start position:0%
he
 
02:17:57.429 --> 02:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
left I don't think so I'm not sure any
 
02:18:01.549 --> 02:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:04.549 --> 02:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
someone could you check
 
02:18:04.559 --> 02:18:08.990 align:start position:0%
someone could you check
please

02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:11.190 --> 02:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
just I guess we'll see if we have a 10
 
02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
to 10 um but uh but I I regardless uh I
 
02:18:20.349 --> 02:18:20.359 align:start position:0%
think it would be helpful if if it was
 
02:18:24.190 --> 02:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
positioned with an ought to pass um when
 
02:18:26.790 --> 02:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
when we uh get to the floor if if we
 
02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:27.469 align:start position:0%
when we uh get to the floor if if we
have

02:18:27.469 --> 02:18:27.479 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:18:30.190 --> 02:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
to engage in the circus hopefully the
 
02:18:32.349 --> 02:18:32.359 align:start position:0%
Senate bill will come over we'll deal
 
02:18:34.469 --> 02:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
with it appropriately it'll become um
 
02:18:37.750 --> 02:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
the bill that goes to the floor um but
 
02:18:41.629 --> 02:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
if um if that doesn't work um I I would
 
02:18:45.709 --> 02:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
encourage us um to have either 1010 vote
 
02:18:49.509 --> 02:18:49.519 align:start position:0%
if we have our people or um an aut toass
 
02:18:52.990 --> 02:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
outcome so that um we don't have to go
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
through the
 
02:18:57.750 --> 02:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
um the process of
 
02:19:00.509 --> 02:19:00.519 align:start position:0%
uh um overcoming an
 
02:19:04.669 --> 02:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
itl then moving um a to pass then moving
 
02:19:07.190 --> 02:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
an amendment um and then getting it
 
02:19:09.910 --> 02:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
through I mean basically it just seems
 
02:19:12.389 --> 02:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
to be um a cleaner way for us to proceed
 
02:19:15.429 --> 02:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
if we have to engage in this uh
 
02:19:18.750 --> 02:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
exercise R McKenzie
 
02:19:22.230 --> 02:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
pine I mean I I think it's important to
 
02:19:29.830 --> 02:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's important to uh keep
 
02:19:32.110 --> 02:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
this uh legislation alive there are a
 
02:19:34.190 --> 02:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
lot of commonalities between the Senate
 
02:19:35.589 --> 02:19:35.599 align:start position:0%
version and the house
 
02:19:40.709 --> 02:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
version um and I think uh overarching is
 
02:19:43.110 --> 02:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
that there needs to be something done uh
 
02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
to increase the uh the unemployment rate
 
02:19:47.910 --> 02:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
in the state it's been since 200 seven
 
02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
since they made any changes to this and
 
02:19:53.950 --> 02:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
uh especially those people at the top
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
you you're seeing a you know a real uh
 
02:20:00.349 --> 02:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
uh inequity uh between the replacement
 
02:20:02.270 --> 02:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
rate that they they enjoy and those
 
02:20:03.710 --> 02:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
people are in different places in the
 
02:20:05.910 --> 02:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
schedule and this legislation tried to
 
02:20:08.710 --> 02:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
even that even that out so I think I I
 
02:20:11.550 --> 02:20:11.560 align:start position:0%
think we have an opportunity to uh you
 
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
know to get together with the Senate I
 
02:20:14.990 --> 02:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
tried to get a hold of those people
 
02:20:17.230 --> 02:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
contacted all of them I wasn't able to
 
02:20:20.309 --> 02:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh connect with them but uh I think we
 
02:20:23.630 --> 02:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
can keep this alive um I think it makes
 
02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of sense and and what
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan is saying is
 
02:20:30.990 --> 02:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
that we we try to do the art to pass and
 
02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know and then on the floor we
 
02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
table it I would I agreed with the uh uh
 
02:20:40.790 --> 02:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:44.070 --> 02:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
that yeah representative barudi had to
 
02:20:46.830 --> 02:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
um he's a court mediator he had to be in
 
02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
Salem by 1 p.m. so he did
 
02:20:52.510 --> 02:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
leave we we both thought we would have
 
02:20:55.030 --> 02:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
been done by now um I don't think we he
 
02:20:56.990 --> 02:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
realized we were going to do a work
 
02:20:59.190 --> 02:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
session or he had planned to be here for
 
02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:39.510 align:start position:0%
 
votes

02:21:39.510 --> 02:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:41.670 --> 02:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
chicken I I just think we have to do
 
02:21:44.510 --> 02:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
something it's been 15 years we need to
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
do something um representative
 
02:21:50.230 --> 02:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
McKenzie's has a little time period
 
02:21:53.469 --> 02:21:53.479 align:start position:0%
That's is why the the threeyear phase in
 
02:21:55.990 --> 02:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
which is why his numbers in a recession
 
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
or higher I like to implement it
 
02:22:00.670 --> 02:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
immediately I like the stepping I I
 
02:22:02.349 --> 02:22:02.359 align:start position:0%
discussed in the Employment Securities
 
02:22:06.550 --> 02:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board the 250 350 400 is too
 
02:22:09.950 --> 02:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
low where the trust fund needs to be now
 
02:22:12.750 --> 02:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
okay as as as a percentage of if you
 
02:22:14.830 --> 02:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
look back and where when I first started
 
02:22:17.750 --> 02:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
this gig it was like 200 250 27 5 or
 
02:22:21.030 --> 02:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
something um it hits a lot of the points
 
02:22:22.710 --> 02:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not saying we can't make some
 
02:22:25.790 --> 02:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
amendments we got to see what comes over
 
02:22:28.469 --> 02:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
um I'm just realistic that if we if we
 
02:22:30.190 --> 02:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
pass something over to the Senate that
 
02:22:32.429 --> 02:22:32.439 align:start position:0%
is is is different significantly
 
02:22:34.510 --> 02:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
different and from theirs that they're
 
02:22:36.070 --> 02:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
just going to dismiss it anyway and I
 
02:22:38.309 --> 02:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
just I want to keep it as a kind of a
 
02:22:40.389 --> 02:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
thing on the side so I think we all kind
 
02:22:42.030 --> 02:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
of agreed is this kind of the strategy
 
02:22:43.510 --> 02:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
of what it's going to do we're going to
 
02:22:46.110 --> 02:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
do the 99 to make it easy for everybody
 
02:22:48.270 --> 02:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
and then um representative McKenzie and
 
02:22:50.830 --> 02:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
I on the floor we'll we'll speak to uh
 
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
the tabling um together and and and we
 
02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
move forward with what the sener brings
 
02:22:58.910 --> 02:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
over representative Sullivan yeah just
 
02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
very quickly I I with regard to the two
 
02:23:04.150 --> 02:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
bills Senate and House I I can live with
 
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
either one um I think they both
 
02:23:09.270 --> 02:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
accomplish what I would like to think
 
02:23:11.870 --> 02:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
that we all want to accomplish um which
 
02:23:16.590 --> 02:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
is uh you know ra raising that U maximum
 
02:23:16.600 --> 02:23:17.670 align:start position:0%
is uh you know ra raising that U maximum
salary

02:23:17.670 --> 02:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
salary
 
02:23:20.670 --> 02:23:20.680 align:start position:0%
um so at any rate um I'm I'm good with
 
02:23:22.750 --> 02:23:22.760 align:start position:0%

chairman I like this bill um and it it
 
02:30:02.910 --> 02:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
took me a while when I first looked at
 
02:30:06.429 --> 02:30:06.439 align:start position:0%
the text I didn't get it then the
 
02:30:08.590 --> 02:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor started explaining what he
 
02:30:11.990 --> 02:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to do and I started to get it and
 
02:30:14.150 --> 02:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
then I went home and I made some charts
 
02:30:16.110 --> 02:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
and I made some spreadsheets and I did
 
02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
LUN of
 
02:30:22.990 --> 02:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
calculations and and I really get it um
 
02:30:27.630 --> 02:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
I I think though the amendment that he
 
02:30:30.070 --> 02:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
gave us uh when we had the public
 
02:30:32.269 --> 02:30:32.279 align:start position:0%

02:30:38.349 --> 02:30:38.359 align:start position:0%
ready um it has some problems and I
 
02:30:41.910 --> 02:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
could go into those problems but having
 
02:30:44.190 --> 02:30:44.200 align:start position:0%
moved interim study I'd probably lose
 
02:30:46.190 --> 02:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
some of the support I have cuz now if we
 
02:30:48.510 --> 02:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
vote interm study then we don't have to
 
02:30:51.630 --> 02:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
go into the details and the spreadsheets
 
02:30:53.910 --> 02:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
and the calculations of the graphs now
 
02:30:57.269 --> 02:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
we can wait and do that in interim study
 
02:30:59.150 --> 02:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
the real reason I'm asking you to
 
02:31:02.070 --> 02:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
interim study this bill is I think it's
 
02:31:05.429 --> 02:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
premature we just spent a lot of time
 
02:31:08.150 --> 02:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
talking about two bills one in the house
 
02:31:11.230 --> 02:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
one in the Senate that are proposing
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
some very large changes to the overall
 
02:31:15.359 --> 02:31:18.790 align:start position:0%
some very large changes to the overall
unemployment

02:31:18.790 --> 02:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:22.230 --> 02:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
structure and this is a little change
 
02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
that has to do with what happens when
 
02:31:26.349 --> 02:31:26.359 align:start position:0%
somebody's earning some
 
02:31:30.230 --> 02:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
part-time that's the tail of the dog
 
02:31:32.389 --> 02:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
that is the whole package so any
 
02:31:34.630 --> 02:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
assumptions that I would make any of
 
02:31:37.590 --> 02:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
those calculations I did are all thrown
 
02:31:40.670 --> 02:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
out the window when we adopt some new
 
02:31:43.830 --> 02:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
tables which from what I've heard it
 
02:31:46.349 --> 02:31:46.359 align:start position:0%
sounds like that's that's pending some
 
02:31:48.349 --> 02:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
some time before the end of the year
 
02:31:50.790 --> 02:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
furthermore uh the Deputy Commissioner
 
02:31:53.110 --> 02:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
has said that he has some more data that
 
02:31:56.870 --> 02:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
he can provide about what happens um
 
02:31:59.429 --> 02:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
with people who are on unemployment but
 
02:32:01.230 --> 02:32:01.240 align:start position:0%
also getting part-time I think that
 
02:32:03.950 --> 02:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
would be very valuable in evaluating
 
02:32:06.950 --> 02:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
potential amendments um I
 
02:32:10.469 --> 02:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
have an idea of what would be a good
 
02:32:12.950 --> 02:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
amendment that I think solves all of the
 
02:32:15.710 --> 02:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
problems that I've identified with the
 
02:32:17.469 --> 02:32:17.479 align:start position:0%
um original proposal I know
 
02:32:19.469 --> 02:32:19.479 align:start position:0%
representative kahill also has an
 
02:32:21.600 --> 02:32:21.610 align:start position:0%
amendment that um could
 
02:32:21.610 --> 02:32:23.510 align:start position:0%
amendment that um could
[Music]

02:32:23.510 --> 02:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:32:26.550 --> 02:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
solve maybe not exactly the same set of
 
02:32:28.630 --> 02:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
problems that I'm solving but also solve
 
02:32:31.990 --> 02:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
those problems um I could very well be
 
02:32:34.550 --> 02:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
convinced that your version is better
 
02:32:36.670 --> 02:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
than mine or I might think my version is
 
02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
better also again I think a better um
 
02:32:44.030 --> 02:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
discussion to have uh within the context
 
02:32:46.309 --> 02:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
of an interim study and preparing a
 
02:32:49.110 --> 02:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
report for once we know how we've
 
02:32:51.269 --> 02:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
changed unemployment then what's the
 
02:32:53.910 --> 02:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
right way to solve this problem that was
 
02:32:58.269 --> 02:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
presented to us so I would ask you um
 
02:33:01.230 --> 02:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
whether you think this bill is a good
 
02:33:05.190 --> 02:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
idea or a bad idea or whether um if
 
02:33:07.469 --> 02:33:07.479 align:start position:0%
you've seen my charts and graphs if you
 
02:33:09.790 --> 02:33:09.800 align:start position:0%
if you like my idea if you if you like
 
02:33:12.870 --> 02:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
what uh representative kahill is is um
 
02:33:15.950 --> 02:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
proposing I would ask you um to agree
 
02:33:19.510 --> 02:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
with me that interim study is a proper
 
02:33:22.309 --> 02:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
approach to deal with this bill at this
 
02:33:26.990 --> 02:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
time thank you k Mr chairman I uh I
 
02:33:29.110 --> 02:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the charts and graphs uh
 
02:33:31.670 --> 02:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
but I did have some reservations about
 
02:33:33.870 --> 02:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
uh about the bill itself uh there were a
 
02:33:36.750 --> 02:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
lot of rather drastic changes to how
 
02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
what what would be uh excluded and not
 
02:33:42.469 --> 02:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
concluded and I think the uh the I've
 
02:33:45.190 --> 02:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
also had a conversation with Mr lers and
 
02:33:49.389 --> 02:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
I think the simple adjustment to the uh
 
02:33:51.870 --> 02:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
to the disregard would be something that
 
02:33:53.830 --> 02:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
we could do without gumming up the whole
 
02:33:56.510 --> 02:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
works and would be a positive step for
 
02:33:58.750 --> 02:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
those people who are who are look who
 
02:34:01.269 --> 02:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
are offered an opportunity to work uh
 
02:34:04.550 --> 02:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
maybe a few days or a or a day or two uh
 
02:34:06.550 --> 02:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
and then have to do the calculation as
 
02:34:08.830 --> 02:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
to whether or not uh the cost for their
 
02:34:10.550 --> 02:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
child care the cost for this the cost
 
02:34:12.389 --> 02:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
for that and then they lose so much of
 
02:34:15.670 --> 02:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
their benefits uh I think expanding to
 
02:34:18.910 --> 02:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
uh from 30 to 40% for the disregard is a
 
02:34:21.070 --> 02:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable step and it doesn't uh
 
02:34:26.550 --> 02:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:30.630 --> 02:34:30.640 align:start position:0%
harm SE I was hoping not to do any math
 
02:34:33.150 --> 02:34:33.160 align:start position:0%
today um
 
02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:35.710 align:start position:0%
today um
but

02:34:35.710 --> 02:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:34:38.429 --> 02:34:38.439 align:start position:0%
so it is
 
02:34:42.230 --> 02:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
difficult to make that determination
 
02:34:45.389 --> 02:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
without knowing what that limit's going
 
02:34:48.429 --> 02:34:48.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:53.110 --> 02:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
so if the um maximum weekly benefit
 
02:34:56.309 --> 02:34:56.319 align:start position:0%
amount remained at 427 and the cap
 
02:34:59.590 --> 02:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:02.349 --> 02:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
128 I could agree with your assessment
 
02:35:04.670 --> 02:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
because I've done that calculation it's
 
02:35:06.190 --> 02:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
it's mid
 
02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
$50 that would that would someone would
 
02:35:12.990 --> 02:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
earn extra 40 it's only 40 no I thought
 
02:35:14.990 --> 02:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
it was 128 to
 
02:35:17.190 --> 02:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
170 go ahead doesn't matter regard
 
02:35:21.790 --> 02:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:25.110 --> 02:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
um but what if it goes to a number that
 
02:35:27.710 --> 02:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
we don't know what that is yet and can
 
02:35:30.030 --> 02:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
we say that that won't have one of the
 
02:35:31.510 --> 02:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
problems there are number several
 
02:35:34.910 --> 02:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
problems with Bill uh besides its
 
02:35:37.269 --> 02:35:37.279 align:start position:0%
complexity another one that I had an
 
02:35:38.990 --> 02:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
issue with and I think probably you have
 
02:35:41.630 --> 02:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
an issue with is what happens at the
 
02:35:45.230 --> 02:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
very low end when you're making say $50
 
02:35:48.469 --> 02:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
part-time just working a couple hours
 
02:35:51.309 --> 02:35:51.319 align:start position:0%
right now you get that over and above
 
02:35:53.950 --> 02:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
your check under the the language of the
 
02:35:55.830 --> 02:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
pro proposed Bill you'd only get a
 
02:35:57.630 --> 02:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
portion of that and I don't think any of
 
02:36:01.830 --> 02:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
us likes the idea of taking money away
 
02:36:05.309 --> 02:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
um from someone who was getting so
 
02:36:07.110 --> 02:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
little to begin with so that would need
 
02:36:10.030 --> 02:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
to be solved the other issue though and
 
02:36:12.750 --> 02:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
and I I think your version does solve
 
02:36:14.790 --> 02:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
that the other issue though was the one
 
02:36:17.230 --> 02:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
that the Deputy Commissioner brought up
 
02:36:22.830 --> 02:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
that this idea of at what point
 
02:36:26.230 --> 02:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
does adding benefits that aren't paid
 
02:36:30.150 --> 02:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
now create an incentive and that we'd
 
02:36:34.550 --> 02:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
see people staying on on in the system
 
02:36:37.269 --> 02:36:37.279 align:start position:0%
longer and that's the one that I can't
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
answer if I to me I need to know what
 
02:36:43.309 --> 02:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
the numbers are to be able to evaluate
 
02:36:46.670 --> 02:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
that and that's why I'm saying let's do
 
02:36:49.590 --> 02:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
these in sequence let's know what that
 
02:36:52.590 --> 02:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
number is it won't be 170 anymore it
 
02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:54.070 align:start position:0%
number is it won't be 170 anymore it
might

02:36:54.070 --> 02:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
might
 
02:36:58.550 --> 02:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
be two 220 something I don't know
 
02:37:02.150 --> 02:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
there's another number that's up there
 
02:37:04.910 --> 02:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
that's higher in fact substantially
 
02:37:06.469 --> 02:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
higher than the change we're talking
 
02:37:09.590 --> 02:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
about would be this un unknown change
 
02:37:12.670 --> 02:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
that comes when the other bill passes so
 
02:37:15.389 --> 02:37:15.399 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm asking that we consider
 
02:37:17.710 --> 02:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
them in sequence let's know what we're
 
02:37:21.750 --> 02:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
looking at before we propose the change
 
02:37:21.760 --> 02:37:23.870 align:start position:0%
looking at before we propose the change
repres

02:37:23.870 --> 02:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
repres
 
02:37:25.830 --> 02:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
Sullivan Mr chairman I'm Wonder
 
02:37:27.150 --> 02:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
wondering if there might be some value
 
02:37:31.269 --> 02:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
to um having U Mr lers weigh in on this
 
02:37:33.670 --> 02:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
so that uh we can take advantage of his
 
02:37:35.349 --> 02:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
expertise as long as he's
 
02:37:37.349 --> 02:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
here yeah that's
 
02:37:39.429 --> 02:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
fine I know I've discussed it with him
 
02:37:40.750 --> 02:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
so I know what he's going to say so
 
02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:44.790 align:start position:0%
so I know what he's going to say so
that's

02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:50.190 align:start position:0%
 
fine

02:37:50.190 --> 02:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:51.750 --> 02:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
good to see
 
02:37:55.230 --> 02:37:55.240 align:start position:0%
everybody um the original Bill the
 
02:37:57.630 --> 02:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
department had concerns with regard to
 
02:37:59.150 --> 02:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
the the changes that were going to be
 
02:38:01.750 --> 02:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
made with uh what would be regarded as
 
02:38:05.110 --> 02:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
earnings and what would not um and also
 
02:38:08.070 --> 02:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
we had concerns with the mechanical
 
02:38:11.150 --> 02:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
changes to how the earnings disregard
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
would be applied uh what is being
 
02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
discussed now goes back to what we have
 
02:38:20.510 --> 02:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
what we currently have and that the when
 
02:38:23.070 --> 02:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
we're when we're looking at an earnings
 
02:38:25.550 --> 02:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
disregard an individuals allowed to have
 
02:38:28.950 --> 02:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
part-time employment and those part-time
 
02:38:31.870 --> 02:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
uh dollars need to uh then be reported
 
02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
to the department so we can determine
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not it needs to um make an
 
02:38:38.630 --> 02:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
causes an adjustment to their weekly
 
02:38:41.630 --> 02:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit the denominator is
 
02:38:44.389 --> 02:38:44.399 align:start position:0%
the weekly unemployment benefit not the
 
02:38:47.030 --> 02:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
amount of earnings that they get um so
 
02:38:49.990 --> 02:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
if we go back uh to that uh the
 
02:38:53.190 --> 02:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
department is much more comfortable um
 
02:38:55.190 --> 02:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
with looking at the maintaining the
 
02:38:58.550 --> 02:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
existing structure whether or not the
 
02:39:02.630 --> 02:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
amount of the uh earnings whether it's
 
02:39:04.550 --> 02:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
the the disregard is at
 
02:39:06.469 --> 02:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
30% uh or
 
02:39:10.670 --> 02:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
40% I think you know that's left um to
 
02:39:13.230 --> 02:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
the committee to decide uh what you want
 
02:39:15.710 --> 02:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
to do with that but the department for
 
02:39:17.349 --> 02:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
from where where our concerns were
 
02:39:19.990 --> 02:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
originally um those would be addressed
 
02:39:22.710 --> 02:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
by going back to U maintaining the
 
02:39:26.269 --> 02:39:26.279 align:start position:0%
existing structure um and then looking
 
02:39:28.469 --> 02:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
at whether or not the amount of earnings
 
02:39:30.429 --> 02:39:30.439 align:start position:0%
that someone is allowed to keep before
 
02:39:33.269 --> 02:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
it impacts their unemployment um whether
 
02:39:35.750 --> 02:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
or not that's the right amount now we
 
02:39:39.309 --> 02:39:39.319 align:start position:0%
are um I'm expecting hopefully this week
 
02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
um representative seaworth had mentioned
 
02:39:46.790 --> 02:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
this that um a a data query of the 2023
 
02:39:49.950 --> 02:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
claim filers that will show the number
 
02:39:49.960 --> 02:39:50.870 align:start position:0%
claim filers that will show the number
of

02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:39:52.830 --> 02:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
individuals um that had part-time
 
02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
earnings that were less than 30% of
 
02:39:56.990 --> 02:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
their weekly benefit amount and we'll
 
02:39:59.469 --> 02:39:59.479 align:start position:0%
show the number of individuals that had
 
02:40:01.830 --> 02:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
part-time earnings that were more than
 
02:40:04.510 --> 02:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
30% of their weekly benefit amount so we
 
02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
can actually see it in real life uh what
 
02:40:09.670 --> 02:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
that looked like in the 2023 claim
 
02:40:13.670 --> 02:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
filing year um and you'll also be able
 
02:40:17.790 --> 02:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
to see how much of the maximum benefit
 
02:40:21.309 --> 02:40:21.319 align:start position:0%
available to those individuals uh were
 
02:40:24.670 --> 02:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
utilized and did it make a difference uh
 
02:40:27.389 --> 02:40:27.399 align:start position:0%
for those that were below that 30%
 
02:40:30.710 --> 02:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
versus those that were above U because
 
02:40:34.750 --> 02:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
it's really um when you um look at
 
02:40:36.349 --> 02:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
impact on the trust fund that's where
 
02:40:38.550 --> 02:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
the you'd be able to derive that impact
 
02:40:41.590 --> 02:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
would be does that does allowing someone
 
02:40:45.070 --> 02:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
to retain um more of their weekly
 
02:40:48.269 --> 02:40:48.279 align:start position:0%
benefits amount um when they have those
 
02:40:50.790 --> 02:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
part-time earnings do they stay with
 
02:40:52.830 --> 02:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
that part-time employment longer
 
02:40:54.349 --> 02:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
supplemented with their with their
 
02:40:57.190 --> 02:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit um and thus utilize
 
02:41:00.190 --> 02:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
more of their maximum benefits available
 
02:41:02.030 --> 02:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
having more of a draw down on the trust
 
02:41:04.269 --> 02:41:04.279 align:start position:0%
fund versus someone being more
 
02:41:06.670 --> 02:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
incentivized to return to full-time
 
02:41:09.469 --> 02:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
employment so as soon as those numbers
 
02:41:13.070 --> 02:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
are available we'll provide those uh to
 
02:41:15.990 --> 02:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
um uh the chair and vice chair uh to be
 
02:41:17.429 --> 02:41:17.439 align:start position:0%
distributed out to the committee but I
 
02:41:19.630 --> 02:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
think that will be helpful information
 
02:41:22.110 --> 02:41:22.120 align:start position:0%
uh to have uh to look at what what
 
02:41:24.269 --> 02:41:24.279 align:start position:0%
currently you see with with the impacts
 
02:41:26.469 --> 02:41:26.479 align:start position:0%
and what the claim filing population
 
02:41:28.429 --> 02:41:28.439 align:start position:0%
looks like with the number of part-time
 
02:41:30.790 --> 02:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
earners above and below that current
 
02:41:30.800 --> 02:41:33.870 align:start position:0%
earners above and below that current
threshold

02:41:33.870 --> 02:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:37.309 --> 02:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
Solin it seems like if we're waiting for
 
02:41:41.590 --> 02:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
um data from the Department um and this
 
02:41:44.110 --> 02:41:44.120 align:start position:0%
bill does not have to be voted out today
 
02:41:48.870 --> 02:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:51.670 --> 02:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
Bill okay
 
02:41:53.790 --> 02:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
um I was going to suggest that we get
 
02:41:56.510 --> 02:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
the data and um see if we can still do
 
02:41:58.590 --> 02:41:58.600 align:start position:0%
something with this the the the thought
 
02:42:01.469 --> 02:42:01.479 align:start position:0%
process that I I that I come up with is
 
02:42:04.230 --> 02:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
a couple different items we get the
 
02:42:07.030 --> 02:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
information um we can have
 
02:42:09.230 --> 02:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth and Cahill go
 
02:42:12.590 --> 02:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
talk to the senator to see whether or
 
02:42:16.190 --> 02:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
not when that bill comes over here
 
02:42:18.389 --> 02:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
would she agree to add this amendment to
 
02:42:20.030 --> 02:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
it because then we'll know the numbers
 
02:42:21.349 --> 02:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
we'll know all the different things
 
02:42:24.030 --> 02:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
there a delicate balance here between
 
02:42:26.070 --> 02:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
having someone have too many part-time
 
02:42:28.550 --> 02:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
jobs which is against the concept of
 
02:42:30.910 --> 02:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
getting them full-time benefit full-time
 
02:42:34.429 --> 02:42:34.439 align:start position:0%
work and not making that giving them
 
02:42:36.429 --> 02:42:36.439 align:start position:0%
enough like because you know I I like
 
02:42:38.190 --> 02:42:38.200 align:start position:0%
you guys think that someone shouldn't be
 
02:42:39.710 --> 02:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
if if they have a full-time job and a
 
02:42:41.990 --> 02:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
part-time job they lose a part-time job
 
02:42:43.269 --> 02:42:43.279 align:start position:0%
full-time job and you take away the
 
02:42:45.950 --> 02:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
benefits of the a lot of the the
 
02:42:48.429 --> 02:42:48.439 align:start position:0%
you hit them because they're making
 
02:42:50.070 --> 02:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
money in the the parttime I don't like
 
02:42:52.349 --> 02:42:52.359 align:start position:0%
but I also can't have three or four
 
02:42:54.670 --> 02:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
different want people having three or
 
02:42:57.429 --> 02:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
four different part-time jobs and making
 
02:42:59.469 --> 02:42:59.479 align:start position:0%
so much that there's no incentive that
 
02:43:01.990 --> 02:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
that so there there's that delicate
 
02:43:04.030 --> 02:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
thing and right now the two the concept
 
02:43:05.910 --> 02:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
between the bill versus how we do it now
 
02:43:08.910 --> 02:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
are a little different so that was the
 
02:43:11.110 --> 02:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
the concept whether we do it ourselves
 
02:43:13.469 --> 02:43:13.479 align:start position:0%
add it on to M representative McKenzie's
 
02:43:14.710 --> 02:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
if something doesn't happen in the
 
02:43:14.720 --> 02:43:15.950 align:start position:0%
if something doesn't happen in the
Senate

02:43:15.950 --> 02:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
02:43:19.429 --> 02:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
or ask the senator to approve it to add
 
02:43:21.349 --> 02:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
it as an amendment or see if she would
 
02:43:22.910 --> 02:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
be agreeable that if we were going to
 
02:43:24.510 --> 02:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
add it to Amendment here if we agree
 
02:43:25.710 --> 02:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
with it when it goes back to them
 
02:43:28.349 --> 02:43:28.359 align:start position:0%
knowing well that they are going to
 
02:43:30.750 --> 02:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
accept it but I don't think it makes a
 
02:43:33.910 --> 02:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
lot of sense because right now and I'm
 
02:43:35.269 --> 02:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
sorry you don't have these charts but
 
02:43:38.110 --> 02:43:38.120 align:start position:0%
Brian went crazy on these these things
 
02:43:41.510 --> 02:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
um on on all these things there is a
 
02:43:45.269 --> 02:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
deficit if if you if if you go with the
 
02:43:47.269 --> 02:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
K's Amendment someone making a little
 
02:43:48.870 --> 02:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
bit actually gets hurt they make less
 
02:43:50.190 --> 02:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
than they would have under the current
 
02:43:52.309 --> 02:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
law well that's not what we want to do
 
02:43:53.429 --> 02:43:53.439 align:start position:0%
that's the original bill that's the
 
02:43:55.910 --> 02:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
other way right original right's
 
02:43:59.349 --> 02:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment I'm sorry I I I my apologies
 
02:44:00.750 --> 02:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure we have all
 
02:44:02.389 --> 02:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
the things right and with with what's
 
02:44:05.670 --> 02:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
going to go go on and what is the
 
02:44:07.910 --> 02:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
purpose of of passing the bill with an
 
02:44:09.510 --> 02:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
amendment now to the house floor with
 
02:44:11.990 --> 02:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
this when we don't have the information
 
02:44:13.550 --> 02:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
and we still have a mechanism to put it
 
02:44:15.429 --> 02:44:15.439 align:start position:0%
through that's that's where I was coming
 
02:44:16.990 --> 02:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
from you don't have to agree with me but
 
02:44:19.670 --> 02:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's the thought process I had
 
02:44:21.630 --> 02:44:21.640 align:start position:0%
represent that
 
02:44:21.640 --> 02:44:23.950 align:start position:0%
represent that
said

02:44:23.950 --> 02:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:44:27.030 --> 02:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
um and I'm just going go right out there
 
02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
and say I will support the interim study
 
02:44:31.750 --> 02:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
um with the understanding that you know
 
02:44:35.510 --> 02:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
and frankly the the issue that U
 
02:44:37.150 --> 02:44:37.160 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie is addressing
 
02:44:39.349 --> 02:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
with his bill the Senate is addressing
 
02:44:41.550 --> 02:44:41.560 align:start position:0%
with their bill um is the important
 
02:44:43.710 --> 02:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
issue that that's that's really where
 
02:44:45.469 --> 02:44:45.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to make some improvements to
 
02:44:48.630 --> 02:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
the system um this is a tweak that I
 
02:44:51.190 --> 02:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
think could help some folks out um it
 
02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:52.550 align:start position:0%
think could help some folks out um it
would

02:44:52.550 --> 02:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:44:55.309 --> 02:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
um it but it would be a modest
 
02:44:57.950 --> 02:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
Improvement to the system and if we have
 
02:44:59.510 --> 02:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
to wait on one or the other I'd rather
 
02:45:01.670 --> 02:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
wait on this one than the other
 
02:45:03.870 --> 02:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth would you uh
 
02:45:05.630 --> 02:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
would I be accurate in stating that the
 
02:45:08.950 --> 02:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
goal of the interim uh study here is not
 
02:45:12.309 --> 02:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
to trash it but to actually study it get
 
02:45:13.790 --> 02:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
the numbers and have an answer to this
 
02:45:17.150 --> 02:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:20.150 --> 02:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
I believe so and I'd like to add one
 
02:45:20.160 --> 02:45:22.469 align:start position:0%
I believe so and I'd like to add one
caveat

02:45:22.469 --> 02:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
caveat
 
02:45:25.710 --> 02:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
um that the sponsors of this bill were
 
02:45:28.070 --> 02:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
02:45:32.990 --> 02:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
address a specific problem
 
02:45:35.870 --> 02:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
that isn't necessarily addressed by
 
02:45:39.389 --> 02:45:39.399 align:start position:0%
simply raising the cap um and that had
 
02:45:44.750 --> 02:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
to do with uh so let's say I'm I'm
 
02:45:46.710 --> 02:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
getting my
 
02:45:51.269 --> 02:45:51.279 align:start position:0%
$427 a week and I take a parttime shift
 
02:45:53.710 --> 02:45:53.720 align:start position:0%
a friend of mine has a mini Mark so I
 
02:45:57.070 --> 02:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
take one shift I get $128 a week I get
 
02:45:59.830 --> 02:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
to keep that because it's under the cap
 
02:46:02.030 --> 02:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
the next week he says can you work two
 
02:46:05.590 --> 02:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
shifts I say sure don't mind in that
 
02:46:08.830 --> 02:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
case I'm going to lose every dollar I
 
02:46:13.830 --> 02:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
make coming out of of my check so I've
 
02:46:15.670 --> 02:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
worked now two shifts but I still make
 
02:46:18.309 --> 02:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
the same as when I work one ship the
 
02:46:20.269 --> 02:46:20.279 align:start position:0%
next week I might not know that because
 
02:46:21.830 --> 02:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
I've filled out my forms I've turned
 
02:46:23.230 --> 02:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
them in I don't know what's happening my
 
02:46:24.630 --> 02:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
check the next week he says you know
 
02:46:26.910 --> 02:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
what I that guy who was out he quit can
 
02:46:29.309 --> 02:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
you work four shifts this week and I'm
 
02:46:29.319 --> 02:46:30.309 align:start position:0%
you work four shifts this week and I'm
still

02:46:30.309 --> 02:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
still
 
02:46:33.190 --> 02:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
part-time I would now work four
 
02:46:35.790 --> 02:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
shifts and I wouldn't make a single
 
02:46:38.429 --> 02:46:38.439 align:start position:0%
penny more than when I work one and
 
02:46:42.110 --> 02:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
that's the problem that they sponsors
 
02:46:45.750 --> 02:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
asked us to look at this disincentive
 
02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
to work more and possibly and this is
 
02:46:50.389 --> 02:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
where where these numbers come in
 
02:46:52.429 --> 02:46:52.439 align:start position:0%
important possibly the the number of
 
02:46:54.830 --> 02:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
people that accidentally work more not
 
02:46:57.309 --> 02:46:57.319 align:start position:0%
realizing they're actually going to see
 
02:47:01.070 --> 02:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
less money overall once taxes and Social
 
02:47:04.190 --> 02:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
Security and Medicare gets calculated in
 
02:47:06.790 --> 02:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
simply raising the
 
02:47:11.630 --> 02:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
cap moves people out maybe fewer people
 
02:47:14.990 --> 02:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
are are affected by it but that point
 
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
where you keep working twice as many
 
02:47:19.349 --> 02:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
three times as many four times as many
 
02:47:22.349 --> 02:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
hours and you get nothing we're not even
 
02:47:27.309 --> 02:47:27.319 align:start position:0%
addressing that so that my long response
 
02:47:31.070 --> 02:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
is I I've never heard a short response
 
02:47:33.830 --> 02:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
no that each time I get a little longer
 
02:47:35.510 --> 02:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
and remember that next time you ask me a
 
02:47:39.630 --> 02:47:39.640 align:start position:0%
question um so this longer response
 
02:47:43.190 --> 02:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
is that when I'm proposing an interim
 
02:47:45.670 --> 02:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
study I'm hoping to address address more
 
02:47:48.230 --> 02:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
than just wait and run the numbers I'm
 
02:47:50.309 --> 02:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
hoping to address the concerns of the
 
02:47:52.710 --> 02:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
people who brought this bill for us and
 
02:47:56.070 --> 02:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
does it does it solve their problem
 
02:47:59.070 --> 02:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
adequately do they think it doesn't even
 
02:48:03.990 --> 02:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
address what they've put forth um so
 
02:48:06.950 --> 02:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
amending out their intent because we
 
02:48:09.469 --> 02:48:09.479 align:start position:0%
want to quickly act on this I think does
 
02:48:12.990 --> 02:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
as much a disservice to this bill
 
02:48:16.630 --> 02:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
as not addressing it within this term
 
02:48:18.030 --> 02:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative K Hill and
 
02:48:21.309 --> 02:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
avalani thank you Mr chair I I do uh
 
02:48:23.309 --> 02:48:23.319 align:start position:0%
agree with the information it' be
 
02:48:25.030 --> 02:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
helpful to have the data and I'm
 
02:48:27.190 --> 02:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
relieved to know that the plan is not to
 
02:48:29.349 --> 02:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
wait and see if it has Merit for next
 
02:48:31.950 --> 02:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
term because that would be
 
02:48:34.389 --> 02:48:34.399 align:start position:0%
disappointing uh however I'd also hope
 
02:48:37.429 --> 02:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
the deputy will find out how many people
 
02:48:40.190 --> 02:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
were in that situation where they worked
 
02:48:41.910 --> 02:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
a week worked two weeks and didn't get
 
02:48:43.790 --> 02:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
anything I think that's going to be a
 
02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
bit of an anomaly
 
02:48:48.550 --> 02:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
it should be yeah should know not to do
 
02:48:50.630 --> 02:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
that but so hopefully we can get this
 
02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
sorted out and do more than one thing at
 
02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:55.290 align:start position:0%
sorted out and do more than one thing at
once

02:48:55.290 --> 02:48:55.300 align:start position:0%
once
 
02:48:55.300 --> 02:48:56.910 align:start position:0%
once
[Music]

02:48:56.910 --> 02:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:49:00.790 --> 02:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman um
 
02:49:01.990 --> 02:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
I like the conversation that we were
 
02:49:03.110 --> 02:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
having and we're going to take a deeper
 
02:49:05.349 --> 02:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
look at this but for the Deputy
 
02:49:09.710 --> 02:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
Commissioner um at the 40% in our
 
02:49:09.720 --> 02:49:11.630 align:start position:0%
Commissioner um at the 40% in our
current

02:49:11.630 --> 02:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:49:16.670 --> 02:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
structure the phase is 128
 
02:49:18.670 --> 02:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
if we were to change that what would the
 
02:49:22.389 --> 02:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
phase be at the 40% at our higher end
 
02:49:24.429 --> 02:49:24.439 align:start position:0%
since more I'm guessing more people
 
02:49:27.710 --> 02:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
would be at that higher end
 
02:49:31.070 --> 02:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
to phase that and would with 35% maybe
 
02:49:34.429 --> 02:49:34.439 align:start position:0%
be the number we should look at for to
 
02:49:37.110 --> 02:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
balance the longevity with
 
02:49:40.510 --> 02:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
the amount being earned on the
 
02:49:44.389 --> 02:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
side no we didn't rehearse this right
 
02:49:47.910 --> 02:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
the math that I did because even though
 
02:49:50.510 --> 02:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
I had indicated I sought to avoid math
 
02:49:53.349 --> 02:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
by going to law school my father was my
 
02:49:56.790 --> 02:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
AP Kelk teacher so there is some math in
 
02:49:59.790 --> 02:49:59.800 align:start position:0%
there somewhere um but just quickly
 
02:50:04.110 --> 02:50:04.120 align:start position:0%
looking at the 30% disregard right now
 
02:50:06.469 --> 02:50:06.479 align:start position:0%
you're at that 427 Max you're allowed to
 
02:50:07.910 --> 02:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
keep the first
 
02:50:10.469 --> 02:50:10.479 align:start position:0%
$128 in earnings without any impact on
 
02:50:13.550 --> 02:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
your benefit if we move that Max benefit
 
02:50:18.110 --> 02:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
up to 66 9 uh then you'd be looking at
 
02:50:21.429 --> 02:50:21.439 align:start position:0%
$21 with our current 30% disregard is
 
02:50:23.309 --> 02:50:23.319 align:start position:0%
what you'd be able to keep without any
 
02:50:25.110 --> 02:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
impact so you'd have the 2011 in
 
02:50:28.790 --> 02:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
earnings plus the 669 in benefit if we
 
02:50:31.590 --> 02:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
increase that 40% disregard to increase
 
02:50:33.110 --> 02:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
the disregard to
 
02:50:37.269 --> 02:50:37.279 align:start position:0%
40% then um if our Max was still at
 
02:50:39.990 --> 02:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
$427 a week that person would be able to
 
02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.030 align:start position:0%
$427 a week that person would be able to
earn

02:50:42.030 --> 02:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
earn
 
02:50:45.190 --> 02:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
$171 without any impact and and if we
 
02:50:48.830 --> 02:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
increased the benefits to 669 that
 
02:50:51.110 --> 02:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
person would be able to earn uh
 
02:50:53.950 --> 02:50:53.960 align:start position:0%
267 without any impact on their
 
02:50:53.960 --> 02:50:55.429 align:start position:0%
267 without any impact on their
unemployment

02:50:55.429 --> 02:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
02:50:58.590 --> 02:50:58.600 align:start position:0%
benefit quick followup so the 267 is
 
02:51:00.590 --> 02:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
that a net takehome or is that again on
 
02:51:04.030 --> 02:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
their gross payments on they they report
 
02:51:07.309 --> 02:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
their gross thank you to us thank you
 
02:51:12.630 --> 02:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
Mr kale so again these maximums we we
 
02:51:14.870 --> 02:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
right now we have 60% of the people
 
02:51:17.030 --> 02:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
hitting the maximum if we raise that
 
02:51:18.429 --> 02:51:18.439 align:start position:0%
maximum that number is going to be quite
 
02:51:20.150 --> 02:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
a bit smaller
 
02:51:23.510 --> 02:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
correct correct um so right now you get
 
02:51:27.870 --> 02:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
60% of the claim filers in 2023 hit that
 
02:51:30.510 --> 02:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
427 um what we looked at with both the
 
02:51:32.630 --> 02:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
Senate and the house proposal uh you'd
 
02:51:36.510 --> 02:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
be looking at about 30% of claim filers
 
02:51:38.870 --> 02:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
hitting that that new Max so instead of
 
02:51:40.950 --> 02:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
4,000 people hitting the max you got
 
02:51:44.910 --> 02:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
2,000 people hitting the max follow so
 
02:51:46.750 --> 02:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
again the the the beauty of using a
 
02:51:49.790 --> 02:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
percentage is that as inflation or wages
 
02:51:52.269 --> 02:51:52.279 align:start position:0%
Rises and cost Rises it goes with it it
 
02:51:56.269 --> 02:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh it doesn't lag uh so this
 
02:51:59.389 --> 02:51:59.399 align:start position:0%
there some benefit to this change yes uh
 
02:52:02.309 --> 02:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
I think there's a there's benefit to
 
02:52:04.630 --> 02:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
keeping the percentage absolutely there
 
02:52:06.790 --> 02:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
are other States including uh Maine that
 
02:52:08.590 --> 02:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
do it as a flat dollar amount I think
 
02:52:12.070 --> 02:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
the percentage uh is a better way to go
 
02:52:14.830 --> 02:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
um so I you know keeping it as a
 
02:52:17.510 --> 02:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
percentage I would strongly encourage
 
02:52:17.520 --> 02:52:19.030 align:start position:0%
percentage I would strongly encourage
thank

02:52:19.030 --> 02:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:52:22.229 --> 02:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
you right we have a motion on the floor
 
02:52:25.269 --> 02:52:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:29.229 --> 02:52:29.239 align:start position:0%
study it's been moved and seconded by

study it's been moved and seconded by
don't

02:52:30.389 --> 02:52:30.399 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:52:34.429 --> 02:52:34.439 align:start position:0%
remember and cworth and Dro that's
 
02:52:38.429 --> 02:52:38.439 align:start position:0%

itl been moved by representative balani
 
02:54:05.750 --> 02:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
second by representative Granger you're
 
02:54:08.910 --> 02:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
uh recognized to speak to your motion
 
02:54:10.990 --> 02:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um this seeks to
 
02:54:14.790 --> 02:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
make several adjustments to um Severance
 
02:54:17.830 --> 02:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
agreements and
 
02:54:20.830 --> 02:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
um uh just for one side instead of both
 
02:54:23.870 --> 02:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
sides and we don't do that here thank
 
02:54:25.910 --> 02:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
you repres
 
02:54:27.950 --> 02:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
Sullivan not really sure what he just
 
02:54:27.960 --> 02:54:29.269 align:start position:0%
Sullivan not really sure what he just
said

02:54:29.269 --> 02:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:54:34.349 --> 02:54:34.359 align:start position:0%
but um the um I support the itl I I
 
02:54:36.309 --> 02:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
think this defeats the entire purpose of
 
02:54:40.469 --> 02:54:40.479 align:start position:0%
a severance agreement um and um uh
 
02:54:46.269 --> 02:54:46.279 align:start position:0%
therefore it ought not to happen
 
02:54:49.950 --> 02:54:49.960 align:start position:0%

you I guess I'll do

02:56:34.910 --> 02:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:38.590 --> 02:56:38.600 align:start position:0%
um um just to to see where it is I I
 
02:56:40.950 --> 02:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
still don't think
 
02:56:48.469 --> 02:56:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:50.309 --> 02:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll disc we'll discuss that any
 
02:56:54.630 --> 02:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:57.550 --> 02:56:57.560 align:start position:0%
uh finisher I was going to say stay back
 
02:56:58.710 --> 02:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
I was going to let everyone else who
 
02:57:02.510 --> 02:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
needs to go go and then um with with
 
02:57:05.590 --> 02:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
with regard to that um committee report
 
02:57:09.389 --> 02:57:09.399 align:start position:0%
on um representative McKenzie's bill it
 
02:57:11.590 --> 02:57:11.600 align:start position:0%
seems like the two rep
 
02:57:13.469 --> 02:57:13.479 align:start position:0%
reports I mean we are not in
 
02:57:15.309 --> 02:57:15.319 align:start position:0%
disagreement as to where we're going on
 
02:57:18.349 --> 02:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
this and
 
02:57:22.110 --> 02:57:22.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if uh we just put one
 
02:57:25.229 --> 02:57:25.239 align:start position:0%
report in um if if there's not a second
 
02:57:26.750 --> 02:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
report written it won't be
 
02:57:30.110 --> 02:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
printed I'm happy to do that I'll type
 
02:57:31.830 --> 02:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
it here and let you look at it make sure
 
02:57:34.910 --> 02:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
it's uh even with everybody uh with what
 
02:57:36.950 --> 02:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
we both agree on that that that sounds
 
02:57:38.950 --> 02:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
good I think it did because if there's
 
02:57:41.510 --> 02:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
two reports people will be reading them
 
02:57:43.030 --> 02:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
anticipating that they are in opposition
 
02:57:45.510 --> 02:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
to each other corre um and if we're not
 
02:57:48.269 --> 02:57:48.279 align:start position:0%
there then why confuse people
 
02:57:50.870 --> 02:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
understood kill uh would you like to
 
02:57:54.110 --> 02:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
take the same approach on 1178 that U an
 
02:57:56.469 --> 02:57:56.479 align:start position:0%
amendment is uh in progress and
 
02:57:59.950 --> 02:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
desirable and uh no real contest it's
 
02:58:06.630 --> 02:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:06.640 --> 02:58:08.429 align:start position:0%
 
found

02:58:08.429 --> 02:58:08.439 align:start position:0%
found
 
02:58:11.150 --> 02:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm thinking for a second I don't
 
02:58:12.910 --> 02:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
have a problem with it
 
02:58:16.990 --> 02:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
but is the goal to table this thing when
 
02:58:19.469 --> 02:58:19.479 align:start position:0%
we get to the floor if we don't have
 
02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's a different the goal is to have
 
02:58:24.910 --> 02:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
it done by then right okay that's fine
 
02:58:28.830 --> 02:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:31.229 --> 02:58:31.239 align:start position:0%
Mike any other before this committee
 
02:58:32.510 --> 02:58:32.520 align:start position:0%

the this itl
 
02:58:55.830 --> 02:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
report it better not say we're
 
02:58:57.389 --> 02:58:57.399 align:start position:0%
supporting an amendment that we haven't
 
02:58:59.990 --> 02:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
seen yet
 
02:59:02.670 --> 02:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
because that's what he wants he wants
 
02:59:04.229 --> 02:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
you to say oh we're going to come up
 
02:59:06.429 --> 02:59:06.439 align:start position:0%
with a better Amendment on that's the
 
02:59:08.269 --> 02:59:08.279 align:start position:0%
only reason
 
02:59:12.830 --> 02:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:12.840 --> 03:16:50.309 align:start position:0%
 
works

03:16:50.309 --> 03:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:53.750 --> 03:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
he's not on it it's the four of us
 
03:16:57.189 --> 03:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I thought it was Susi no that's the
 
03:16:58.950 --> 03:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
other one that's the other one what are
 
03:17:01.550 --> 03:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
you talking the one you scheduled for
 
03:17:06.030 --> 03:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
right now uh it's on the it's on the um
 
03:17:06.040 --> 03:17:09.389 align:start position:0%
right now uh it's on the it's on the um
yes

03:17:09.389 --> 03:17:09.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:09.399 --> 03:17:10.990 align:start position:0%
 
oh

wonderful and
 
03:17:19.030 --> 03:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
um if you were representative kahill
 
03:17:21.870 --> 03:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
hoping to talk about the discussion that
 
03:17:23.670 --> 03:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
you had in the email you're welcome to
 
03:17:27.309 --> 03:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:32.550 --> 03:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
us all right thank you um so I think
 
03:17:35.510 --> 03:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
where we stand with
 
03:17:37.510 --> 03:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
this with this
 
03:17:37.520 --> 03:17:39.630 align:start position:0%
this with this
bill

03:17:39.630 --> 03:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:17:42.830 --> 03:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
is I put in a number
 
03:17:44.710 --> 03:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
um which would
 
03:17:49.550 --> 03:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
raise the the limit from 300 to
 
03:17:52.550 --> 03:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
3,000 and we're trying to answer the
 
03:17:56.590 --> 03:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
question is is that the right number is
 
03:17:58.150 --> 03:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
there a better number we can come up
 
03:18:02.670 --> 03:18:02.680 align:start position:0%
with um I would also uh be interested if
 
03:18:05.630 --> 03:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
anybody has an opinion one or two
 
03:18:07.590 --> 03:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
members mentioned that maybe it
 
03:18:11.269 --> 03:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a fixed dollar number but
 
03:18:14.830 --> 03:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
uh somehow related
 
03:18:18.349 --> 03:18:18.359 align:start position:0%
to a pay period or or something like
 
03:18:20.309 --> 03:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
that so those are the kind of
 
03:18:22.670 --> 03:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
discussions I think we want to have and
 
03:18:26.389 --> 03:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
at the end of it um come up with a
 
03:18:28.710 --> 03:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation um either for a new
 
03:18:31.990 --> 03:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
dollar number a new approach for
 
03:18:33.790 --> 03:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
calculating it
 
03:18:37.309 --> 03:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
or or no change whats we could leave it
 
03:18:41.830 --> 03:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
as it is um we could if the idea is that
 
03:18:43.750 --> 03:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
leave leaving it as it is does nothing
 
03:18:46.550 --> 03:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
and we want to no no okay that's not
 
03:18:48.830 --> 03:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
what I meant I said I meant no change
 
03:18:53.269 --> 03:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
leave the bill as it is yes y so um
 
03:18:55.070 --> 03:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm hoping to get to today
 
03:18:56.790 --> 03:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
I will start because I see the
 
03:18:58.990 --> 03:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
department is here did you have
 
03:19:03.429 --> 03:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
information that you wanted to uh
 
03:19:11.030 --> 03:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:11.040 --> 03:19:12.590 align:start position:0%
 
because

03:19:12.590 --> 03:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:19:15.189 --> 03:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
if you have questions for us and you
 
03:19:17.030 --> 03:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
know what I'm going to start with a
 
03:19:20.910 --> 03:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
question to you because I had
 
03:19:24.429 --> 03:19:24.439 align:start position:0%
um I was having a discussion earlier and
 
03:19:26.670 --> 03:19:26.680 align:start position:0%
I think I know what the answer is but I
 
03:19:28.950 --> 03:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
didn't agree with the person asking it
 
03:19:34.429 --> 03:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
so in the the way the law is written
 
03:19:36.670 --> 03:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
and let me see if I
 
03:19:40.630 --> 03:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
can yeah
 
03:19:45.070 --> 03:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
um so it says that the the wages
 
03:19:48.950 --> 03:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
due are paid by the employer not in
 
03:19:52.630 --> 03:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
excess of and let's just use the 3,000
 
03:19:55.150 --> 03:19:55.160 align:start position:0%
so not in excess of 3,000 May upon
 
03:19:57.990 --> 03:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
proper demand be played in paid in the
 
03:20:00.910 --> 03:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
absence of actual notice of the pendency
 
03:20:02.830 --> 03:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
of prodate
 
03:20:05.150 --> 03:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
proceedings and the question somebody
 
03:20:08.990 --> 03:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
asked is what happens if it's over 3,000
 
03:20:10.950 --> 03:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
03:20:10.960 --> 03:20:12.750 align:start position:0%
so it's
$3,100

03:20:12.750 --> 03:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
$3,100
 
03:20:14.670 --> 03:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
I would say then you
 
03:20:18.750 --> 03:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
can't you can't pay it it has to the
 
03:20:20.990 --> 03:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
whole amount has to go to
 
03:20:24.269 --> 03:20:24.279 align:start position:0%
probate the other opinion was that the
 
03:20:27.389 --> 03:20:27.399 align:start position:0%
employer can pay $3,000 and anything in
 
03:20:30.830 --> 03:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
excess of that has to go to probate and
 
03:20:33.349 --> 03:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
it's really a question of the exist this
 
03:20:36.389 --> 03:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
isn't this is the existing language so
 
03:20:39.590 --> 03:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
the question isn't even what I intended
 
03:20:41.510 --> 03:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
or or what I thought I was doing it's
 
03:20:43.510 --> 03:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
how does has the
 
03:20:48.150 --> 03:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:51.550 --> 03:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
years oh I'm sorry I'm stretching red
 
03:20:53.349 --> 03:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
light means on all right I'm not I'm
 
03:20:55.950 --> 03:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
terrible with the technology um you know
 
03:20:58.309 --> 03:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
one first and foremost in engaging with
 
03:21:00.510 --> 03:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
our Inspection Division and I believe
 
03:21:02.630 --> 03:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
that uh attorney McGrath had testified
 
03:21:03.910 --> 03:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
to this over the course of the public
 
03:21:05.349 --> 03:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
hearing the Department's interaction
 
03:21:07.830 --> 03:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
with the statatory section is relatively
 
03:21:11.189 --> 03:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
light we don't get a lot of calls uh
 
03:21:13.189 --> 03:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
questioning it or asking about its
 
03:21:15.550 --> 03:21:15.560 align:start position:0%
meaning or its interpretation by and
 
03:21:17.189 --> 03:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
large typically when the department is
 
03:21:18.750 --> 03:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
hearing from the public about this
 
03:21:20.750 --> 03:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
particular provision it's coming from
 
03:21:24.950 --> 03:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
employers who are um kind of inquiring
 
03:21:26.870 --> 03:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
can I do this um and I'm sorry I'm
 
03:21:28.030 --> 03:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
Danielle Albert I'm the Deputy
 
03:21:29.510 --> 03:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioner for the Department I just
 
03:21:31.150 --> 03:21:31.160 align:start position:0%
launched into answering your question so
 
03:21:33.429 --> 03:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
my apologies for the lack of uh
 
03:21:36.229 --> 03:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
introduction um you know I think the
 
03:21:38.229 --> 03:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
statutory language right now is clear
 
03:21:39.590 --> 03:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
whether you're looking at the $300 or
 
03:21:41.910 --> 03:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
the $3,000 language that there's a cap
 
03:21:43.389 --> 03:21:43.399 align:start position:0%
there's a limit to the amount that the
 
03:21:45.750 --> 03:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
employer is supposed to be paying out
 
03:21:47.870 --> 03:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
right now it's 300 you're proposing
 
03:21:50.429 --> 03:21:50.439 align:start position:0%
3,000 um anything in excess of that it's
 
03:21:52.229 --> 03:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
a good question you know it might be one
 
03:21:54.349 --> 03:21:54.359 align:start position:0%
that's worth the department researching
 
03:21:56.269 --> 03:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
a little bit I'm not that familiar with
 
03:21:58.750 --> 03:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
intest toy proceedings or the probate
 
03:22:00.429 --> 03:22:00.439 align:start position:0%
proceedings are not intimately familiar
 
03:22:02.550 --> 03:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
enough to say whether or not there's an
 
03:22:05.229 --> 03:22:05.239 align:start position:0%
interplay there between the two statutes
 
03:22:06.750 --> 03:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
that if you're going in advance of that
 
03:22:08.469 --> 03:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
amount does the whole thing have to go
 
03:22:11.910 --> 03:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
over or or is it only the amount in
 
03:22:13.429 --> 03:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
excess of I think certainly it would
 
03:22:15.670 --> 03:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
seem the way that the current language
 
03:22:17.950 --> 03:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
is structured anything in excess of
 
03:22:20.590 --> 03:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
would be steered towards the probate
 
03:22:20.600 --> 03:22:22.510 align:start position:0%
would be steered towards the probate
proceeding

03:22:22.510 --> 03:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
03:22:25.990 --> 03:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
um and if there's a proper demand of the
 
03:22:30.150 --> 03:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
payment uh from the person who is asking
 
03:22:31.830 --> 03:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
the employer to make the payment then
 
03:22:33.389 --> 03:22:33.399 align:start position:0%
the amount would be kept at the ceiling
 
03:22:35.910 --> 03:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
that the statute has set um do you read
 
03:22:37.510 --> 03:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
that the same way attorney McGrath
 
03:22:39.070 --> 03:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
that's actually pretty much how I
 
03:22:41.429 --> 03:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
testified before um with very little
 
03:22:44.269 --> 03:22:44.279 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the probate system you can
 
03:22:46.950 --> 03:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
have anything in excess if that's
 
03:22:51.189 --> 03:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
allowed can be put towards the estate so
 
03:22:54.189 --> 03:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
um I I'm reading it the same way that
 
03:22:56.790 --> 03:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner is all right and
 
03:23:00.229 --> 03:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
just to be clear I think I understood so
 
03:23:02.189 --> 03:23:02.199 align:start position:0%
the question is not what happens to the
 
03:23:04.950 --> 03:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
excess but what happens to what's not an
 
03:23:07.469 --> 03:23:07.479 align:start position:0%
excess if it is an excess so I'm owed a
 
03:23:10.309 --> 03:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
million dollars on this massive sales
 
03:23:12.429 --> 03:23:12.439 align:start position:0%
commission and I
 
03:23:16.189 --> 03:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
and um that's all and that's another
 
03:23:19.830 --> 03:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
question so that's all going to probate
 
03:23:22.790 --> 03:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
so can I go in and say give me 3,000
 
03:23:25.630 --> 03:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
right now or does the rest of the
 
03:23:28.429 --> 03:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
language the way it says that in the
 
03:23:30.469 --> 03:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
absence of actual notice of dependency
 
03:23:33.510 --> 03:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
appr probate proceedings
 
03:23:37.790 --> 03:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
mean that you shouldn't be giving me any
 
03:23:43.830 --> 03:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:46.189 --> 03:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
of and to be clear I'm I'm now
 
03:23:48.269 --> 03:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
pretending to be not the dead employee
 
03:23:54.950 --> 03:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:58.750 --> 03:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
the in other words it is that it it
 
03:24:00.750 --> 03:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
sounds like to me the way I read it the
 
03:24:03.590 --> 03:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
way it's written is you can't give
 
03:24:06.150 --> 03:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
somebody even some money if there's a
 
03:24:07.870 --> 03:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
probate proceeding that should be
 
03:24:10.389 --> 03:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
handling it I think if if it if it's
 
03:24:13.349 --> 03:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
underway and that that also that that
 
03:24:16.229 --> 03:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
language pendency of probate proceedings
 
03:24:18.389 --> 03:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
might make a difference whether the
 
03:24:21.950 --> 03:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
employer is triggering it because
 
03:24:23.710 --> 03:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
there's now this big amount of money
 
03:24:25.030 --> 03:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
that says well this is going to have to
 
03:24:27.830 --> 03:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
go to probate versus the probate has
 
03:24:30.710 --> 03:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
already begun for another reason in
 
03:24:30.720 --> 03:24:32.429 align:start position:0%
already begun for another reason in
which

03:24:32.429 --> 03:24:32.439 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:24:35.030 --> 03:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
case if it's already begun the employer
 
03:24:36.990 --> 03:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
can't turn over anything if it hasn't
 
03:24:40.110 --> 03:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
begun the employer can turn over up to
 
03:24:43.189 --> 03:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
$3,000 and then the the rest goes over
 
03:24:45.510 --> 03:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
or does this say you know what it's
 
03:24:47.469 --> 03:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
either it's either probate or it's not
 
03:24:49.229 --> 03:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
probate and if it's not
 
03:24:49.239 --> 03:24:51.389 align:start position:0%
probate and if it's not
probate

03:24:51.389 --> 03:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
probate
 
03:24:53.950 --> 03:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
then as long as the amounts doe are
 
03:24:53.960 --> 03:24:54.830 align:start position:0%
then as long as the amounts doe are
under

03:24:54.830 --> 03:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
under
 
03:24:57.630 --> 03:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
$3,000 you can go with
 
03:25:00.670 --> 03:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
it but if it is probate then everything
 
03:25:03.750 --> 03:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
goes through the probate process I think
 
03:25:05.830 --> 03:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
that's a fair reading under the rules of
 
03:25:09.309 --> 03:25:09.319 align:start position:0%
statutory construction um if it is okay
 
03:25:11.990 --> 03:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
with the committee I would wouldn't mind
 
03:25:14.070 --> 03:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
taking it back to just digest I think it
 
03:25:16.870 --> 03:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
really and I'm not trying to sound
 
03:25:19.110 --> 03:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
grossly lawyerly over it I think it
 
03:25:20.830 --> 03:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
depends on the placement of the commas
 
03:25:23.309 --> 03:25:23.319 align:start position:0%
and what it's modifying um I think
 
03:25:26.389 --> 03:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
that's accurate that if there is in the
 
03:25:28.229 --> 03:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
absence of notice of the pendency of a
 
03:25:30.229 --> 03:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
probate proceeding I.E if that has been
 
03:25:33.590 --> 03:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
brought forward probate um if not then
 
03:25:36.189 --> 03:25:36.199 align:start position:0%
there's a a ceilinged amount that can be
 
03:25:39.229 --> 03:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
paid out without the letters of test
 
03:25:41.110 --> 03:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
testamentary or administration of the
 
03:25:43.429 --> 03:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
following following the list of deed
 
03:25:45.110 --> 03:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
that are set forth in the
 
03:25:45.120 --> 03:25:46.870 align:start position:0%
that are set forth in the
intestin

03:25:46.870 --> 03:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
intestin
 
03:25:50.110 --> 03:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
laws which I'm St under the current
 
03:25:51.389 --> 03:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
language under the current language that
 
03:25:53.870 --> 03:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at right now um so I think
 
03:25:56.110 --> 03:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
that reading you know that reading I
 
03:25:57.429 --> 03:25:57.439 align:start position:0%
believe is accurate again our
 
03:25:59.229 --> 03:25:59.239 align:start position:0%
interaction with an application of it is
 
03:26:00.950 --> 03:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
so limited because it does not come up
 
03:26:02.349 --> 03:26:02.359 align:start position:0%
as an Enforcement issue for the
 
03:26:04.990 --> 03:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
Department um so if you're okay with
 
03:26:07.070 --> 03:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
that I wouldn't mind taking a slightly
 
03:26:08.269 --> 03:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
close closer look and then perhaps
 
03:26:09.590 --> 03:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
following up in writing and just
 
03:26:12.070 --> 03:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
verifying yes that's the application
 
03:26:14.229 --> 03:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
and and we haven't scheduled this
 
03:26:18.429 --> 03:26:18.439 align:start position:0%
executive session yet so we have plenty
 
03:26:20.189 --> 03:26:20.199 align:start position:0%
of time to
 
03:26:23.349 --> 03:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
get information from the department and
 
03:26:25.590 --> 03:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
even if our subcommittee is done we can
 
03:26:27.990 --> 03:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
use that to make further Amendment um
 
03:26:31.110 --> 03:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
and I've got a question the
 
03:26:34.150 --> 03:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
um I read that to mean it's a cap and
 
03:26:36.349 --> 03:26:36.359 align:start position:0%
you get you can get your $3,000 no
 
03:26:38.710 --> 03:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
matter how big the paycheck is um how
 
03:26:43.070 --> 03:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
much bigger the paycheck is um the piece
 
03:26:45.990 --> 03:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
that um I want to check on is the uh
 
03:26:50.110 --> 03:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
lines five and six um the the current
 
03:26:52.750 --> 03:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
language reads in the following order of
 
03:26:54.670 --> 03:26:54.680 align:start position:0%
preference to The Descendants in
 
03:26:58.790 --> 03:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
accordance with the laws of iny in
 
03:27:01.950 --> 03:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
inest intestacy for the State of New
 
03:27:04.269 --> 03:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that's being replaced with
 
03:27:06.309 --> 03:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
with payment made um the order of
 
03:27:09.229 --> 03:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
distribution set forth in RSA 5 561
 
03:27:12.150 --> 03:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
colon 1 and I did look at that um during
 
03:27:16.429 --> 03:27:16.439 align:start position:0%
the hearing um I was a tad troubled by
 
03:27:20.910 --> 03:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
it because it's um it's a very
 
03:27:24.349 --> 03:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
uh it's not easy to follow uh
 
03:27:27.990 --> 03:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
561 um and I was concerned that um I
 
03:27:29.550 --> 03:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
think there was a comment made that
 
03:27:31.349 --> 03:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
you'd have to be an expert in Probate to
 
03:27:34.550 --> 03:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
do some of the stuff when I read 56 I
 
03:27:36.750 --> 03:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
said yeah you'd have to be and I'm
 
03:27:38.309 --> 03:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
trying to figure
 
03:27:41.630 --> 03:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
out is that if that's the way way it's
 
03:27:43.469 --> 03:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
always been then I guess that's the way
 
03:27:45.150 --> 03:27:45.160 align:start position:0%
it's always been and I have
 
03:27:48.150 --> 03:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
no I have some concerns but I guess I
 
03:27:50.070 --> 03:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
can live with leaving at the way it is
 
03:27:53.070 --> 03:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
but I don't know if the current phrase
 
03:27:57.590 --> 03:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
is equivalent to the proposed
 
03:28:01.269 --> 03:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
phrase well I'm not an expert in the
 
03:28:03.469 --> 03:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
laws of intestacy either and you do have
 
03:28:06.750 --> 03:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
to be a specialized uh practician to go
 
03:28:08.590 --> 03:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
into any type of a state and probate if
 
03:28:11.309 --> 03:28:11.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to be any good at it um but
 
03:28:13.910 --> 03:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
I did take a look a little bit at
 
03:28:20.510 --> 03:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
5611 and um it it requires a a lot of
 
03:28:23.349 --> 03:28:23.359 align:start position:0%
help trying to understand uh so the
 
03:28:25.830 --> 03:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
breakdown what I think I'd like to do is
 
03:28:27.870 --> 03:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
take a look and see whether or not this
 
03:28:29.469 --> 03:28:29.479 align:start position:0%
basically mirrors the same thing and
 
03:28:32.189 --> 03:28:32.199 align:start position:0%
it's just shortening the distribution
 
03:28:34.229 --> 03:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
schedule by just stating the statute as
 
03:28:36.510 --> 03:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to stating following the laws of
 
03:28:39.710 --> 03:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
intestacy which could could be 561 is
 
03:28:42.790 --> 03:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
that it it it would be best to take a
 
03:28:45.030 --> 03:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
look at it because that is not my area
 
03:28:46.950 --> 03:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
of practice and and I believe Deputy
 
03:28:49.229 --> 03:28:49.239 align:start position:0%
Commissioner admitted the same um it
 
03:28:50.510 --> 03:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
would be best to take a look at it to
 
03:28:51.990 --> 03:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
see whether or not basically we're
 
03:28:56.630 --> 03:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
replacing one um line with another
 
03:28:59.429 --> 03:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
that's exactly the same the only thing
 
03:29:01.349 --> 03:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
that I would say I'm sorry no no I'm
 
03:29:03.389 --> 03:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
sorry the only thing that I would say is
 
03:29:05.309 --> 03:29:05.319 align:start position:0%
that if it turns out and again I would
 
03:29:06.590 --> 03:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
like to take a look at it but if it
 
03:29:09.030 --> 03:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
turns out that
 
03:29:12.469 --> 03:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
5611 actually ref refers you exactly to
 
03:29:15.150 --> 03:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
the section that describes uh
 
03:29:17.469 --> 03:29:17.479 align:start position:0%
testamentary uh progression airs and
 
03:29:19.950 --> 03:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
things like that it might be easier to
 
03:29:23.030 --> 03:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
look at right knowing what the statutory
 
03:29:25.229 --> 03:29:25.239 align:start position:0%
uh reference is as opposed to just the
 
03:29:26.990 --> 03:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
language that was in it before yeah
 
03:29:28.710 --> 03:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
because B basically an employer might
 
03:29:30.750 --> 03:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
just uh read that not really know quite
 
03:29:33.389 --> 03:29:33.399 align:start position:0%
what it means and say I just I guess we
 
03:29:35.510 --> 03:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
just give it all to the wife if it all
 
03:29:38.150 --> 03:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
turns out to be exactly the same having
 
03:29:39.750 --> 03:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
that reference makes them do a little
 
03:29:41.189 --> 03:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
extra work to make sure that what
 
03:29:43.189 --> 03:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
they're doing is correct I mean but the
 
03:29:44.630 --> 03:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
but the average employer probably will
 
03:29:46.189 --> 03:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
freak out when they read
 
03:29:52.670 --> 03:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
561 um but uh and to the sponsor um did
 
03:29:54.870 --> 03:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
OS come up with that idea all on their
 
03:29:59.429 --> 03:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
own no they were prompted by me and I'll
 
03:30:02.150 --> 03:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
go back uh Deputy Commissioner you were
 
03:30:04.309 --> 03:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
the one who sent the email suggesting we
 
03:30:07.630 --> 03:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
look at it and if I recall part of the
 
03:30:09.670 --> 03:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
problem was that employers looked at
 
03:30:11.590 --> 03:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
words like
 
03:30:15.670 --> 03:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
intestacy and letters of testamentary or
 
03:30:17.670 --> 03:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
of administration and pendency of
 
03:30:19.510 --> 03:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
probate and they said I don't know what
 
03:30:21.710 --> 03:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at and that that how this
 
03:30:23.910 --> 03:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
got flagged was the number of calls that
 
03:30:27.070 --> 03:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
you got on this so this was actually my
 
03:30:29.150 --> 03:30:29.160 align:start position:0%
second draft I had already done the top
 
03:30:32.309 --> 03:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
part and I was thinking boy that it says
 
03:30:35.389 --> 03:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
with the laws of intestin intestacy for
 
03:30:38.070 --> 03:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire well surely
 
03:30:41.070 --> 03:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
those laws are written down somewhere so
 
03:30:46.269 --> 03:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
so I asked OSS can could you refer to
 
03:30:48.429 --> 03:30:48.439 align:start position:0%
those by reference rather than by
 
03:30:51.670 --> 03:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
description so a it's it's clear what we
 
03:30:54.950 --> 03:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
mean and B that someone who doesn't
 
03:30:56.510 --> 03:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
understand what this language is can go
 
03:31:00.389 --> 03:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
and look at up and so OSS thinks okay so
 
03:31:03.990 --> 03:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
they they they identify 561 as the the
 
03:31:06.830 --> 03:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
laws of intestines right so um now we
 
03:31:09.030 --> 03:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
just want to know if they're right right
 
03:31:13.150 --> 03:31:13.160 align:start position:0%
that could use a second opinion and if
 
03:31:15.710 --> 03:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
if it turns out that this the two aren't
 
03:31:18.590 --> 03:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
equivalent my intention was to make it
 
03:31:22.670 --> 03:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
exactly equivalent replace it not in
 
03:31:26.349 --> 03:31:26.359 align:start position:0%
function but with clearer language for
 
03:31:26.359 --> 03:31:27.349 align:start position:0%
function but with clearer language for
the

03:31:27.349 --> 03:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:31:30.189 --> 03:31:30.199 align:start position:0%
average employer the law is not clear
 
03:31:32.630 --> 03:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
language and the law is not clear but
 
03:31:34.670 --> 03:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
the point is you have to follow the law
 
03:31:38.830 --> 03:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
such as it is it is what it is yeah um
 
03:31:41.870 --> 03:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
and then for the record um
 
03:31:44.630 --> 03:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
I did a calculation
 
03:31:47.349 --> 03:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
and if you make the Assumption which and
 
03:31:50.550 --> 03:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
it is an assumption that um someone is
 
03:31:52.309 --> 03:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
being paid um
 
03:31:54.389 --> 03:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
bi-weekly um and that one of those
 
03:31:58.990 --> 03:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
bi-weekly checks is um what the employer
 
03:32:01.469 --> 03:32:01.479 align:start position:0%
is trying to pass on to somebody a
 
03:32:05.349 --> 03:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
$33,000 um um payroll would would be um
 
03:32:07.950 --> 03:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
someone who was earning approximately
 
03:32:11.590 --> 03:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
$78,000 um which to me
 
03:32:14.389 --> 03:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
sounds okay um you know somebody who's
 
03:32:16.670 --> 03:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
earning about you know under
 
03:32:16.680 --> 03:32:18.309 align:start position:0%
earning about you know under
$100,000

03:32:18.309 --> 03:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
$100,000
 
03:32:21.670 --> 03:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
um and and you know at least $3,000 is
 
03:32:24.790 --> 03:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
worth thinking about I suspect that
 
03:32:28.030 --> 03:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
people don't bother with the 300 um the
 
03:32:30.349 --> 03:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
employers don't perhaps don't know about
 
03:32:33.309 --> 03:32:33.319 align:start position:0%
it and don't do it um but once you get
 
03:32:35.110 --> 03:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
to 3,000 I think it's it's it's worth
 
03:32:37.830 --> 03:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
having it's a chunk of a funeral expense
 
03:32:39.550 --> 03:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:32:42.910 --> 03:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm okay with 3,000 as a dollar
 
03:32:45.510 --> 03:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
amount and the other thing that I looked
 
03:32:48.710 --> 03:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
at again to to gut check the
 
03:32:52.269 --> 03:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
3,000 is what that is relative to the
 
03:32:56.630 --> 03:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
average wage in New Hampshire and it's
 
03:33:01.990 --> 03:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
um for it's like three and a half weeks
 
03:33:03.830 --> 03:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
I guess whether you're doing the mean or
 
03:33:06.670 --> 03:33:06.680 align:start position:0%
the median is is closer to three or or
 
03:33:08.429 --> 03:33:08.439 align:start position:0%
closer to three and a half depending on
 
03:33:10.830 --> 03:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
which average you use but again that
 
03:33:12.349 --> 03:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
tells me
 
03:33:17.030 --> 03:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
that the bulk or let's say 2/3 of wage
 
03:33:20.349 --> 03:33:20.359 align:start position:0%
earners would have either a weekly or a
 
03:33:23.309 --> 03:33:23.319 align:start position:0%
bi-weekly check covered under the
 
03:33:28.670 --> 03:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
3,000 and to me that felt right that it
 
03:33:32.750 --> 03:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
gets most of the wage earners covered um
 
03:33:35.189 --> 03:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
and it's only when you're in that upper
 
03:33:39.750 --> 03:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
portion that um You' run into the
 
03:33:39.760 --> 03:33:42.590 align:start position:0%
portion that um You' run into the
cab

03:33:42.590 --> 03:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
cab
 
03:33:44.429 --> 03:33:44.439 align:start position:0%
I've been involved with two probate
 
03:33:45.990 --> 03:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
cases where I was the executive and I do
 
03:33:48.070 --> 03:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of probate why don't you turn that
 
03:33:50.830 --> 03:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
on in case people are going to watch the
 
03:33:53.950 --> 03:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
video the video I don't know they
 
03:33:55.389 --> 03:33:55.399 align:start position:0%
probably are recording
 
03:33:58.150 --> 03:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
us uh I've been executive of two
 
03:34:00.469 --> 03:34:00.479 align:start position:0%
Estates and I do a lot of probate stuff
 
03:34:04.349 --> 03:34:04.359 align:start position:0%
in my job and I can tell you that it
 
03:34:07.870 --> 03:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
takes a good two or three weeks if not
 
03:34:10.950 --> 03:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
more sometimes a month and a half the
 
03:34:12.910 --> 03:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
time someone passes away and you deal
 
03:34:15.429 --> 03:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
with the issues at hand of dealing with
 
03:34:19.710 --> 03:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
the person and the family um and then
 
03:34:22.150 --> 03:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
you have to go to probate even if their
 
03:34:24.550 --> 03:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
will says it won't be probated you have
 
03:34:26.110 --> 03:34:26.120 align:start position:0%
to at least go to a probate judge to
 
03:34:27.550 --> 03:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
have them look at the will that says it
 
03:34:29.030 --> 03:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
will not be
 
03:34:31.630 --> 03:34:31.640 align:start position:0%
probated because of the Fairbanks case
 
03:34:33.830 --> 03:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
of 30 40 years ago when someone took
 
03:34:36.150 --> 03:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
judge Fairbanks took off of everybody's
 
03:34:39.349 --> 03:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
money um they usually make you post a
 
03:34:41.150 --> 03:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
bond in order to post a bond Bond even
 
03:34:43.630 --> 03:34:43.640 align:start position:0%
if it's a minimum $33,000 bond which
 
03:34:45.950 --> 03:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
only cost $100 but it's what most judges
 
03:34:48.990 --> 03:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
make you do uh someone has to apply for
 
03:34:51.710 --> 03:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
that someone has to be financially
 
03:34:54.389 --> 03:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
creditworthy to get the bond we've had
 
03:34:56.229 --> 03:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
situations where the executive listed in
 
03:35:00.309 --> 03:35:00.319 align:start position:0%
the will or the uh some other family
 
03:35:02.309 --> 03:35:02.319 align:start position:0%
member does not qualify have to go back
 
03:35:04.710 --> 03:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
so you're talking six weeks eight weeks
 
03:35:07.510 --> 03:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
then the the the the the lawyer has to
 
03:35:09.229 --> 03:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
be engaged and that's going to cost a
 
03:35:11.550 --> 03:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar or whatever so
 
03:35:14.990 --> 03:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not so concerned about when you say
 
03:35:18.309 --> 03:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
well what's the line of who's going to
 
03:35:23.070 --> 03:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
get what okay uh because that $3,000 is
 
03:35:24.830 --> 03:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
not going to be part of any anyone's
 
03:35:27.189 --> 03:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
bequeaths or anyone's will uh
 
03:35:29.030 --> 03:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
instructions that's going to take care
 
03:35:30.550 --> 03:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
of what it takes to get through the
 
03:35:33.070 --> 03:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
court system through probate and God
 
03:35:35.550 --> 03:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
forbid if you don't have person doesn't
 
03:35:37.510 --> 03:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
have any money to bury them or to
 
03:35:39.950 --> 03:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
cremate them or anything else so I'm not
 
03:35:41.630 --> 03:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
overly concerned concern with the 3,000
 
03:35:43.189 --> 03:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
someone saying and being overly
 
03:35:45.870 --> 03:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
concerned with um who's going to get
 
03:35:47.349 --> 03:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
what percentage based on whatever the
 
03:35:49.710 --> 03:35:49.720 align:start position:0%
will says because trust me
 
03:35:52.790 --> 03:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
$3,000 um is going to have to go to
 
03:35:55.070 --> 03:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
those other expenses associated with it
 
03:35:56.710 --> 03:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
and if you don't have any money which
 
03:35:58.630 --> 03:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
I've had these cases before where
 
03:36:01.429 --> 03:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
someone says we don't have any money we
 
03:36:05.110 --> 03:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
can't pay you the100 $500 for the bond
 
03:36:06.950 --> 03:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
we can't even pay the attorney to get
 
03:36:09.070 --> 03:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
them until we get some money well you
 
03:36:10.550 --> 03:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
can't get some money until you get the
 
03:36:11.830 --> 03:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
attorney and the bond and go to the
 
03:36:15.469 --> 03:36:15.479 align:start position:0%
court so sometimes it's it's uh you know
 
03:36:17.910 --> 03:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
the cart before the horse and
 
03:36:20.469 --> 03:36:20.479 align:start position:0%
um so I'm okay with the
 
03:36:22.990 --> 03:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
$3,000 you're not suggesting that $3,000
 
03:36:24.830 --> 03:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
will go to probate
 
03:36:27.630 --> 03:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
though no it'll have to be dealt with in
 
03:36:29.790 --> 03:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
the Probate Court it has to be in the
 
03:36:32.750 --> 03:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
first um when it comes to the
 
03:36:36.510 --> 03:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
um when you have to fill out um
 
03:36:38.550 --> 03:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
inventory thank you the inventory
 
03:36:41.229 --> 03:36:41.239 align:start position:0%
paperwork has the assets and liabilities
 
03:36:44.229 --> 03:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
but what this what this says is that
 
03:36:46.790 --> 03:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
before um there's a notice of pendency
 
03:36:49.630 --> 03:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
of probate proceedings the 3,000 can be
 
03:36:51.750 --> 03:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
paid out so the way I read this is you
 
03:36:53.710 --> 03:36:53.720 align:start position:0%
get your $3,000 check without even going
 
03:36:55.389 --> 03:36:55.399 align:start position:0%
anywhere near probate and I'm saying
 
03:36:57.910 --> 03:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's good okay because you need that
 
03:36:59.910 --> 03:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to start the probate case in
 
03:37:04.670 --> 03:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of circumstances now that money
 
03:37:08.670 --> 03:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
will have to be allocated in you know
 
03:37:11.269 --> 03:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
that was received because it is an asset
 
03:37:13.229 --> 03:37:13.239 align:start position:0%
so once you do the probate after you've
 
03:37:14.710 --> 03:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
done the inventory and you have to start
 
03:37:16.309 --> 03:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
doing the accounting of the income and
 
03:37:19.510 --> 03:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
the expenses yeah it'll show up there
 
03:37:22.229 --> 03:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
okay uh but I I heard it concerned about
 
03:37:23.229 --> 03:37:23.239 align:start position:0%
well you
 
03:37:26.469 --> 03:37:26.479 align:start position:0%
know the favorite son gets uh 50% and
 
03:37:29.469 --> 03:37:29.479 align:start position:0%
the unfavored son gets 25 and and the
 
03:37:31.469 --> 03:37:31.479 align:start position:0%
whatever really unfavored son only gets
 
03:37:34.830 --> 03:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
25 of that $33,000 trust me that's not
 
03:37:37.070 --> 03:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
going to you know I don't think those
 
03:37:38.349 --> 03:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
those fights are going to happen because
 
03:37:40.110 --> 03:37:40.120 align:start position:0%
there's all the other things that are
 
03:37:41.630 --> 03:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
much more important that have to be
 
03:37:43.070 --> 03:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
dealt with than someone getting a the
 
03:37:43.990 --> 03:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
quest of
 
03:37:46.670 --> 03:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
aate the trick will simply be somebody
 
03:37:48.590 --> 03:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
figuring out with
 
03:37:50.710 --> 03:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
561 who's supposed to get the money in
 
03:37:52.309 --> 03:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
accordance with
 
03:37:54.510 --> 03:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
561 um
 
03:37:57.349 --> 03:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
and that might be the first task of the
 
03:37:58.590 --> 03:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
attorney that they're eventually going
 
03:38:00.830 --> 03:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
to have to hire um and then the attorney
 
03:38:02.349 --> 03:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
will take the
 
03:38:05.309 --> 03:38:05.319 align:start position:0%
$3,000 yes and that was in
 
03:38:09.070 --> 03:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
representative kill talked to um I think
 
03:38:11.150 --> 03:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
with multiple people and that was one of
 
03:38:12.830 --> 03:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
his comments that the probate's going to
 
03:38:16.550 --> 03:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
cost you the $3,000 anyway uh one of the
 
03:38:20.269 --> 03:38:20.279 align:start position:0%
fallbacks that initially I was I was
 
03:38:22.469 --> 03:38:22.479 align:start position:0%
concerned about and when we did this as
 
03:38:24.150 --> 03:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
a study committee years ago we had
 
03:38:29.550 --> 03:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:33.030 --> 03:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
somebody gets it wrong they they look at
 
03:38:35.150 --> 03:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
that list they pick the wrong person
 
03:38:36.750 --> 03:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
they give it to
 
03:38:39.469 --> 03:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
a um an ex-girlfriend when it should
 
03:38:43.630 --> 03:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
have gone to the dog da and to me the
 
03:38:47.070 --> 03:38:47.080 align:start position:0%
fall back on that is that the employer
 
03:38:50.830 --> 03:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
is not obligated to pay out 3,000 you
 
03:38:54.550 --> 03:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
can't just show up at an employer and
 
03:38:57.870 --> 03:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
say I'm the Man son give me my check
 
03:39:01.269 --> 03:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
it's still the employer
 
03:39:04.469 --> 03:39:04.479 align:start position:0%
May engage in the the process allowed
 
03:39:09.469 --> 03:39:09.479 align:start position:0%
here or may say have uh an attorney
 
03:39:11.990 --> 03:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
contact my attorney so I don't and we'll
 
03:39:14.309 --> 03:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
deal with it through probate to me
 
03:39:18.070 --> 03:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:20.750 --> 03:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
back so the employer could just say I'm
 
03:39:22.790 --> 03:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
not paying out anything it's going to
 
03:39:25.030 --> 03:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
probate right I don't get you folks
 
03:39:27.110 --> 03:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
03:39:29.790 --> 03:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
that I I would agree with that there is
 
03:39:32.030 --> 03:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
a May in there it's not a Shia okay so
 
03:39:33.750 --> 03:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
if the employer can't figure it out he
 
03:39:35.550 --> 03:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
can just say I'm hands
 
03:39:37.990 --> 03:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
off all
 
03:39:41.389 --> 03:39:41.399 align:start position:0%
right we know
 
03:39:43.229 --> 03:39:43.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um what
 
03:39:45.150 --> 03:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
protections do the employer have given
 
03:39:47.229 --> 03:39:47.239 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're in 275 which is
 
03:39:53.670 --> 03:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
employee protections for a wage claim
 
03:39:57.429 --> 03:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
from a beneficiary you didn't pay on
 
03:40:00.309 --> 03:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
time um you owe this we don't have we
 
03:40:02.189 --> 03:40:02.199 align:start position:0%
want access to all his employee files we
 
03:40:04.630 --> 03:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
want this we want that and
 
03:40:07.950 --> 03:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
then this says may the employee says no
 
03:40:10.389 --> 03:40:10.399 align:start position:0%
they go to you now the employer has to
 
03:40:12.790 --> 03:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
the cost of his attorney this that and
 
03:40:14.990 --> 03:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing
 
03:40:17.670 --> 03:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
to yeah I think the interaction could
 
03:40:19.550 --> 03:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
potentially come up in two different
 
03:40:21.550 --> 03:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
ways you know one you would have the
 
03:40:23.830 --> 03:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
scenario perhaps where
 
03:40:29.790 --> 03:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
the person the the the um dependent
 
03:40:32.070 --> 03:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
who's seeking the monies is perhaps
 
03:40:34.550 --> 03:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
trying to file a wage claim asserting
 
03:40:37.429 --> 03:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
some kind of right under
 
03:40:40.269 --> 03:40:40.279 align:start position:0%
27547 um I think that that is something
 
03:40:42.510 --> 03:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
the department could schedule in here
 
03:40:44.150 --> 03:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
and the analysis is going to have to
 
03:40:45.870 --> 03:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
flow from the facts that are presented
 
03:40:47.510 --> 03:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
over the course of that case was there a
 
03:40:49.110 --> 03:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
proper demand and then analyzing the
 
03:40:51.670 --> 03:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
language as it relates to May and if
 
03:40:53.510 --> 03:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's a May and it's not a sh and there's
 
03:40:54.910 --> 03:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
sufficient justification there that the
 
03:40:56.349 --> 03:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
employer doesn't have the obligation
 
03:40:57.790 --> 03:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
then the order could be that they're not
 
03:40:59.550 --> 03:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
obligated to pay it the other
 
03:41:00.750 --> 03:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
interaction would be through the
 
03:41:02.349 --> 03:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
Inspection Division if it somehow came
 
03:41:04.189 --> 03:41:04.199 align:start position:0%
up in the course or context of it a
 
03:41:07.550 --> 03:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
complaint you know if a um a dependent
 
03:41:09.550 --> 03:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
called and is complaining I we you know
 
03:41:11.110 --> 03:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
I I didn't get paid or it didn't get
 
03:41:12.110 --> 03:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
paid in
 
03:41:15.870 --> 03:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
full if the amount didn't get paid up to
 
03:41:19.750 --> 03:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
the ceiling or didn't get um I would say
 
03:41:21.269 --> 03:41:21.279 align:start position:0%
if the amount didn't get paid up to the
 
03:41:23.429 --> 03:41:23.439 align:start position:0%
ceiling you could be looking at I don't
 
03:41:25.950 --> 03:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
think it's like a violation of 27547
 
03:41:27.990 --> 03:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
itself it's a violation of the failure
 
03:41:30.309 --> 03:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
to make payment of wages but again you'd
 
03:41:32.309 --> 03:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
have to look at that language relative
 
03:41:35.389 --> 03:41:35.399 align:start position:0%
to May and in interacting with the
 
03:41:36.790 --> 03:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
employer interacting with the
 
03:41:38.590 --> 03:41:38.600 align:start position:0%
complainant and taking in whatever
 
03:41:40.670 --> 03:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
information they have the determination
 
03:41:42.070 --> 03:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
would be made as to whether or not they
 
03:41:43.830 --> 03:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
were due or not and again I do think you
 
03:41:45.670 --> 03:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
have to look at that language of May but
 
03:41:47.510 --> 03:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
I think it depends on the scen on the
 
03:41:50.309 --> 03:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
scenario on some level you know what was
 
03:41:51.870 --> 03:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
said if the employer said yep you made
 
03:41:53.110 --> 03:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
proper demand we're going to go ahead
 
03:41:56.429 --> 03:41:56.439 align:start position:0%
and do that um and only pays half of it
 
03:41:59.229 --> 03:41:59.239 align:start position:0%
or doesn't doesn't make the payment in a
 
03:42:01.070 --> 03:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
timely manner that could have
 
03:42:03.950 --> 03:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
interactions with other sections of the
 
03:42:06.830 --> 03:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
statute so if the employee is salaried
 
03:42:08.750 --> 03:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
employee let's just say and they don't
 
03:42:10.189 --> 03:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
show up to work for two or three days
 
03:42:13.149 --> 03:42:13.159 align:start position:0%
and you know it's their bi-weekly drop
 
03:42:15.710 --> 03:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
in their direct deposit account and
 
03:42:17.229 --> 03:42:17.239 align:start position:0%
somebody shows up the day after it's
 
03:42:19.790 --> 03:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
deposited into says we want to get his
 
03:42:21.389 --> 03:42:21.399 align:start position:0%
full pay well he hasn't been there for
 
03:42:23.750 --> 03:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
two weeks we just paid him his last
 
03:42:26.269 --> 03:42:26.279 align:start position:0%
paycheck you're on your own is there a
 
03:42:29.309 --> 03:42:29.319 align:start position:0%
wage claim against that under
 
03:42:32.510 --> 03:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
this scenario yeah I think that it would
 
03:42:33.830 --> 03:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
again it would
 
03:42:35.830 --> 03:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
depend one of the things that the
 
03:42:37.590 --> 03:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
department encourages employers and
 
03:42:39.229 --> 03:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
again it's primarily employers who call
 
03:42:41.550 --> 03:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
with questions about this particular
 
03:42:43.830 --> 03:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
provision is verifying like that you're
 
03:42:45.790 --> 03:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
paying the correct person the scenario
 
03:42:47.269 --> 03:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
you're talking about if I understand
 
03:42:49.870 --> 03:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
correctly is more so the direct deposit
 
03:42:51.469 --> 03:42:51.479 align:start position:0%
has gone maybe the employer is not aware
 
03:42:54.429 --> 03:42:54.439 align:start position:0%
that the person is deceased um you know
 
03:42:56.110 --> 03:42:56.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know what's in that bank account
 
03:42:57.590 --> 03:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
that may ultimately end up getting
 
03:42:59.269 --> 03:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
wrapped up as part of the appropriate
 
03:43:00.870 --> 03:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
process because it's sitting with some
 
03:43:04.189 --> 03:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
other asset that's um you know one if it
 
03:43:07.870 --> 03:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
was paid pre request by the dependent of
 
03:43:09.349 --> 03:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
the person is it now going to be wrapped
 
03:43:10.990 --> 03:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
up in assets that are going to get swept
 
03:43:13.630 --> 03:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
in with the probate um I think that
 
03:43:15.670 --> 03:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
again somebody could try to articulate a
 
03:43:16.950 --> 03:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
claim but whether or not it's going to
 
03:43:18.510 --> 03:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
be successful is going to depend on the
 
03:43:21.149 --> 03:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
timing of of when payment was made what
 
03:43:22.630 --> 03:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
kind when the demand was made or when
 
03:43:24.990 --> 03:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
the request was made what the employer's
 
03:43:27.349 --> 03:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
response was I mean I think employers do
 
03:43:29.550 --> 03:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
have to be cautious uh when making
 
03:43:31.750 --> 03:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
payments because if you pay the wrong
 
03:43:33.910 --> 03:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
person you know oh you're telling me
 
03:43:36.149 --> 03:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
you're the person's spouse and I think
 
03:43:38.070 --> 03:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
you know per my research or asking my
 
03:43:39.550 --> 03:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
attorney or however they went about
 
03:43:41.710 --> 03:43:41.720 align:start position:0%
checking the in intestacy I'll say it
 
03:43:44.510 --> 03:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
wrong statute to determine who's who's
 
03:43:46.110 --> 03:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
the right person to pay but I didn't
 
03:43:47.870 --> 03:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
verify who that person was and now I
 
03:43:50.389 --> 03:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
paid a cousin um has the payment been
 
03:43:52.510 --> 03:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
made it has not you know so if the
 
03:43:55.630 --> 03:43:55.640 align:start position:0%
cousin comes or the the dependent who is
 
03:43:57.550 --> 03:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
entitled comes forward and says hey I
 
03:43:59.510 --> 03:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
want the payment and the employer is
 
03:44:02.750 --> 03:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
like oh I've already paid it out you
 
03:44:04.429 --> 03:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
haven't paid the right person you know
 
03:44:06.189 --> 03:44:06.199 align:start position:0%
so has the payment actually been made
 
03:44:07.590 --> 03:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
and I think there are other steps the
 
03:44:08.950 --> 03:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
employer has to go through to try to
 
03:44:10.389 --> 03:44:10.399 align:start position:0%
recoup that money from the person who
 
03:44:12.189 --> 03:44:12.199 align:start position:0%
actually wasn't entitled to it they want
 
03:44:13.269 --> 03:44:13.279 align:start position:0%
to get it
 
03:44:13.279 --> 03:44:18.469 align:start position:0%
to get it
back

03:44:18.469 --> 03:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:21.830 --> 03:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
um want to go
 
03:44:24.389 --> 03:44:24.399 align:start position:0%
on now
 
03:44:30.110 --> 03:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:32.710 --> 03:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
that in the context of some of these
 
03:44:35.830 --> 03:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
questions about what can go wrong that
 
03:44:39.110 --> 03:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
the existence of such a law is probably
 
03:44:41.910 --> 03:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
more protective to the employer than
 
03:44:44.870 --> 03:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
obligatory on the employer and why I say
 
03:44:48.229 --> 03:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
that is so if this law didn't exist the
 
03:44:51.189 --> 03:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
labor department would take no position
 
03:44:53.469 --> 03:44:53.479 align:start position:0%
on what happened when somebody showed up
 
03:44:56.189 --> 03:44:56.199 align:start position:0%
and asked for a check of any amount from
 
03:44:59.189 --> 03:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
an employer to me the existence of this
 
03:45:02.269 --> 03:45:02.279 align:start position:0%
law gives the employer sort of a
 
03:45:06.229 --> 03:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
presumption of I considered this request
 
03:45:08.469 --> 03:45:08.479 align:start position:0%
I looked at the law I followed the law
 
03:45:10.269 --> 03:45:10.279 align:start position:0%
to the letter
 
03:45:15.149 --> 03:45:15.159 align:start position:0%
and that's all I can do um do you and
 
03:45:17.510 --> 03:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's it kind of flips maybe the intent
 
03:45:19.110 --> 03:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about which is to get
 
03:45:21.469 --> 03:45:21.479 align:start position:0%
the money to the person but it seems to
 
03:45:24.670 --> 03:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
me this also has an effect of saying
 
03:45:26.950 --> 03:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
here are the parameters employer that
 
03:45:29.429 --> 03:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
you work in and if you do
 
03:45:32.389 --> 03:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
that hopefully that's going to be okay
 
03:45:35.349 --> 03:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
for you does that make sense I I think
 
03:45:37.710 --> 03:45:37.720 align:start position:0%
that does make sense um I think that's a
 
03:45:39.790 --> 03:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
fair way of of coloring it if the
 
03:45:42.910 --> 03:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
section did not exist at all and there's
 
03:45:44.750 --> 03:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
money that's then outstanding and I'll
 
03:45:47.149 --> 03:45:47.159 align:start position:0%
perhaps let attorney mcra correct me if
 
03:45:49.790 --> 03:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
I'm in if I'm wrong on the application
 
03:45:53.510 --> 03:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
but if if the final paycheck is owed
 
03:45:56.429 --> 03:45:56.439 align:start position:0%
time was worked the money is owed this
 
03:45:57.910 --> 03:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
provision doesn't exist setting the
 
03:46:00.070 --> 03:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
ceiling for which some form of the wage
 
03:46:02.710 --> 03:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
can be paid to a designated
 
03:46:05.030 --> 03:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
individual I think it would then become
 
03:46:06.950 --> 03:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
part of what gets swept up within the
 
03:46:10.030 --> 03:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
whole probate process um I don't know
 
03:46:11.870 --> 03:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
how the department would go through
 
03:46:13.590 --> 03:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily and say oh you're you're
 
03:46:16.550 --> 03:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
required under other sections of 275 to
 
03:46:19.189 --> 03:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
pay a dependent in the absence of
 
03:46:20.710 --> 03:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
something from a court saying this is
 
03:46:23.830 --> 03:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
the executrix or executor or the person
 
03:46:26.710 --> 03:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
who's allowed to take care of Affairs of
 
03:46:30.910 --> 03:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:33.950 --> 03:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
deceased keep keep
 
03:46:37.309 --> 03:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
on so in relations to
 
03:46:39.910 --> 03:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
a I don't want to say violation but if
 
03:46:43.229 --> 03:46:43.239 align:start position:0%
there was an an inspection and this was
 
03:46:44.790 --> 03:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
found okay you didn't pay this employee
 
03:46:46.469 --> 03:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
within the designated time even though
 
03:46:48.469 --> 03:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
he was deceased would that be a
 
03:46:50.269 --> 03:46:50.279 align:start position:0%
violation to the employer for not paying
 
03:46:54.670 --> 03:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:57.750 --> 03:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
27547 it potentially could be again I
 
03:47:00.510 --> 03:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
think it would depend on on the scenario
 
03:47:02.910 --> 03:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
it's possible in certain scenarios it
 
03:47:02.920 --> 03:47:08.510 align:start position:0%
it's possible in certain scenarios it
could

03:47:08.510 --> 03:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:11.229 --> 03:47:11.239 align:start position:0%
be all right we're still in two we're
 
03:47:13.750 --> 03:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
still in 275 How could an employer make
 
03:47:15.830 --> 03:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
a payment to somebody that's not their
 
03:47:15.840 --> 03:47:17.750 align:start position:0%
a payment to somebody that's not their
employee

03:47:17.750 --> 03:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
employee
 
03:47:20.269 --> 03:47:20.279 align:start position:0%
um but you mean if this provision didn't
 
03:47:22.349 --> 03:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
exist well it says May so I I want to
 
03:47:24.389 --> 03:47:24.399 align:start position:0%
know what protections there is you know
 
03:47:25.830 --> 03:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
we've talked about you know wife
 
03:47:29.550 --> 03:47:29.560 align:start position:0%
daughter cousin whatever right what
 
03:47:32.189 --> 03:47:32.199 align:start position:0%
authorizes them under 275 to pay
 
03:47:34.630 --> 03:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
somebody other than an employee I think
 
03:47:36.110 --> 03:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
you would have to look at the two
 
03:47:37.950 --> 03:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
Provisions in conjunction with one
 
03:47:40.349 --> 03:47:40.359 align:start position:0%
another so if the
 
03:47:42.189 --> 03:47:42.199 align:start position:0%
um and again one the Department's never
 
03:47:44.550 --> 03:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
cited or had had the issue come up so
 
03:47:46.550 --> 03:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to H hypothetically think
 
03:47:48.149 --> 03:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
about the type of scenario where it
 
03:47:50.870 --> 03:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
could potentially come up if there were
 
03:47:52.950 --> 03:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
a request from the dependent to make the
 
03:47:54.950 --> 03:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
payment and and I think it would come up
 
03:47:57.429 --> 03:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
more in the context of the employer made
 
03:47:59.990 --> 03:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
maybe a partial but didn't fulfill the
 
03:48:04.189 --> 03:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
full ceilinged amount uh so 300 or 3,000
 
03:48:06.389 --> 03:48:06.399 align:start position:0%
whatever the dollar amount was and
 
03:48:08.990 --> 03:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
didn't make the the full payment um but
 
03:48:11.189 --> 03:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
was oper ating under
 
03:48:14.149 --> 03:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
27547 it could potentially rise to the
 
03:48:16.269 --> 03:48:16.279 align:start position:0%
level of a violation of not making the
 
03:48:18.269 --> 03:48:18.279 align:start position:0%
timely payment when you're reading the
 
03:48:19.870 --> 03:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
two in conjunction with one another or
 
03:48:21.710 --> 03:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
making the payment in when you look at
 
03:48:23.590 --> 03:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
the two in conjunction with one another
 
03:48:25.469 --> 03:48:25.479 align:start position:0%
think if the interaction was that the
 
03:48:26.910 --> 03:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
you know the Department's engaging with
 
03:48:28.269 --> 03:48:28.279 align:start position:0%
the employer and the employer is
 
03:48:31.149 --> 03:48:31.159 align:start position:0%
pointing to that but it's a May or you
 
03:48:32.630 --> 03:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
know it's it's we've got notice of a
 
03:48:34.550 --> 03:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
probate I don't know that that I don't
 
03:48:35.870 --> 03:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
believe that would rise to the level of
 
03:48:37.309 --> 03:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
evaluation but those are factors that
 
03:48:39.510 --> 03:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
the department would have to consider in
 
03:48:43.469 --> 03:48:43.479 align:start position:0%
acting with the employer about what had
 
03:48:46.510 --> 03:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
happened correct but I don't
 
03:48:49.950 --> 03:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
under 275 there is no provision to make
 
03:48:51.630 --> 03:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
that payment to someone else other than
 
03:48:51.640 --> 03:48:54.030 align:start position:0%
that payment to someone else other than
the

03:48:54.030 --> 03:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:56.630 --> 03:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
employee that's right as an employer
 
03:48:58.870 --> 03:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
reading that I can't just go and pay the
 
03:49:01.750 --> 03:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
daughter his residual checks with the
 
03:49:04.550 --> 03:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
exception of the section 47 which does
 
03:49:07.870 --> 03:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
allow for it if the again looking at
 
03:49:09.630 --> 03:49:09.640 align:start position:0%
that language of May but I think section
 
03:49:12.229 --> 03:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
47 does authorize in these Limited in
 
03:49:14.349 --> 03:49:14.359 align:start position:0%
these types of circumstances for the
 
03:49:16.309 --> 03:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
employer to make payment again it's not
 
03:49:17.830 --> 03:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily the full pay check if the
 
03:49:19.950 --> 03:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
paycheck is in excess of what the
 
03:49:22.149 --> 03:49:22.159 align:start position:0%
statutory amount is but it's creating
 
03:49:23.950 --> 03:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
the mechanism by which somebody other
 
03:49:26.149 --> 03:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
than the employee can get paid in these
 
03:49:28.510 --> 03:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances okay so the so the
 
03:49:30.469 --> 03:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
employer goes ahead and deposits their
 
03:49:33.070 --> 03:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
entire weekly check un unbeknownst to
 
03:49:36.030 --> 03:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
the employer
 
03:49:39.070 --> 03:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
um and a wage claim is made saying you
 
03:49:41.189 --> 03:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
because because you didn't follow this
 
03:49:43.469 --> 03:49:43.479 align:start position:0%
particular and give us the $3,000
 
03:49:47.550 --> 03:49:47.560 align:start position:0%
outside of the his direct deposit into
 
03:49:49.389 --> 03:49:49.399 align:start position:0%
his account which we have no access
 
03:49:52.510 --> 03:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
to would the employer be on the hook for
 
03:49:55.189 --> 03:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
that so let me just to make sure I
 
03:49:56.550 --> 03:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
understand the scenario quickly so I'm
 
03:49:58.389 --> 03:49:58.399 align:start position:0%
sorry forgive me for if I'm being
 
03:50:00.870 --> 03:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
repetitive employee got paid or the
 
03:50:03.550 --> 03:50:03.560 align:start position:0%
dependent got paid the employee so I
 
03:50:04.670 --> 03:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
have an employ let's say I have an
 
03:50:06.750 --> 03:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
employee he gets paid weekly you know he
 
03:50:08.510 --> 03:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
dies on a Thursday his check goes in on
 
03:50:10.790 --> 03:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
Friday yep the following week There's No
 
03:50:12.870 --> 03:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't show up y so he's not entitled
 
03:50:15.149 --> 03:50:15.159 align:start position:0%
to a paycheck right they show up and say
 
03:50:16.550 --> 03:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
we want his last paycheck while he was
 
03:50:19.910 --> 03:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
deposited on bah blah baah prior to
 
03:50:21.229 --> 03:50:21.239 align:start position:0%
notification of the employer that the
 
03:50:23.510 --> 03:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
employee is now deceased I think in the
 
03:50:25.750 --> 03:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
that instance based on that scenario if
 
03:50:27.189 --> 03:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding the hypothetical
 
03:50:29.349 --> 03:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
correctly the payment has been made it's
 
03:50:30.950 --> 03:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
now sitting in the account that was the
 
03:50:33.550 --> 03:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
employees account it was made on in the
 
03:50:35.309 --> 03:50:35.319 align:start position:0%
time man time means and manner is
 
03:50:38.030 --> 03:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
specified by Statute after that payments
 
03:50:39.590 --> 03:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
occurred somebody dependent is coming
 
03:50:41.349 --> 03:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
forward saying oh I'm trying to exercise
 
03:50:44.070 --> 03:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
Options under Section 47 of the
 
03:50:46.030 --> 03:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
statute I think there's a good argument
 
03:50:47.710 --> 03:50:47.720 align:start position:0%
there payment has been made whatever's
 
03:50:49.070 --> 03:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
sitting in that account whether it's the
 
03:50:50.950 --> 03:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
sole paycheck or it's a million dollars
 
03:50:53.149 --> 03:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
plus the paycheck um is more likely than
 
03:50:54.870 --> 03:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
not going to get swept in with the sort
 
03:50:59.510 --> 03:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
of wrap up of the of the person's estate
 
03:51:01.750 --> 03:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
um and if it goes through probate goes
 
03:51:04.030 --> 03:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
through probate it may very well be
 
03:51:06.349 --> 03:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
swept up within the probate process okay
 
03:51:07.469 --> 03:51:07.479 align:start position:0%
just make sure that there's protections
 
03:51:10.229 --> 03:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
for the employer if they're following to
 
03:51:11.870 --> 03:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
and then this is coming up at a later
 
03:51:13.950 --> 03:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
dat so they don't have to incur attorney
 
03:51:15.950 --> 03:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
cost and and possibly hearing and
 
03:51:17.710 --> 03:51:17.720 align:start position:0%
everything else to make sure that hey
 
03:51:19.229 --> 03:51:19.239 align:start position:0%
you know what we did what we're supposed
 
03:51:21.550 --> 03:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
to do as an employee we don't want to
 
03:51:23.750 --> 03:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
get into all this and I'm gonna I think
 
03:51:25.349 --> 03:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
attorney mcra wanted to add something to
 
03:51:27.710 --> 03:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
that so if it's okay so in the current
 
03:51:29.189 --> 03:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
language of Statute which doesn't look
 
03:51:30.990 --> 03:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
like it's being altered at all it also
 
03:51:34.830 --> 03:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
says making proper demand so looking at
 
03:51:37.149 --> 03:51:37.159 align:start position:0%
the request let's say that the cousin
 
03:51:39.349 --> 03:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
comes the week after the death the
 
03:51:41.830 --> 03:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
employer just then is notified of the
 
03:51:44.990 --> 03:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
death is that proper demand and I don't
 
03:51:46.550 --> 03:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that question but
 
03:51:48.790 --> 03:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
that can be something that can be um
 
03:51:51.070 --> 03:51:51.080 align:start position:0%
dealt with at a hearing or it could be
 
03:51:53.950 --> 03:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
dealt with at probate um if the employer
 
03:51:56.990 --> 03:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
has notice of the death prior to the
 
03:52:00.510 --> 03:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
issuance of that final paycheck I think
 
03:52:02.630 --> 03:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
that's where we are looking at the May
 
03:52:04.790 --> 03:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
or the shall and the due diligence
 
03:52:06.990 --> 03:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
requirement for the employer comes into
 
03:52:10.550 --> 03:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
play but I think proper demand can be
 
03:52:13.229 --> 03:52:13.239 align:start position:0%
defined in any way that makes sure that
 
03:52:15.429 --> 03:52:15.439 align:start position:0%
it complies with the statute and if
 
03:52:17.790 --> 03:52:17.800 align:start position:0%
there's no money to be had because in
 
03:52:19.710 --> 03:52:19.720 align:start position:0%
your scenario representative avalani
 
03:52:22.189 --> 03:52:22.199 align:start position:0%
there would be no money the person's
 
03:52:23.990 --> 03:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
paid and there's they didn't come to
 
03:52:25.710 --> 03:52:25.720 align:start position:0%
work the next week so therefore there is
 
03:52:28.429 --> 03:52:28.439 align:start position:0%
no money owed therefore based upon the
 
03:52:30.269 --> 03:52:30.279 align:start position:0%
statute there's no money to
 
03:52:33.670 --> 03:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
pay I have a follow up to that oh now
 
03:52:36.429 --> 03:52:36.439 align:start position:0%
say there was wages due beyond that say
 
03:52:38.070 --> 03:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
it was there was you know vacation time
 
03:52:39.469 --> 03:52:39.479 align:start position:0%
or sick time or something there was you
 
03:52:42.349 --> 03:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
know acred and needed to be paid out
 
03:52:44.750 --> 03:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
what if that is also automatically done
 
03:52:46.429 --> 03:52:46.439 align:start position:0%
given that you know say the employer has
 
03:52:48.630 --> 03:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
a three-day termination policy no show
 
03:52:50.229 --> 03:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
policy you terminated you they paid all
 
03:52:53.149 --> 03:52:53.159 align:start position:0%
their benefits to this account they're
 
03:52:55.389 --> 03:52:55.399 align:start position:0%
done and you know the employer was
 
03:52:57.710 --> 03:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
notified the week after again same thing
 
03:52:59.469 --> 03:52:59.479 align:start position:0%
you know after the window that the money
 
03:53:01.830 --> 03:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
has been deposited would they get in
 
03:53:03.710 --> 03:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
trouble for not following this because
 
03:53:07.950 --> 03:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:07.960 --> 03:53:10.229 align:start position:0%
 
descendants

03:53:10.229 --> 03:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
descendants
 
03:53:11.990 --> 03:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
I think that well first of all I think
 
03:53:14.030 --> 03:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
you're also bringing um representative
 
03:53:15.990 --> 03:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
kahill's bill into this as well that was
 
03:53:18.790 --> 03:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier today so could I just
 
03:53:20.030 --> 03:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
had to make a little bit of a a
 
03:53:22.790 --> 03:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
statement on that um but I think it
 
03:53:24.590 --> 03:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
really comes down to the same thing that
 
03:53:26.469 --> 03:53:26.479 align:start position:0%
Deputy commissioner's been talking about
 
03:53:30.030 --> 03:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
which is there's the the recourse is a
 
03:53:32.469 --> 03:53:32.479 align:start position:0%
potential hearing there is the notice
 
03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
Provisions there's the proper demand
 
03:53:36.510 --> 03:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
Provisions that are in all of this
 
03:53:37.990 --> 03:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not the employer actually has
 
03:53:40.349 --> 03:53:40.359 align:start position:0%
a practice or policy policy sorry I'm
 
03:53:42.389 --> 03:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
bringing that back in a practice or
 
03:53:44.630 --> 03:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
policy to pay that out automatically
 
03:53:47.910 --> 03:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
even on a three-day no call no show um
 
03:53:50.110 --> 03:53:50.120 align:start position:0%
you have to look at all the evidence and
 
03:53:52.389 --> 03:53:52.399 align:start position:0%
and take it from there um has the
 
03:53:54.670 --> 03:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
employer done is due diligence really
 
03:53:58.590 --> 03:53:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:02.110 --> 03:54:02.120 align:start position:0%
Forefront and this will be it okay like
 
03:54:04.870 --> 03:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
I said so if the employee doesn't show
 
03:54:07.510 --> 03:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
up they cause for demand after
 
03:54:08.950 --> 03:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
everything has already been paid out
 
03:54:12.750 --> 03:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
into his account per 275 that we would
 
03:54:15.030 --> 03:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
follow up until that point is the
 
03:54:17.429 --> 03:54:17.439 align:start position:0%
employer protected for making those
 
03:54:20.349 --> 03:54:20.359 align:start position:0%
deposits from going through a hearing
 
03:54:23.189 --> 03:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
and everything else through a wage claim
 
03:54:27.030 --> 03:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
because we didn't follow this
 
03:54:29.389 --> 03:54:29.399 align:start position:0%
piece let me see if I understand that
 
03:54:31.590 --> 03:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
because it it's I'm not sure that I'm
 
03:54:35.790 --> 03:54:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:38.189 --> 03:54:38.199 align:start position:0%
again so an employeer has a policy 3
 
03:54:40.429 --> 03:54:40.439 align:start position:0%
days no call no show you're you're
 
03:54:42.750 --> 03:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
terminated all your benefits whatever is
 
03:54:45.830 --> 03:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
paid out boom boom boom they show up
 
03:54:47.910 --> 03:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
afterwards the employee or the family
 
03:54:50.630 --> 03:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
the family shows up after bearing demand
 
03:54:52.670 --> 03:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
upon whatever is left over okay with
 
03:54:55.070 --> 03:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
with and then they go after the employer
 
03:54:56.510 --> 03:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
stonewalls and says we paid them we
 
03:54:57.550 --> 03:54:57.560 align:start position:0%
haven't heard from anything we don't
 
03:54:59.110 --> 03:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
want to get involved they go to the
 
03:55:00.550 --> 03:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
department and say okay well
 
03:55:02.269 --> 03:55:02.279 align:start position:0%
everything's in his account now we can't
 
03:55:03.870 --> 03:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
we can't get it because they they should
 
03:55:06.550 --> 03:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
have sent it to us according to what
 
03:55:09.149 --> 03:55:09.159 align:start position:0%
we're doing here today but want make
 
03:55:10.269 --> 03:55:10.279 align:start position:0%
sure there's a there's protections for
 
03:55:11.710 --> 03:55:11.720 align:start position:0%
the employeer not to incur additional
 
03:55:13.550 --> 03:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
cost attorneys fees time and everything
 
03:55:15.030 --> 03:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
else the department is just going to say
 
03:55:16.469 --> 03:55:16.479 align:start position:0%
you did what you're supposed to do under
 
03:55:18.790 --> 03:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
275 by paying your employee following
 
03:55:20.830 --> 03:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
your policies but we're going to have a
 
03:55:22.389 --> 03:55:22.399 align:start position:0%
hearing because they brought in a wage
 
03:55:25.110 --> 03:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
claim and we we don't know this is very
 
03:55:26.510 --> 03:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
because it's a May instead of a shall or
 
03:55:27.510 --> 03:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
this or that we want to make sure that
 
03:55:29.309 --> 03:55:29.319 align:start position:0%
we're clear going forward that there's
 
03:55:31.149 --> 03:55:31.159 align:start position:0%
no additional cost to that employer for
 
03:55:33.510 --> 03:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
following the rules of proper payments
 
03:55:36.070 --> 03:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
relating in 275 as we do on a daily
 
03:55:38.469 --> 03:55:38.479 align:start position:0%
basis okay I believe I understand the
 
03:55:40.990 --> 03:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
question correct me if I'm wrong Mike
 
03:55:42.590 --> 03:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
one question back to you before I say
 
03:55:45.070 --> 03:55:45.080 align:start position:0%
anything though is did the employer have
 
03:55:48.149 --> 03:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
notice that the employee was deceased
 
03:55:51.149 --> 03:55:51.159 align:start position:0%
prior to issuing all those payments of
 
03:55:53.229 --> 03:55:53.239 align:start position:0%
the PTO or whatever it is that they were
 
03:55:55.229 --> 03:55:55.239 align:start position:0%
entitled to by the three call no
 
03:55:57.710 --> 03:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
three-day no call noow was the employer
 
03:55:59.309 --> 03:55:59.319 align:start position:0%
notified that the employee was deceased
 
03:56:01.070 --> 03:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
prior to the issuance of that pay let's
 
03:56:03.269 --> 03:56:03.279 align:start position:0%
just say no for this time then the
 
03:56:05.630 --> 03:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
employer should be protected based upon
 
03:56:08.110 --> 03:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
the language of this with no notice that
 
03:56:10.389 --> 03:56:10.399 align:start position:0%
the employee has been deceased which
 
03:56:11.990 --> 03:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
could then potentially put it into
 
03:56:14.469 --> 03:56:14.479 align:start position:0%
probate the employer should also be
 
03:56:16.030 --> 03:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
protected by the fact that they were
 
03:56:17.670 --> 03:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
just issuing payment the way their
 
03:56:20.510 --> 03:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
practice and policy was pursuant to
 
03:56:22.510 --> 03:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's an employee manual or just
 
03:56:25.309 --> 03:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
simply practice and policy the employee
 
03:56:27.149 --> 03:56:27.159 align:start position:0%
didn't show up for work the employer had
 
03:56:29.110 --> 03:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
no idea as to why the employee didn't
 
03:56:33.070 --> 03:56:33.080 align:start position:0%
show up it may have to be addressed um
 
03:56:34.790 --> 03:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Labor through a
 
03:56:38.110 --> 03:56:38.120 align:start position:0%
hearing but there are Protections in
 
03:56:40.870 --> 03:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
there I didn't didn't know he was dead I
 
03:56:45.110 --> 03:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
didn't know and then proper demand was
 
03:56:47.269 --> 03:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
not made until after all payments were
 
03:56:49.469 --> 03:56:49.479 align:start position:0%
issued and after the employer was
 
03:56:53.309 --> 03:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
notified of the deed okay if
 
03:56:57.590 --> 03:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
I may uh clarify a little bit part of
 
03:57:00.710 --> 03:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing is and I think it's not
 
03:57:03.750 --> 03:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
just this it's the way any wage claim
 
03:57:06.469 --> 03:57:06.479 align:start position:0%
would work there's never a black and
 
03:57:09.590 --> 03:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
white right it anything
 
03:57:12.349 --> 03:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
one side could say I want I disagree
 
03:57:14.349 --> 03:57:14.359 align:start position:0%
with what you just told me I want a
 
03:57:16.670 --> 03:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
hearing and and that's kind of what
 
03:57:18.870 --> 03:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
you're saying here you can't guarantee
 
03:57:21.229 --> 03:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
that given these circumstances this is
 
03:57:23.950 --> 03:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
how it would end up because that hearing
 
03:57:28.110 --> 03:57:28.120 align:start position:0%
process is part and parcel of how any
 
03:57:31.429 --> 03:57:31.439 align:start position:0%
issue is resolved right am I I think yes
 
03:57:32.870 --> 03:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
I think that's correct representative
 
03:57:35.110 --> 03:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
seaworth um you know when parties
 
03:57:37.189 --> 03:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
request a hearing they're putting
 
03:57:38.790 --> 03:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
forward that there's some kind of
 
03:57:40.870 --> 03:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
dispute but the resolution of that
 
03:57:43.110 --> 03:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
dispute or whether or not there's even
 
03:57:45.189 --> 03:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
Merit to the dispute is something that's
 
03:57:47.510 --> 03:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
addressed over the course of that uh
 
03:57:49.229 --> 03:57:49.239 align:start position:0%
hearing process whether it's done
 
03:57:52.389 --> 03:57:52.399 align:start position:0%
through um prelimin preliminary written
 
03:57:54.590 --> 03:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
correspondence and we see a lot of that
 
03:57:56.910 --> 03:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
in wage claims you know an employee
 
03:57:58.990 --> 03:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
asserts a claim an employer will respond
 
03:58:01.630 --> 03:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
and say well that's not the case because
 
03:58:03.469 --> 03:58:03.479 align:start position:0%
X Y and Z I don't think you should
 
03:58:05.429 --> 03:58:05.439 align:start position:0%
schedule this hearing and it can be
 
03:58:07.269 --> 03:58:07.279 align:start position:0%
assessed in weighed at that point and if
 
03:58:09.670 --> 03:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
the determination is okay the threshold
 
03:58:11.070 --> 03:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
has not been met to have a hearing it
 
03:58:14.349 --> 03:58:14.359 align:start position:0%
maybe not go forward on that basis more
 
03:58:16.990 --> 03:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
often than not they do go to the hearing
 
03:58:18.910 --> 03:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
the parties have the opportunity then to
 
03:58:20.590 --> 03:58:20.600 align:start position:0%
present all those pieces and exactly as
 
03:58:22.110 --> 03:58:22.120 align:start position:0%
attorney mcra had outlined it's
 
03:58:24.710 --> 03:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
something the employer could raise and
 
03:58:25.910 --> 03:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's where the determination would
 
03:58:28.149 --> 03:58:28.159 align:start position:0%
ultimately come from um so I don't know
 
03:58:29.590 --> 03:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
if the question is in part would it
 
03:58:31.950 --> 03:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
Stave off you know a hearing from being
 
03:58:33.110 --> 03:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
scheduled I don't know that the
 
03:58:34.389 --> 03:58:34.399 align:start position:0%
department could say that with any
 
03:58:36.990 --> 03:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
certainty again would kind of depend on
 
03:58:40.990 --> 03:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
what was filed what the responses were
 
03:58:43.510 --> 03:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
um but it could dictate it could dictate
 
03:58:44.710 --> 03:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
the course of the
 
03:58:48.110 --> 03:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
outcome thank you represent right I know
 
03:58:53.309 --> 03:58:53.319 align:start position:0%
Don's got his hand up as well um the um
 
03:58:57.830 --> 03:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
guess a couple points I think being
 
03:59:03.670 --> 03:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
U directed to the word may um that
 
03:59:07.070 --> 03:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
that's that basically um addresses most
 
03:59:08.990 --> 03:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
everything if you accidentally pay the
 
03:59:11.030 --> 03:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
employee and someone comes asking for
 
03:59:14.349 --> 03:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
the money May gets you out of it um
 
03:59:15.950 --> 03:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
because basically it says you may do it
 
03:59:19.429 --> 03:59:19.439 align:start position:0%
you may not um and so essentially I I
 
03:59:22.429 --> 03:59:22.439 align:start position:0%
because I was uh concerned about the
 
03:59:25.910 --> 03:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
issue raised during the hearing of um uh
 
03:59:30.030 --> 03:59:30.040 align:start position:0%
automatic um uh payroll
 
03:59:32.389 --> 03:59:32.399 align:start position:0%
um direct deposit direct deposit thank
 
03:59:36.309 --> 03:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
you um um because I I mean I bet that
 
03:59:37.830 --> 03:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
would happen almost all the time because
 
03:59:39.550 --> 03:59:39.560 align:start position:0%
most people are paid by direct deposit
 
03:59:42.990 --> 03:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
now and um unless somebody says stop
 
03:59:44.349 --> 03:59:44.359 align:start position:0%
that money is going to get dumped into
 
03:59:47.349 --> 03:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
the the account um and if the if someone
 
03:59:49.990 --> 03:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
shows up and and gives their notice
 
03:59:51.710 --> 03:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
they'll simply say sorry there's no
 
03:59:54.830 --> 03:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
money be and and I was not required to
 
03:59:58.790 --> 03:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
give this to uh to anybody um and it it
 
04:00:01.149 --> 04:00:01.159 align:start position:0%
it's in Probate it it'll come to you but
 
04:00:03.149 --> 04:00:03.159 align:start position:0%
just no time soon and I guess my other
 
04:00:05.790 --> 04:00:05.800 align:start position:0%
point is if I was in the position of
 
04:00:09.070 --> 04:00:09.080 align:start position:0%
advising somebody on this statute
 
04:00:13.550 --> 04:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
I'd say optt out to the employer because
 
04:00:17.389 --> 04:00:17.399 align:start position:0%
basically once you start writing checks
 
04:00:19.790 --> 04:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
now you've created a potential liability
 
04:00:21.710 --> 04:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
if you simply say I'm going
 
04:00:24.550 --> 04:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
to I'm not going to do this I mean I'm
 
04:00:25.990 --> 04:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure some employers are just going
 
04:00:28.510 --> 04:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
to wanting to be kind-hearted and take
 
04:00:30.269 --> 04:00:30.279 align:start position:0%
advantage of this opportunity to help a
 
04:00:33.710 --> 04:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
family of an employee and so on but
 
04:00:36.429 --> 04:00:36.439 align:start position:0%
um it seems like a better idea to Simply
 
04:00:38.030 --> 04:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
say I know I could but I'm going to
 
04:00:40.870 --> 04:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:43.510 --> 04:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
to and and I think looking at the
 
04:00:45.429 --> 04:00:45.439 align:start position:0%
current iteration of the language and I
 
04:00:47.269 --> 04:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
don't believe this section is changing
 
04:00:49.349 --> 04:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
um as well it's wages that are due so in
 
04:00:51.750 --> 04:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
the scenarios where deposit has been
 
04:00:54.030 --> 04:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
made and it's pre- notification of death
 
04:00:57.510 --> 04:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's preoper Demand by the deant or the
 
04:01:00.429 --> 04:01:00.439 align:start position:0%
The Descendants or deant or The deant
 
04:01:02.870 --> 04:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
Descendants um and I think attorney
 
04:01:04.950 --> 04:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
McGrath had highlighted this our wages
 
04:01:06.830 --> 04:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
due at that point if they've already
 
04:01:09.149 --> 04:01:09.159 align:start position:0%
been paid right um I think think this my
 
04:01:10.750 --> 04:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
reading of the statute and its current
 
04:01:12.790 --> 04:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
iteration at least is it's intended to
 
04:01:14.389 --> 04:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
address those scenarios where there's
 
04:01:16.189 --> 04:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
still some form of payment that's
 
04:01:21.070 --> 04:01:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:24.030 --> 04:01:24.040 align:start position:0%
paid um
 
04:01:27.070 --> 04:01:27.080 align:start position:0%
thanks representative suin just asked
 
04:01:29.429 --> 04:01:29.439 align:start position:0%
two of the questions I was going to
 
04:01:33.149 --> 04:01:33.159 align:start position:0%
ask bring up the third one is all this
 
04:01:36.149 --> 04:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
bill does is change the amount and
 
04:01:39.070 --> 04:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
clarifies another statement everything
 
04:01:42.429 --> 04:01:42.439 align:start position:0%
else is already in the
 
04:01:45.910 --> 04:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
law am I correct in analyzing that I
 
04:01:48.670 --> 04:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
believe that is correct yes thank you
 
04:01:51.750 --> 04:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
and I guess the Counterpoint to that is
 
04:01:53.990 --> 04:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
04:01:57.670 --> 04:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
$300 you ju you just don't have the
 
04:02:00.630 --> 04:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
experience that you might get if it if
 
04:02:03.269 --> 04:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
we raise it to a more reasonable amount
 
04:02:05.870 --> 04:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
so that's part of I think why some
 
04:02:08.590 --> 04:02:08.600 align:start position:0%
people have these hypotheticals is well
 
04:02:10.790 --> 04:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
what if employers actually start using
 
04:02:13.349 --> 04:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
it will will we see something that we
 
04:02:15.590 --> 04:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
haven't seen before sure and and to be
 
04:02:18.429 --> 04:02:18.439 align:start position:0%
clear I I don't know that the department
 
04:02:20.990 --> 04:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
has a good sense or can with any
 
04:02:23.110 --> 04:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
certainty say are employers using this
 
04:02:26.030 --> 04:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
or not using it things issues come to
 
04:02:28.229 --> 04:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
the Department's attention you know when
 
04:02:30.790 --> 04:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
somebody's got a technical question am I
 
04:02:32.510 --> 04:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
obligated to do this is there a law out
 
04:02:34.389 --> 04:02:34.399 align:start position:0%
there that addresses this somebody asked
 
04:02:35.990 --> 04:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
me about it I don't know how it works
 
04:02:37.429 --> 04:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
can you guide me through the process I
 
04:02:39.030 --> 04:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
think that's a lot of the Department's
 
04:02:41.510 --> 04:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
interactions um you know or through a
 
04:02:43.030 --> 04:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
complaint process I'm complaining
 
04:02:45.950 --> 04:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
because I I asked for wages I wasn't
 
04:02:48.189 --> 04:02:48.199 align:start position:0%
paid in time workers comp complaints
 
04:02:50.349 --> 04:02:50.359 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be when things are
 
04:02:52.670 --> 04:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
running well or if parties are not
 
04:02:54.750 --> 04:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
having disputes or don't have questions
 
04:02:56.550 --> 04:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
that that does not necessarily land with
 
04:02:58.349 --> 04:02:58.359 align:start position:0%
the department so I don't know to what
 
04:03:00.790 --> 04:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
degree employers are or are not engaging
 
04:03:02.790 --> 04:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
with the statutory provision I don't
 
04:03:04.110 --> 04:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
know that we have a good sense if the
 
04:03:05.870 --> 04:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
dollar amount changes will that increase
 
04:03:07.670 --> 04:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
contact will contact stay you know
 
04:03:10.269 --> 04:03:10.279 align:start position:0%
relative the same
 
04:03:10.279 --> 04:03:11.910 align:start position:0%
relative the same
um

04:03:11.910 --> 04:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:15.030 --> 04:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
but so it's a it's a bit of a it is a
 
04:03:16.349 --> 04:03:16.359 align:start position:0%
bit of a question if the dollar amount
 
04:03:18.670 --> 04:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
goes out will that increase uh contact I
 
04:03:20.269 --> 04:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
I do not know it's it's certainly
 
04:03:21.790 --> 04:03:21.800 align:start position:0%
possible and it's fair to raise those
 
04:03:23.189 --> 04:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
questions I think in contemplating
 
04:03:25.550 --> 04:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not you make the
 
04:03:29.309 --> 04:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
change my other concern is
 
04:03:34.910 --> 04:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh it was about fif 50 years since you
 
04:03:36.830 --> 04:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
they had the
 
04:03:40.550 --> 04:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
$300 and and bringing it up to $3,000
 
04:03:44.149 --> 04:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
how many more years will that stay there
 
04:03:46.950 --> 04:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
you know that's so maybe if we put the
 
04:03:50.189 --> 04:03:50.199 align:start position:0%
word by-weekly instead of a dollar
 
04:03:54.229 --> 04:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:58.710 --> 04:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
max no I have thoughts I I for one would
 
04:04:00.670 --> 04:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
prefer the dollar amount and if it gets
 
04:04:02.389 --> 04:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
stale um
 
04:04:05.269 --> 04:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
somebody someday ought to do this but I
 
04:04:07.550 --> 04:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
guess based on all the discussion we're
 
04:04:10.750 --> 04:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
having I think having it uh um
 
04:04:12.389 --> 04:04:12.399 align:start position:0%
potentially Ian because there were
 
04:04:15.510 --> 04:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
issues raised about um whether
 
04:04:17.189 --> 04:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
somebody's not on a regular payroll
 
04:04:18.670 --> 04:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
whether on commission or something like
 
04:04:21.790 --> 04:04:21.800 align:start position:0%
that I think putting a limit of 3,000
 
04:04:22.750 --> 04:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
because I'm sitting here thinking I
 
04:04:24.269 --> 04:04:24.279 align:start position:0%
don't want any higher than
 
04:04:27.189 --> 04:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
3,000 um it should be higher than 300
 
04:04:31.349 --> 04:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
3,000 seems fine but um if you if you
 
04:04:32.910 --> 04:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
start talking real money people are
 
04:04:36.030 --> 04:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
going to get more and more excited so I
 
04:04:37.670 --> 04:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
I just soon leave leave it at a dollar
 
04:04:37.680 --> 04:04:38.830 align:start position:0%
I just soon leave leave it at a dollar
amount

04:04:38.830 --> 04:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
amount
 
04:04:41.590 --> 04:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
and let it um you know basically put it
 
04:04:43.110 --> 04:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
on the department to bring this to our
 
04:04:48.710 --> 04:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:53.229 --> 04:04:53.239 align:start position:0%
years any follow up on that okay we
 
04:04:55.790 --> 04:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
know not a hypothetical question but do
 
04:04:58.229 --> 04:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
we need
 
04:05:01.710 --> 04:05:01.720 align:start position:0%
this I was thinking that too I I think
 
04:05:03.670 --> 04:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
that's a question that's appropriate for
 
04:05:05.670 --> 04:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
the committee and the and the commission
 
04:05:07.910 --> 04:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
to answer um I from the Department
 
04:05:10.510 --> 04:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
Department's perspective it's in the law
 
04:05:12.149 --> 04:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
it's one that we can administer the
 
04:05:14.110 --> 04:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
amendment as written we believe that we
 
04:05:16.870 --> 04:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
can administer um our interactions with
 
04:05:19.910 --> 04:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
it as noted are are compared to other
 
04:05:21.830 --> 04:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
interactions under other statutory
 
04:05:25.870 --> 04:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
Provisions are are smaller um not not a
 
04:05:28.229 --> 04:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
lot of contact I'm not aware of and I
 
04:05:29.550 --> 04:05:29.560 align:start position:0%
checked with our Inspection Division
 
04:05:30.990 --> 04:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
before coming over today I'm not aware
 
04:05:34.030 --> 04:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
of viations ever being found or at least
 
04:05:37.590 --> 04:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
not within recent years not that I'm
 
04:05:39.349 --> 04:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
aware aare of I'm not aware of wage
 
04:05:40.870 --> 04:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
claims that have been brought under this
 
04:05:43.070 --> 04:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
provision or addressing this provision
 
04:05:45.429 --> 04:05:45.439 align:start position:0%
and again questions seem to be oriented
 
04:05:47.070 --> 04:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
when they come to the department from
 
04:05:49.750 --> 04:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
employers uh around I want to make
 
04:05:52.590 --> 04:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
payment because I had a person pass am I
 
04:05:55.070 --> 04:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that and you know can I
 
04:05:56.670 --> 04:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
give it to this
 
04:05:56.680 --> 04:05:58.389 align:start position:0%
give it to this
person

04:05:58.389 --> 04:05:58.399 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:06:02.870 --> 04:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
so go ah could could in the absence of
 
04:06:05.149 --> 04:06:05.159 align:start position:0%
this you would still be able to
 
04:06:07.469 --> 04:06:07.479 align:start position:0%
administer payment of wages to the
 
04:06:09.790 --> 04:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
employe deceased employee according to
 
04:06:10.870 --> 04:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
policy and
 
04:06:13.670 --> 04:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
procedure listed in
 
04:06:17.269 --> 04:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
275 within seven days or 14 days within
 
04:06:20.429 --> 04:06:20.439 align:start position:0%
eight days or 15 days yes and if I
 
04:06:21.830 --> 04:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
understand in part what you're asking is
 
04:06:23.750 --> 04:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
if this provision did not exist what
 
04:06:26.030 --> 04:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
would it perhaps change they would
 
04:06:28.469 --> 04:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
remove the mechanism by which the
 
04:06:32.149 --> 04:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
dependence uh or what the the The
 
04:06:33.830 --> 04:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
Descendants is what they say in the
 
04:06:36.710 --> 04:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
statute but those next in line folks of
 
04:06:39.469 --> 04:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
being able to to make the request and
 
04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
get the payment um outside of that
 
04:06:44.269 --> 04:06:44.279 align:start position:0%
probate process so again this section
 
04:06:46.349 --> 04:06:46.359 align:start position:0%
does create a mechanism by which someone
 
04:06:48.710 --> 04:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
other than the employee specified
 
04:06:51.630 --> 04:06:51.640 align:start position:0%
persons is able to access some of wages
 
04:06:53.309 --> 04:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
that are due not the whole amount if
 
04:06:55.349 --> 04:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
it's an excess of 300 or 3,000 whatever
 
04:06:57.349 --> 04:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount is there's a mechanism
 
04:06:59.349 --> 04:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
whereby an employer can make that
 
04:07:01.389 --> 04:07:01.399 align:start position:0%
payment um I think if the section does
 
04:07:03.309 --> 04:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
not exist that mechanism would not exist
 
04:07:06.950 --> 04:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
anymore thank you and I've thought about
 
04:07:09.630 --> 04:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
that question my myself and I
 
04:07:13.189 --> 04:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
think there's another answer to that so
 
04:07:15.590 --> 04:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
this is written to be permissive this is
 
04:07:19.269 --> 04:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
when you can give this money if we
 
04:07:22.590 --> 04:07:22.600 align:start position:0%
repealed it in its entirety
 
04:07:25.550 --> 04:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
though it if you look at the Department
 
04:07:27.149 --> 04:07:27.159 align:start position:0%
of Labor wage and
 
04:07:30.189 --> 04:07:30.199 align:start position:0%
hour laws and rules they're really not
 
04:07:34.790 --> 04:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
permissive they're prohibitive that this
 
04:07:36.670 --> 04:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
if everything's fine and nobody has
 
04:07:38.510 --> 04:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
complaints it doesn't come to you it
 
04:07:40.750 --> 04:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
comes to you because somebody did
 
04:07:43.229 --> 04:07:43.239 align:start position:0%
something that they weren't supposed to
 
04:07:46.189 --> 04:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
so I think you also have to read this is
 
04:07:50.030 --> 04:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
what is it telling you not to do and it
 
04:07:53.229 --> 04:07:53.239 align:start position:0%
tells an employer that you cannot give
 
04:07:54.830 --> 04:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
more than
 
04:08:00.510 --> 04:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
$3,000 in in uh to uh dependent but that
 
04:08:02.630 --> 04:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
was wrong descendant I think it says um
 
04:08:05.349 --> 04:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
it tells the employer you cannot turn
 
04:08:07.790 --> 04:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
over this money if there's already a no
 
04:08:09.710 --> 04:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
a dependency of probate
 
04:08:13.389 --> 04:08:13.399 align:start position:0%
proceedings and I think
 
04:08:16.710 --> 04:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
that becomes
 
04:08:19.189 --> 04:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
important if you repeal it what you're
 
04:08:22.550 --> 04:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
also changing is you're opening up
 
04:08:24.910 --> 04:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
anything can happen anybody can come in
 
04:08:26.750 --> 04:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
come into an employer and ask for
 
04:08:29.510 --> 04:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
anything and the employer has to decide
 
04:08:31.670 --> 04:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
on their own well what I don't know what
 
04:08:33.550 --> 04:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
to do what am I going to
 
04:08:36.910 --> 04:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
do the department will now have no
 
04:08:38.750 --> 04:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
opinion what's what soever if someone
 
04:08:39.790 --> 04:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
comes and
 
04:08:42.389 --> 04:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
complains and says I
 
04:08:45.550 --> 04:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
think this employer did it
 
04:08:48.590 --> 04:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
wrong you have you have very little way
 
04:08:50.950 --> 04:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
of of adjudicating that because there
 
04:08:54.309 --> 04:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
there now is no longer a set of
 
04:08:58.109 --> 04:08:58.119 align:start position:0%
rules that they could have followed and
 
04:08:59.429 --> 04:08:59.439 align:start position:0%
so that's my
 
04:09:01.870 --> 04:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
concern with and I thought about that
 
04:09:03.910 --> 04:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
too does all this complic could we just
 
04:09:06.149 --> 04:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
repeal it now you know all the
 
04:09:09.070 --> 04:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
complication goes away and I think that
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
in practice that could open up more of
 
04:09:14.990 --> 04:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
all the issues that you're talking
 
04:09:19.630 --> 04:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
about than exist with the law in place
 
04:09:21.950 --> 04:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
Brian yeah
 
04:09:24.630 --> 04:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
um kind of losing my train of thought
 
04:09:29.389 --> 04:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
here um oh I know what it was If an
 
04:09:32.349 --> 04:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
employer became aware of this and they
 
04:09:37.630 --> 04:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
get a um uh a proper demand uh from a uh
 
04:09:40.269 --> 04:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
from the family um might just be the
 
04:09:42.830 --> 04:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
family in general and that employer came
 
04:09:44.830 --> 04:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
to the department and said we can't
 
04:09:46.630 --> 04:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
figure out who to give the money
 
04:09:49.109 --> 04:09:49.119 align:start position:0%
to would you
 
04:09:51.870 --> 04:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
help that is a very good question the
 
04:09:53.630 --> 04:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
department would help by providing
 
04:09:55.710 --> 04:09:55.720 align:start position:0%
guidance on what the statutory require
 
04:09:58.030 --> 04:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
or what the what the statute sets forth
 
04:09:59.229 --> 04:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
but if what they're asking the
 
04:10:02.269 --> 04:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
department is tell me who the right
 
04:10:04.750 --> 04:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
descendant is the Department's not
 
04:10:07.630 --> 04:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
really in the right entity nor in
 
04:10:10.630 --> 04:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
position to necessarily know that so we
 
04:10:13.189 --> 04:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
might Point them towards resources um we
 
04:10:16.429 --> 04:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
might Point them towards the in in I
 
04:10:18.830 --> 04:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
can't say it in testy statute we might
 
04:10:20.710 --> 04:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
suggest that they seek guidance if
 
04:10:23.269 --> 04:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
that's needed um I think that would be
 
04:10:25.469 --> 04:10:25.479 align:start position:0%
bordering potentially on some form of
 
04:10:27.389 --> 04:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
legal advice because you're giving an
 
04:10:30.389 --> 04:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
opinion at that point about oh yes it's
 
04:10:32.189 --> 04:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
the spouse it's the son it's the
 
04:10:35.189 --> 04:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
daughter um when you when you said
 
04:10:37.750 --> 04:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
resources what does that mean uh legal
 
04:10:40.109 --> 04:10:40.119 align:start position:0%
resources we you know can we will refer
 
04:10:42.269 --> 04:10:42.279 align:start position:0%
to other agents other agencies in
 
04:10:44.269 --> 04:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
certain scenarios if the ideas you need
 
04:10:47.030 --> 04:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
to maybe talk to the free legal service
 
04:10:48.550 --> 04:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
there are free legal services out there
 
04:10:52.389 --> 04:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
that will give um you know legal advice
 
04:10:54.469 --> 04:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
on short-term basis is that people are
 
04:10:58.309 --> 04:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
able to access um pointing them towards
 
04:11:00.030 --> 04:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
whatever resource we may have available
 
04:11:02.109 --> 04:11:02.119 align:start position:0%
to help them sort out that piece of the
 
04:11:04.429 --> 04:11:04.439 align:start position:0%
question but I don't believe that the
 
04:11:05.750 --> 04:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
Department's role and we are not
 
04:11:08.910 --> 04:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
currently saying oh it is this person we
 
04:11:11.389 --> 04:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
do try to um counsel the employer on
 
04:11:12.950 --> 04:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
make certain again there is a
 
04:11:14.670 --> 04:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
requirement here that it's got to follow
 
04:11:16.469 --> 04:11:16.479 align:start position:0%
the laws of the anesty of the State of
 
04:11:19.109 --> 04:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there's an order to those
 
04:11:20.309 --> 04:11:20.319 align:start position:0%
things you want to make certain that
 
04:11:21.950 --> 04:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
it's the right person before you make
 
04:11:23.870 --> 04:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
payment because have you if you go make
 
04:11:25.590 --> 04:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
payment to the wrong
 
04:11:27.910 --> 04:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
person did the payment actually happen
 
04:11:29.109 --> 04:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
whether it goes through the probate or
 
04:11:30.349 --> 04:11:30.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't go through the probate so make
 
04:11:31.469 --> 04:11:31.479 align:start position:0%
sure it's the right person if your
 
04:11:33.990 --> 04:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
intent is to do this but we would not be
 
04:11:36.229 --> 04:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
making a determination or giving them an
 
04:11:39.550 --> 04:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
opinion on oh this is the right person
 
04:11:42.349 --> 04:11:42.359 align:start position:0%
and going back to the point of do we
 
04:11:44.429 --> 04:11:44.439 align:start position:0%
need this
 
04:11:47.229 --> 04:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
um if what the person would really need
 
04:11:49.109 --> 04:11:49.119 align:start position:0%
to interpret
 
04:11:51.830 --> 04:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
561 is uh a legal
 
04:11:54.750 --> 04:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
opinion um the legal opinion may very
 
04:11:57.670 --> 04:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
well take a long enough period of time
 
04:12:00.429 --> 04:12:00.439 align:start position:0%
that by the time it comes the probate's
 
04:12:02.630 --> 04:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
underway and so now the employer can't
 
04:12:05.229 --> 04:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
pay it anyways or has already paid it to
 
04:12:07.389 --> 04:12:07.399 align:start position:0%
the account or whatever but you know in
 
04:12:08.990 --> 04:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
order to stay within timelines they
 
04:12:12.710 --> 04:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
would need to move that money um but if
 
04:12:14.990 --> 04:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
they if it can't be figured out who to
 
04:12:18.550 --> 04:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
pay it to then they will simply have to
 
04:12:21.550 --> 04:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
um pay it to the estate or the the
 
04:12:24.030 --> 04:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
employer the deceased employees account
 
04:12:27.030 --> 04:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
and uh be done with it so I'm not sure
 
04:12:31.269 --> 04:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
if this is functionally uh something
 
04:12:34.189 --> 04:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:38.269 --> 04:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
well thank you and I I do have that
 
04:12:41.030 --> 04:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
question myself things have changed
 
04:12:43.469 --> 04:12:43.479 align:start position:0%
quite a bit since
 
04:12:46.830 --> 04:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
1963 when maybe people were going to the
 
04:12:50.109 --> 04:12:50.119 align:start position:0%
cash window and and getting money to get
 
04:12:51.469 --> 04:12:51.479 align:start position:0%
to get their money at the end of the
 
04:12:54.030 --> 04:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
week um and now
 
04:12:56.309 --> 04:12:56.319 align:start position:0%
everything almost everybody at our
 
04:13:00.309 --> 04:13:00.319 align:start position:0%
number 98% of people are doing direct
 
04:13:00.319 --> 04:13:02.429 align:start position:0%
number 98% of people are doing direct
deposit

04:13:02.429 --> 04:13:02.439 align:start position:0%
deposit
 
04:13:06.309 --> 04:13:06.319 align:start position:0%
um is there even room in that process if
 
04:13:09.189 --> 04:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
you are paying wages on time they get in
 
04:13:12.109 --> 04:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
there and say oh something happened
 
04:13:15.189 --> 04:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
we've got to do things differently or is
 
04:13:17.990 --> 04:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
it almost all of the time going to fall
 
04:13:20.670 --> 04:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
into the direct deposit and be in that
 
04:13:22.670 --> 04:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
account to be dealt with by and and one
 
04:13:22.680 --> 04:13:23.750 align:start position:0%
account to be dealt with by and and one
further

04:13:23.750 --> 04:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:13:27.149 --> 04:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
point this is not something that we are
 
04:13:29.469 --> 04:13:29.479 align:start position:0%
not fixing a problem that was presented
 
04:13:31.870 --> 04:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
to us this is we are fixing a problem
 
04:13:33.349 --> 04:13:33.359 align:start position:0%
that we dug
 
04:13:36.670 --> 04:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
up um and no one has ever come to us and
 
04:13:38.750 --> 04:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
said this is a real problem we can't
 
04:13:40.990 --> 04:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
live with uh this way in New Hampshire
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
we've got it this needs to be fixed
 
04:13:48.070 --> 04:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
um the uh the study committee found it
 
04:13:49.590 --> 04:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
thought it was a little bit odd that it
 
04:13:52.550 --> 04:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
was only 300 bucks there's a reason for
 
04:13:54.630 --> 04:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
that um but it's not like someone has
 
04:13:58.630 --> 04:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
said this isn't working and the question
 
04:14:02.349 --> 04:14:02.359 align:start position:0%
for us is will this work and with direct
 
04:14:05.229 --> 04:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
deposit I'm not sure it will the money's
 
04:14:07.309 --> 04:14:07.319 align:start position:0%
going to be in the account by the the
 
04:14:09.790 --> 04:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
time the request
 
04:14:13.950 --> 04:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
comes and in response to that does it
 
04:14:17.670 --> 04:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
work in my opinion it still works and it
 
04:14:19.950 --> 04:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
it's something you said earlier that
 
04:14:23.910 --> 04:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
may might any employer if they call
 
04:14:25.990 --> 04:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
their lawyer they'll say don't touch it
 
04:14:28.149 --> 04:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
just put it in Let It Go through direct
 
04:14:31.349 --> 04:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
deposit and to me that's an option an
 
04:14:33.469 --> 04:14:33.479 align:start position:0%
employer can say I
 
04:14:36.510 --> 04:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
don't this is this is above my pay grade
 
04:14:39.389 --> 04:14:39.399 align:start position:0%
I don't want to get into that and
 
04:14:44.830 --> 04:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
likewise 99% of the time lawyer advice
 
04:14:49.389 --> 04:14:49.399 align:start position:0%
to that end or not the money is going to
 
04:14:52.630 --> 04:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
do what it's going to do and this
 
04:14:55.870 --> 04:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
provision would never get invoked does
 
04:14:59.429 --> 04:14:59.439 align:start position:0%
that mean it's a problem to allow it to
 
04:15:04.389 --> 04:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
be invokable I I don't think so
 
04:15:07.630 --> 04:15:07.640 align:start position:0%
um on the other hand and this goes back
 
04:15:10.870 --> 04:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
to what would happen if you
 
04:15:14.149 --> 04:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
repeal if you really want this law to
 
04:15:15.990 --> 04:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
kind of go away because you think it's a
 
04:15:17.830 --> 04:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
relic of the past maybe the best thing
 
04:15:20.790 --> 04:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
to do is not touch it because right now
 
04:15:25.630 --> 04:15:25.640 align:start position:0%
$300 almost nobody can even affect that
 
04:15:28.830 --> 04:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
and as inflation arose that away
 
04:15:31.950 --> 04:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
it the law eventually just says you
 
04:15:35.349 --> 04:15:35.359 align:start position:0%
can't ever ask for money directly it
 
04:15:37.590 --> 04:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
always has to go through probate
 
04:15:40.389 --> 04:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
because the amount that applies under
 
04:15:43.910 --> 04:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
here is so small but and I I suppose
 
04:15:45.910 --> 04:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
that's another thing is amended to just
 
04:15:50.469 --> 04:15:50.479 align:start position:0%
say you can't do it um but
 
04:15:53.389 --> 04:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
that's I think it would be if that's the
 
04:15:54.750 --> 04:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
if that's really what we're after it
 
04:15:58.389 --> 04:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
would be safer to leave it untouched and
 
04:16:05.910 --> 04:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
course know so we just take the dollars
 
04:16:14.670 --> 04:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:18.990 --> 04:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:21.710 --> 04:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
what after demand be paid with payment
 
04:16:23.269 --> 04:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
made in the order of distribution set
 
04:16:25.950 --> 04:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
forth 561 call and one take out
 
04:16:25.960 --> 04:16:27.910 align:start position:0%
forth 561 call and one take out
everything

04:16:27.910 --> 04:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
everything
 
04:16:31.429 --> 04:16:31.439 align:start position:0%
else so you think that amount that
 
04:16:33.469 --> 04:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
someone could demand should be
 
04:16:35.429 --> 04:16:35.439 align:start position:0%
unlimited there should be no they
 
04:16:38.269 --> 04:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it should go either write into
 
04:16:41.349 --> 04:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
the it should go to the employee or to
 
04:16:41.359 --> 04:16:43.349 align:start position:0%
the it should go to the employee or to
his

04:16:43.349 --> 04:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
his
 
04:16:45.750 --> 04:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
probate if it goes the employee goes to
 
04:16:48.630 --> 04:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
probate right so either way that the
 
04:16:50.830 --> 04:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
employer is covered by not making a
 
04:16:54.229 --> 04:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
mistake by following the May or no man
 
04:16:57.309 --> 04:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
so and this is why I'm unclear the
 
04:17:02.030 --> 04:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
reference to RSA 561 colon one says what
 
04:17:04.030 --> 04:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
you do if there is no will and there is
 
04:17:04.040 --> 04:17:05.429 align:start position:0%
you do if there is no will and there is
no

04:17:05.429 --> 04:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:17:08.510 --> 04:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
probate if there there's a will or
 
04:17:12.030 --> 04:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
probate and that's what this not being a
 
04:17:15.229 --> 04:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
lawyer I'm probably not entirely right
 
04:17:18.510 --> 04:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
about this but a phrase letters of
 
04:17:20.750 --> 04:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
testamentary or of
 
04:17:23.910 --> 04:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
administration as far as I can tell not
 
04:17:27.630 --> 04:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
being an expert those are the results
 
04:17:29.550 --> 04:17:29.560 align:start position:0%
those are the orders that come out of
 
04:17:33.229 --> 04:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
probate um and one has to do with with
 
04:17:36.189 --> 04:17:36.199 align:start position:0%
the execution of the will and the other
 
04:17:37.670 --> 04:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
has to do with with the
 
04:17:41.229 --> 04:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
Probate Court saying there was no will
 
04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:47.040 --> 04:17:49.429 align:start position:0%
 
order

04:17:49.429 --> 04:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
order
 
04:17:53.710 --> 04:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
so that keeping the last sentence that's
 
04:17:56.149 --> 04:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
telling you how to give the money out on
 
04:17:59.149 --> 04:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
your own without any guidance and what
 
04:18:02.070 --> 04:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
you're saying is you don't don't want
 
04:18:05.109 --> 04:18:05.119 align:start position:0%
that at all so it would be the last
 
04:18:09.109 --> 04:18:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
um and I I don't know quite how you
 
04:18:14.229 --> 04:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
would reward it that you would change
 
04:18:18.550 --> 04:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
the mate to a may not I guess no we we
 
04:18:20.030 --> 04:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
can probably get rid it should be just a
 
04:18:22.030 --> 04:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
sentence now now that I'm hearing what
 
04:18:25.109 --> 04:18:25.119 align:start position:0%
you're saying um with the direction of
 
04:18:26.830 --> 04:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
the department
 
04:18:29.070 --> 04:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
to in the event of the death of an
 
04:18:31.670 --> 04:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
employee wages due to the decedent shall
 
04:18:34.109 --> 04:18:34.119 align:start position:0%
be paid according to
 
04:18:37.950 --> 04:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
274 within the 8 days or 14 days
 
04:18:41.830 --> 04:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
after they're deceased to be you know or
 
04:18:43.870 --> 04:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
or policies and procedures relating to
 
04:18:43.880 --> 04:18:45.630 align:start position:0%
or policies and procedures relating to
the

04:18:45.630 --> 04:18:45.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
employment think that they would be paid
 
04:18:50.750 --> 04:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
Into the Now deceased person's however
 
04:18:52.309 --> 04:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
the deceased person was Prior getting
 
04:18:54.670 --> 04:18:54.680 align:start position:0%
paid right that's what you're proposing
 
04:18:57.389 --> 04:18:57.399 align:start position:0%
the only the only thing that may be of
 
04:19:00.109 --> 04:19:00.119 align:start position:0%
value to look at is if it is now known
 
04:19:03.550 --> 04:19:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:06.269 --> 04:19:06.279 align:start position:0%
deceased does that affect and I don't
 
04:19:07.910 --> 04:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
know the answer to this I'm not an
 
04:19:12.710 --> 04:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
expert in in um wrapup of of Affairs or
 
04:19:16.189 --> 04:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
or um after people are deceased what go
 
04:19:17.750 --> 04:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know what goes to probate when how
 
04:19:19.070 --> 04:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's triggered how long it takes so
 
04:19:22.389 --> 04:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
forgive me on that part um if if
 
04:19:23.790 --> 04:19:23.800 align:start position:0%
something comes forward and somebody's
 
04:19:26.349 --> 04:19:26.359 align:start position:0%
either contesting the will or there is
 
04:19:28.550 --> 04:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
no will or there is no probate we've got
 
04:19:30.670 --> 04:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
a line of people looking to make claims
 
04:19:32.670 --> 04:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
is that going to freeze up I don't know
 
04:19:34.469 --> 04:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
if that freezes up the account or makes
 
04:19:36.469 --> 04:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
makes it impossible for the how I think
 
04:19:37.349 --> 04:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
you you'd have to look at how's the
 
04:19:39.149 --> 04:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
employer going to make that payment if
 
04:19:41.670 --> 04:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
something has uh been put forward and
 
04:19:43.229 --> 04:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
there's disputes and it's not going
 
04:19:45.269 --> 04:19:45.279 align:start position:0%
through probate and there's not a not a
 
04:19:47.269 --> 04:19:47.279 align:start position:0%
will not sure how that would work to be
 
04:19:49.550 --> 04:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
honest um it may not have any effect but
 
04:19:51.830 --> 04:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's a piece to look at or to
 
04:19:53.030 --> 04:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
consider if that's the change that
 
04:19:56.630 --> 04:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
you're considering I I had a member
 
04:19:59.469 --> 04:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
suggests to me that so suppose it's a
 
04:20:01.309 --> 04:20:01.319 align:start position:0%
joint account that the checks are going
 
04:20:04.469 --> 04:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
into and that joint account holder is
 
04:20:07.070 --> 04:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
not entitled to any money under the will
 
04:20:11.309 --> 04:20:11.319 align:start position:0%
or the probate could that potentially
 
04:20:15.149 --> 04:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
by forcing that money the employer to
 
04:20:16.950 --> 04:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
make that deposit and then be
 
04:20:19.269 --> 04:20:19.279 align:start position:0%
distributed to the wrong person could
 
04:20:21.429 --> 04:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
that actually put the employer on the
 
04:20:24.070 --> 04:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
hook for misallocate
 
04:20:27.030 --> 04:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm not trying to ask you to answer
 
04:20:29.469 --> 04:20:29.479 align:start position:0%
it but it was it was kind of a different
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
way of looking at it we're kind of
 
04:20:33.590 --> 04:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
assuming that in most cases if the money
 
04:20:36.710 --> 04:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
just goes in direct deposit the system
 
04:20:38.830 --> 04:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
that's intended to handle it would deal
 
04:20:41.790 --> 04:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
with it but there are
 
04:20:45.389 --> 04:20:45.399 align:start position:0%
those um kind of rare
 
04:20:48.030 --> 04:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
cases where there is no direct deposit
 
04:20:50.070 --> 04:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
that someone gets paid with a p for
 
04:20:52.590 --> 04:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
check we bring up another bill that we
 
04:20:57.910 --> 04:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
have or by cash or by or by cash right
 
04:21:01.790 --> 04:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
and and so in that
 
04:21:05.670 --> 04:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
case and I and I and I've said it before
 
04:21:08.429 --> 04:21:08.439 align:start position:0%
but I'll repeat I think if you look at
 
04:21:10.469 --> 04:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
when this was written that was probably
 
04:21:13.590 --> 04:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
the norm not the exception now it's the
 
04:21:17.950 --> 04:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
exception but it's not unheard of
 
04:21:20.590 --> 04:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
that there could be an EMP employer
 
04:21:23.550 --> 04:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
sitting there with cash they don't know
 
04:21:27.990 --> 04:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
who to give it to um and if the deceased
 
04:21:30.990 --> 04:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
employees wife came in to collect it it
 
04:21:32.630 --> 04:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
would be very nice if they could just
 
04:21:36.950 --> 04:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
say all right I'm done here it is
 
04:21:40.590 --> 04:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
if I may um that appears to be what this
 
04:21:42.670 --> 04:21:42.680 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to do is to make it so
 
04:21:45.910 --> 04:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
that that employer can choose that
 
04:21:48.550 --> 04:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
option right um the concern that I would
 
04:21:50.910 --> 04:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
have and again you would have to you
 
04:21:52.790 --> 04:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
really focus on probate law and
 
04:21:54.790 --> 04:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
representative infantine obviously has
 
04:21:56.990 --> 04:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
more experience in it than I do but the
 
04:21:58.389 --> 04:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
concern that I would have is if the
 
04:22:01.149 --> 04:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
employer has knowledge that this claim
 
04:22:02.870 --> 04:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
or this employee is
 
04:22:07.149 --> 04:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
deceased and still issues payment into
 
04:22:09.790 --> 04:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's a joint account or not but
 
04:22:11.830 --> 04:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
still issues payment into a bank account
 
04:22:15.309 --> 04:22:15.319 align:start position:0%
or or um a or pay card or whatever it is
 
04:22:17.550 --> 04:22:17.560 align:start position:0%
I think that that's more of a problem
 
04:22:20.109 --> 04:22:20.119 align:start position:0%
when it comes to probating at what point
 
04:22:22.030 --> 04:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
in time and representative infanti might
 
04:22:23.910 --> 04:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
be able to answer this question better
 
04:22:27.790 --> 04:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
at what point in time is the money does
 
04:22:29.830 --> 04:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
it have to go into probate because the
 
04:22:33.630 --> 04:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
person is no longer alive versus we've
 
04:22:35.030 --> 04:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
always been putting it into his direct
 
04:22:37.469 --> 04:22:37.479 align:start position:0%
deposit so that's what I'm going to do
 
04:22:39.349 --> 04:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
even though I know he's
 
04:22:41.830 --> 04:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
deceased so I I don't know the answer to
 
04:22:44.389 --> 04:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
that question um and that might actually
 
04:22:46.990 --> 04:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
trigger the requirement of a probate to
 
04:22:50.750 --> 04:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:53.990 --> 04:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
distribution normally everything
 
04:22:56.149 --> 04:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
stops if you find out one of your
 
04:22:58.269 --> 04:22:58.279 align:start position:0%
employees is deceased you're supposed to
 
04:23:00.070 --> 04:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
stop direct
 
04:23:02.590 --> 04:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
deposit because at that date it's no
 
04:23:05.030 --> 04:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
longer the individual it's the
 
04:23:07.189 --> 04:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
estate okay
 
04:23:09.269 --> 04:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
um does that happen in real
 
04:23:11.830 --> 04:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
life probably not in some circumstances
 
04:23:13.189 --> 04:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
but technically that's what's supposed
 
04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
to happen so that would still be um part
 
04:23:21.510 --> 04:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
of the probate case as our all assets
 
04:23:23.510 --> 04:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
the the the instantaneous time the
 
04:23:24.910 --> 04:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
person no longer
 
04:23:24.920 --> 04:23:29.070 align:start position:0%
person no longer
exists

04:23:29.070 --> 04:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:32.950 --> 04:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
um again it can be accounted
 
04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
for in the inventory and it can be
 
04:23:39.670 --> 04:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
accounted for in the
 
04:23:44.389 --> 04:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
um income the whatever quarterly uh
 
04:23:47.950 --> 04:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:51.469 --> 04:23:51.479 align:start position:0%
filings but my issue is the reason why
 
04:23:52.910 --> 04:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
you have
 
04:23:52.920 --> 04:23:55.189 align:start position:0%
you have
this

04:23:55.189 --> 04:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:23:58.030 --> 04:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility is because by the time you
 
04:23:59.950 --> 04:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
get this checked and by the time you set
 
04:24:03.950 --> 04:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
up a checking account for the probate
 
04:24:07.630 --> 04:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
and by the time you get the application
 
04:24:09.389 --> 04:24:09.399 align:start position:0%
get a hearing date get the judge to
 
04:24:11.309 --> 04:24:11.319 align:start position:0%
request a bond get all this
 
04:24:16.189 --> 04:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
stuff people need the money and
 
04:24:19.429 --> 04:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
um now what happens in a lot of
 
04:24:22.349 --> 04:24:22.359 align:start position:0%
circumstances it's a spouse it's a joint
 
04:24:25.229 --> 04:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
checking account it goes in there anyway
 
04:24:27.349 --> 04:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:24:30.269 --> 04:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
happens um but technically if everyone's
 
04:24:31.630 --> 04:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
following the law
 
04:24:35.149 --> 04:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
Brian the employer really should
 
04:24:38.790 --> 04:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
not provide any check anymore after the
 
04:24:40.229 --> 04:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
person passes
 
04:24:43.349 --> 04:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
away um to the direct deposit because
 
04:24:45.590 --> 04:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
that person's no longer and they should
 
04:24:47.109 --> 04:24:47.119 align:start position:0%
just hold that money until the directed
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
where to say correct and this this this
 
04:24:51.469 --> 04:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
the reason for this bill probably the
 
04:24:55.070 --> 04:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
reason for this law 50 years
 
04:24:55.080 --> 04:24:57.070 align:start position:0%
reason for this law 50 years
ago

04:24:57.070 --> 04:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
ago
 
04:24:59.550 --> 04:24:59.560 align:start position:0%
was to not have to wait for all that
 
04:25:02.830 --> 04:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
stuff to happen and and so you know
 
04:25:04.149 --> 04:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
someone had you know some of these
 
04:25:06.590 --> 04:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
people they need they need that
 
04:25:08.269 --> 04:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
right and and I think the amount before
 
04:25:09.630 --> 04:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
they even get social security benefit
 
04:25:12.550 --> 04:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
spous sping benefits even 50 years ago
 
04:25:16.149 --> 04:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
$300 wasn't a huge amount of money um
 
04:25:18.710 --> 04:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
and $3,000 today is not a huge amount of
 
04:25:22.030 --> 04:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
money um and if an employer I mean
 
04:25:23.630 --> 04:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of employers who really
 
04:25:25.750 --> 04:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
get get busted up over the fact that
 
04:25:28.070 --> 04:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
their employee passed away um and they
 
04:25:30.469 --> 04:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
may want to do this even if there's some
 
04:25:35.070 --> 04:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
risk involved um and
 
04:25:35.080 --> 04:25:38.070 align:start position:0%
risk involved um and
um

04:25:38.070 --> 04:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:40.109 --> 04:25:40.119 align:start position:0%
you know they just have to somehow and
 
04:25:43.070 --> 04:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
it might be Rel in many instances it
 
04:25:44.830 --> 04:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
might be relatively easy to figure out
 
04:25:48.189 --> 04:25:48.199 align:start position:0%
who who who's entitled to the money um
 
04:25:49.910 --> 04:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
and you might want to just verify that
 
04:25:53.870 --> 04:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
you're doing it right with legal counsel
 
04:25:57.710 --> 04:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
um and then cut the
 
04:25:57.720 --> 04:26:02.950 align:start position:0%
um and then cut the
check

04:26:02.950 --> 04:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:06.910 --> 04:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
um and to that if I read
 
04:26:10.469 --> 04:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
uh 561 col one the first line is if the
 
04:26:12.510 --> 04:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
deceased is survived by a spouse the
 
04:26:16.269 --> 04:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
spouse shall receive so in that most of
 
04:26:19.630 --> 04:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
the time it's very you don't have to go
 
04:26:22.429 --> 04:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
down what's next if there is a spouse
 
04:26:24.830 --> 04:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
then that's and and if it gets more
 
04:26:26.229 --> 04:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
complicated that might be your trigger
 
04:26:30.469 --> 04:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:35.030 --> 04:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
right um I do and it as an if I'm an
 
04:26:38.109 --> 04:26:38.119 align:start position:0%
employer so I'm getting ready to hit
 
04:26:41.070 --> 04:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
approve on my payroll on Thursday night
 
04:26:43.590 --> 04:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
and someone comes running in and I said
 
04:26:48.429 --> 04:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:51.469 --> 04:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
died how
 
04:26:55.830 --> 04:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
much legal advice and bills am I taking
 
04:26:58.630 --> 04:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
on by not hitting s so now I have this
 
04:27:01.189 --> 04:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
money the monies do the employee but now
 
04:27:02.990 --> 04:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
I can't I don't have an employee to send
 
04:27:03.000 --> 04:27:03.990 align:start position:0%
I can't I don't have an employee to send
it

04:27:03.990 --> 04:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:27:07.070 --> 04:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
to I don't know where to send it to the
 
04:27:08.670 --> 04:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
estate because that hasn't been
 
04:27:11.149 --> 04:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
established yet but that money was it
 
04:27:12.830 --> 04:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
was due it's now
 
04:27:16.910 --> 04:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
overdue um according to payroll laws it
 
04:27:20.269 --> 04:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
almost seems like having an out where an
 
04:27:23.710 --> 04:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
employer can unload that last bit of
 
04:27:27.389 --> 04:27:27.399 align:start position:0%
money that is too small to really make
 
04:27:29.429 --> 04:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
it worth fighting over but could be
 
04:27:31.349 --> 04:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
really a mess for that employer if
 
04:27:33.389 --> 04:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
they're waiting to be told what to do
 
04:27:36.030 --> 04:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
with it it it seems like that's another
 
04:27:39.229 --> 04:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
protection that this has to the employer
 
04:27:40.990 --> 04:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
is saying if the money is small enough
 
04:27:44.349 --> 04:27:44.359 align:start position:0%
and you know who to give it to you can
 
04:27:48.790 --> 04:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
just issue the check and and you're done
 
04:27:51.429 --> 04:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
now now somebody else is dealing with
 
04:27:54.790 --> 04:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:57.349 --> 04:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
problems again what's supposed to happen
 
04:27:59.349 --> 04:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
and what does
 
04:28:03.469 --> 04:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
happen um a vast majority have a spouse
 
04:28:05.349 --> 04:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes you have a younger person that
 
04:28:08.030 --> 04:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:11.070 --> 04:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
a child who has no girlfriend boyfriend
 
04:28:14.790 --> 04:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
spouse engagement or anything um I've
 
04:28:21.189 --> 04:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:24.070 --> 04:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh no one knew what to do would it then
 
04:28:25.070 --> 04:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
go to the
 
04:28:27.830 --> 04:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
parent yeah
 
04:28:27.840 --> 04:28:30.149 align:start position:0%
parent yeah
actually

04:28:30.149 --> 04:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:28:33.189 --> 04:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
yes and then this has the next provision
 
04:28:35.309 --> 04:28:35.319 align:start position:0%
is what happens if there is no surviving
 
04:28:38.590 --> 04:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
issue or parent or spouse because that
 
04:28:41.030 --> 04:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
was already then it goes to the entire
 
04:28:43.109 --> 04:28:43.119 align:start position:0%
estate which basically puts it right
 
04:28:44.630 --> 04:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
back in Pro
 
04:28:47.510 --> 04:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
right I I think the goal of the original
 
04:28:52.750 --> 04:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
bill was to try to Pro I could be wrong
 
04:28:56.109 --> 04:28:56.119 align:start position:0%
but initially reading this the $300
 
04:28:58.109 --> 04:28:58.119 align:start position:0%
amount was
 
04:29:00.229 --> 04:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
there because if that's the only thing
 
04:29:03.590 --> 04:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
the person had kind of a voids probate
 
04:29:07.309 --> 04:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
for a paycheck um and that it provides
 
04:29:10.109 --> 04:29:10.119 align:start position:0%
the employer an ability to pay someone
 
04:29:11.630 --> 04:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
who comes comes to them and says look we
 
04:29:13.510 --> 04:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
don't have any money can't even bury the
 
04:29:15.790 --> 04:29:15.800 align:start position:0%
person you know and prob it's going to
 
04:29:19.830 --> 04:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
take a month you know can you can you
 
04:29:21.510 --> 04:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
give us can you give us a paycheck so we
 
04:29:23.429 --> 04:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
can do whatever because any employer
 
04:29:25.830 --> 04:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
normally would say I can't do that the
 
04:29:28.070 --> 04:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
employer employee no longer exists
 
04:29:31.070 --> 04:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
legally so it has to go to the
 
04:29:31.080 --> 04:29:33.550 align:start position:0%
legally so it has to go to the
estate

04:29:33.550 --> 04:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
estate
 
04:29:37.510 --> 04:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
um so you know it all depends how
 
04:29:40.109 --> 04:29:40.119 align:start position:0%
formal these Estates are I mean some are
 
04:29:41.790 --> 04:29:41.800 align:start position:0%
very informal they never even inform the
 
04:29:43.670 --> 04:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
courts and the other spouse just takes
 
04:29:45.950 --> 04:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
everything and and they have a death
 
04:29:47.389 --> 04:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
certificate and if there's a mortgage or
 
04:29:48.910 --> 04:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
whatever they deal with it that way so
 
04:29:50.830 --> 04:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
you know you're talking and and loo I
 
04:29:52.269 --> 04:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
don't like yours because you take
 
04:29:54.550 --> 04:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
someone that makes $250,000 a year who
 
04:29:56.870 --> 04:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
gets bonused out another $100,000 a year
 
04:29:58.389 --> 04:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
and and at the end of the thing the guy
 
04:30:00.429 --> 04:30:00.439 align:start position:0%
say okay his bonus at the end of the
 
04:30:03.109 --> 04:30:03.119 align:start position:0%
year is another 100 Grand and so here's
 
04:30:07.309 --> 04:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
$125,000 I think that's a little much
 
04:30:10.870 --> 04:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
well you mean have a no number correct
 
04:30:13.149 --> 04:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
oh just no number because it all comes
 
04:30:15.070 --> 04:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
questions all come from the
 
04:30:18.630 --> 04:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
employer so say we can make this easy
 
04:30:19.990 --> 04:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
enough that an employer doesn't have to
 
04:30:22.630 --> 04:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
call the do or engage legal council and
 
04:30:24.149 --> 04:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
how to make the last
 
04:30:26.950 --> 04:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
payment you know we can certainly cap it
 
04:30:29.229 --> 04:30:29.239 align:start position:0%
but if it's wages due it's wages due
 
04:30:30.790 --> 04:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's to their checking account
 
04:30:31.910 --> 04:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's through their spouse or
 
04:30:34.149 --> 04:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
whether it's through their estate and
 
04:30:36.590 --> 04:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
with the employer
 
04:30:39.670 --> 04:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
at holding that till they get would
 
04:30:42.349 --> 04:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
would they would they be subject to a a
 
04:30:45.710 --> 04:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
wage claim and B if they ever ever had a
 
04:30:48.910 --> 04:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
you know inspection would they be could
 
04:30:52.189 --> 04:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
they be fed for that I think after
 
04:30:54.429 --> 04:30:54.439 align:start position:0%
they're due quite frankly I think this
 
04:30:57.070 --> 04:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
gives the employer more of an out than I
 
04:30:58.630 --> 04:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
know you were talking about protections
 
04:31:00.429 --> 04:31:00.439 align:start position:0%
if I give the check and then some other
 
04:31:03.269 --> 04:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
surviving person who has owed money or
 
04:31:06.349 --> 04:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
or debtor uh can come after you
 
04:31:08.590 --> 04:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
um I think this provides them protection
 
04:31:09.630 --> 04:31:09.640 align:start position:0%
I know you're concerned about the
 
04:31:10.990 --> 04:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
protection of them I think the law
 
04:31:14.349 --> 04:31:14.359 align:start position:0%
allowing that provides the
 
04:31:17.389 --> 04:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
protection especially if an insolvent
 
04:31:22.510 --> 04:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
estate but I'm not a lawyer play one on
 
04:31:24.870 --> 04:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
TV um let's put it this way someone
 
04:31:27.870 --> 04:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
already decided the law was okay at $300
 
04:31:30.109 --> 04:31:30.119 align:start position:0%
right 50 years
 
04:31:34.630 --> 04:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
ago um but we have direct POS I
 
04:31:37.309 --> 04:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
understand then have all the excess laws
 
04:31:38.950 --> 04:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
but even direct deposit quite frankly
 
04:31:41.710 --> 04:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
pressing that button as Brian example
 
04:31:45.750 --> 04:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
that law allows that yeah because
 
04:31:47.990 --> 04:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
technically being being what I know
 
04:31:50.590 --> 04:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
about being the law on
 
04:31:52.830 --> 04:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
probate person's dead you can't send it
 
04:31:56.109 --> 04:31:56.119 align:start position:0%
to them this this allows the employer to
 
04:31:56.119 --> 04:31:59.550 align:start position:0%
to them this this allows the employer to
do

04:31:59.550 --> 04:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:01.710 --> 04:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
that so you got a husband a wife and a
 
04:32:03.030 --> 04:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
joint checking account it's direct
 
04:32:06.389 --> 04:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
deposit right technically the way I know
 
04:32:10.950 --> 04:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
Pro B and get a lawyer is that you can't
 
04:32:13.269 --> 04:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
do that as soon as that person dies that
 
04:32:15.429 --> 04:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
that money has to go in the state so
 
04:32:17.309 --> 04:32:17.319 align:start position:0%
where is that written for an employer to
 
04:32:20.830 --> 04:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
follow I think by allowing that
 
04:32:23.550 --> 04:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
$300 you're giving the employer the
 
04:32:26.389 --> 04:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
ability to do that law says I can do it
 
04:32:29.910 --> 04:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
for $3,000 I did it no but if you you're
 
04:32:31.469 --> 04:32:31.479 align:start position:0%
supposed to pay the employee because
 
04:32:33.710 --> 04:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
those those are wages do the employee
 
04:32:35.229 --> 04:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
not after they die right but if you
 
04:32:37.189 --> 04:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
don't don't know they're dead no if you
 
04:32:40.349 --> 04:32:40.359 align:start position:0%
don't know they then it still gives you
 
04:32:42.590 --> 04:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
right but I mean if it's I just want to
 
04:32:44.149 --> 04:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're we're actually
 
04:32:45.870 --> 04:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
coming bringing this law up to the times
 
04:32:47.670 --> 04:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
and I I want to go back to something you
 
04:32:50.070 --> 04:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
said you don't hear about this and why
 
04:32:51.590 --> 04:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
don't you hear about it because if
 
04:32:53.910 --> 04:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
nobody has an issue nobody's going to
 
04:32:56.309 --> 04:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
come into the Department of Labor and
 
04:32:59.389 --> 04:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
say I got the money that I was supposed
 
04:33:01.670 --> 04:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
to get but I don't like the method by
 
04:33:04.551 --> 04:33:04.561 align:start position:0%
which I was paid I think they gave me
 
04:33:07.269 --> 04:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
too much in this check and not enough
 
04:33:10.029 --> 04:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to come in and ask you to
 
04:33:12.470 --> 04:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
adjudicate that so in terms of the
 
04:33:14.189 --> 04:33:14.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement of this
 
04:33:17.109 --> 04:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
law it's only going to kick in when
 
04:33:19.910 --> 04:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in and
 
04:33:23.750 --> 04:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
says this person did it wrong and and
 
04:33:26.189 --> 04:33:26.199 align:start position:0%
this is what I this is why I think they
 
04:33:28.551 --> 04:33:28.561 align:start position:0%
did it wrong and I want you to resolve
 
04:33:28.561 --> 04:33:30.349 align:start position:0%
did it wrong and I want you to resolve
it

04:33:30.349 --> 04:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:33:33.910 --> 04:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
so I think that I think I'm answering
 
04:33:37.150 --> 04:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
your question is you know who who
 
04:33:39.750 --> 04:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
watches this stuff and the answer is
 
04:33:41.709 --> 04:33:41.719 align:start position:0%
nobody unless
 
04:33:46.150 --> 04:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
somebody complains that it was there's a
 
04:33:48.269 --> 04:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
problem and that's why you don't have
 
04:33:51.029 --> 04:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
the experience on this because are
 
04:33:53.629 --> 04:33:53.639 align:start position:0%
people using this are they not who knows
 
04:33:58.070 --> 04:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
nobody complains about the process is is
 
04:34:00.949 --> 04:34:00.959 align:start position:0%
most mostly what you know well if you
 
04:34:02.869 --> 04:34:02.879 align:start position:0%
have someone where kid doesn't like Mom
 
04:34:04.551 --> 04:34:04.561 align:start position:0%
and mom doesn't like the kid and someone
 
04:34:06.109 --> 04:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
passed away and someone makes a beef to
 
04:34:08.029 --> 04:34:08.039 align:start position:0%
the complaint that they never should
 
04:34:10.150 --> 04:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
have passed that money over because I
 
04:34:13.510 --> 04:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
would I was entitled to it versus them
 
04:34:16.470 --> 04:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
or some debtor is trying to say that and
 
04:34:18.590 --> 04:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
if if one of the goofy things about
 
04:34:22.390 --> 04:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
probate that stinks is if you pay money
 
04:34:26.029 --> 04:34:26.039 align:start position:0%
out and they're not in
 
04:34:29.349 --> 04:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
priority you have to sometimes executive
 
04:34:30.830 --> 04:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
has to pay the money back so the money
 
04:34:32.470 --> 04:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
goes to the right priority I just think
 
04:34:35.670 --> 04:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
this provides an out it kind of gets a
 
04:34:37.670 --> 04:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
rid of all that priority and everything
 
04:34:40.349 --> 04:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
else priority is death

04:34:54.869 --> 04:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
debtors I I get all this useless stuff
 
04:34:56.629 --> 04:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
that I really wish I didn't know I want
 
04:34:59.109 --> 04:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
to unlearn some of the stuff I yes but
 
04:35:02.551 --> 04:35:02.561 align:start position:0%
however if you're in indul I if you're
 
04:35:04.949 --> 04:35:04.959 align:start position:0%
in there for an unrelated matter and you
 
04:35:07.109 --> 04:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
come across this that an employee was
 
04:35:09.869 --> 04:35:09.879 align:start position:0%
not paid on
 
04:35:13.789 --> 04:35:13.799 align:start position:0%
time would this allow the employer some
 
04:35:16.109 --> 04:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
protection to not get a fine from not
 
04:35:18.349 --> 04:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
paying this employee on time because
 
04:35:21.269 --> 04:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
hece or is this or am I look or should I
 
04:35:22.709 --> 04:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
be looking somewhere else for that
 
04:35:25.230 --> 04:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
exception for coverage for the employer
 
04:35:27.150 --> 04:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
to say you know we found out he was
 
04:35:28.830 --> 04:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
deceased before payroll went out we
 
04:35:30.150 --> 04:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
don't know where it is it's sitting in
 
04:35:32.230 --> 04:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
this account we want to pay them and you
 
04:35:33.590 --> 04:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
come in and say well you didn't pay this
 
04:35:35.869 --> 04:35:35.879 align:start position:0%
employee on time because you don't have
 
04:35:39.429 --> 04:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
the right paperwork yet where where is
 
04:35:41.349 --> 04:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
the department on that to say well we're
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
going to find you because you didn't pay
 
04:35:45.349 --> 04:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
this employee on time according to 275
 
04:35:47.910 --> 04:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
boom boom boom but over here it says you
 
04:35:50.869 --> 04:35:50.879 align:start position:0%
may pay a separate amount to a
 
04:35:53.390 --> 04:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
descendant upon proper notice you're
 
04:35:55.070 --> 04:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
waiting for that proper
 
04:35:56.990 --> 04:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
notice you know where I'm going with
 
04:35:59.590 --> 04:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
this I I think I do and so again forgive
 
04:36:01.269 --> 04:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
me if I misunderstood and jump in and
 
04:36:03.029 --> 04:36:03.039 align:start position:0%
and clarify for me if I haven't
 
04:36:05.390 --> 04:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
understood it you're talking about a
 
04:36:06.709 --> 04:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
where the Department's already out
 
04:36:08.789 --> 04:36:08.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps performing an inspection and it
 
04:36:10.830 --> 04:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
looks like employee a has not been paid
 
04:36:12.349 --> 04:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
on time so the question comes up what
 
04:36:14.230 --> 04:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
happened with employee a right and the
 
04:36:16.230 --> 04:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
employer comes back and and explains to
 
04:36:18.390 --> 04:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
the department employee a passed we're
 
04:36:21.709 --> 04:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
not sure how to pay them um again I
 
04:36:23.670 --> 04:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
think you know inspections themselves
 
04:36:27.310 --> 04:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
are also very fact dependent um the
 
04:36:29.150 --> 04:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
section in
 
04:36:32.109 --> 04:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
47 one gives the authorization to the
 
04:36:33.990 --> 04:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
employer to make that payment but there
 
04:36:38.551 --> 04:36:38.561 align:start position:0%
has to be the demand for it um again
 
04:36:40.590 --> 04:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
we've never gone out as far as I am
 
04:36:43.429 --> 04:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
aware of and cited this as a violation
 
04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
or found a violation that stemmed from
 
04:36:50.551 --> 04:36:50.561 align:start position:0%
this Arena um if if the department
 
04:36:53.230 --> 04:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
interacted with the
 
04:36:55.551 --> 04:36:55.561 align:start position:0%
employer and there hadn't yet been a
 
04:36:57.510 --> 04:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
demand I'd have to look at how that
 
04:36:59.510 --> 04:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
could potentially uh play out I mean
 
04:37:02.230 --> 04:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
it's it it could be
 
04:37:04.269 --> 04:37:04.279 align:start position:0%
construed there could be a potential
 
04:37:07.189 --> 04:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
violation for not making payment on
 
04:37:10.029 --> 04:37:10.039 align:start position:0%
time um because that is the requirement
 
04:37:12.310 --> 04:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
in the other side 275 I'm not going to
 
04:37:13.750 --> 04:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
remember the provision off the top of my
 
04:37:15.189 --> 04:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
head you know that you've got to make
 
04:37:17.590 --> 04:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
payment on the within within the
 
04:37:19.789 --> 04:37:19.799 align:start position:0%
specified parameters as set forth by
 
04:37:22.510 --> 04:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
Statute uh if there's a decedent who can
 
04:37:24.510 --> 04:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
be paid and there's been a demand for
 
04:37:27.349 --> 04:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
that payment again there's a May in
 
04:37:29.349 --> 04:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
there and I think it kind of depends on
 
04:37:31.470 --> 04:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
the scenarios about why you know what
 
04:37:34.310 --> 04:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
happened with with the the May and also
 
04:37:36.551 --> 04:37:36.561 align:start position:0%
if the employer is making efforts to try
 
04:37:36.561 --> 04:37:37.789 align:start position:0%
if the employer is making efforts to try
to

04:37:37.789 --> 04:37:37.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:37:41.830 --> 04:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
pay the deceased person but probate or
 
04:37:43.551 --> 04:37:43.561 align:start position:0%
something else has frozen the account or
 
04:37:45.070 --> 04:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
made it there's some other law that's
 
04:37:46.310 --> 04:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
interacting with that or there's
 
04:37:47.910 --> 04:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
something that's happening where okay we
 
04:37:49.670 --> 04:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
we're we we're holding it because
 
04:37:51.670 --> 04:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
there's an operation or a mechanism
 
04:37:53.789 --> 04:37:53.799 align:start position:0%
that's preventing us from paying I me
 
04:37:55.070 --> 04:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
that's something the department has to
 
04:37:56.670 --> 04:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
look at in determining whether or not
 
04:37:59.470 --> 04:37:59.480 align:start position:0%
the violation occurred um or whether or
 
04:38:01.789 --> 04:38:01.799 align:start position:0%
not it rises to the level of a violation
 
04:38:03.551 --> 04:38:03.561 align:start position:0%
but if I'm stripping it down sort of
 
04:38:05.670 --> 04:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
very very simplistically very black and
 
04:38:06.709 --> 04:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
white and I don't think it is
 
04:38:09.029 --> 04:38:09.039 align:start position:0%
necessarily that black and white could
 
04:38:11.709 --> 04:38:11.719 align:start position:0%
it possibly rise to the vi violation it
 
04:38:14.230 --> 04:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
potentially could um would that happen
 
04:38:15.551 --> 04:38:15.561 align:start position:0%
in every
 
04:38:18.470 --> 04:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
scenario I it would depend I I don't I
 
04:38:20.429 --> 04:38:20.439 align:start position:0%
don't know that I could say yes or no I
 
04:38:22.470 --> 04:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
think it would really depend on what
 
04:38:23.670 --> 04:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
what's occurred and what was sort of
 
04:38:25.150 --> 04:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
born out in the course of interacting
 
04:38:26.990 --> 04:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
with the employer in the course of that
 
04:38:31.510 --> 04:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:35.789 --> 04:38:35.799 align:start position:0%
you so I I think we've discussed
 
04:38:40.789 --> 04:38:40.799 align:start position:0%
this very well this afternoon and um
 
04:38:43.349 --> 04:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
unless somebody has another aspect of
 
04:38:46.230 --> 04:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
this that they want addressed I would
 
04:38:49.029 --> 04:38:49.039 align:start position:0%
say our job now is to make the
 
04:38:51.230 --> 04:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the committee a
 
04:38:51.240 --> 04:38:52.510 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the committee a
recommended

04:38:52.510 --> 04:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
04:38:52.520 --> 04:38:54.310 align:start position:0%
recommended
motion

04:38:54.310 --> 04:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:38:57.910 --> 04:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
um with with a couple caveats the
 
04:39:00.910 --> 04:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
department did say that they would um uh
 
04:39:03.349 --> 04:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
take a closer look at the language um
 
04:39:06.429 --> 04:39:06.439 align:start position:0%
immediately following the 300 $3,000 and
 
04:39:10.990 --> 04:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
would just verify that um uh RSA 561 is
 
04:39:13.150 --> 04:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
exactly what we think it
 
04:39:16.310 --> 04:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
is so um I believe that uh
 
04:39:18.390 --> 04:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth was actually
 
04:39:20.789 --> 04:39:20.799 align:start position:0%
reading from his laptop
 
04:39:26.109 --> 04:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
5611 read off what the order of um yeah
 
04:39:29.029 --> 04:39:29.039 align:start position:0%
of test toy this actually the language
 
04:39:30.551 --> 04:39:30.561 align:start position:0%
that you're Crossing out I would
 
04:39:33.590 --> 04:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
question whether descendant is
 
04:39:36.150 --> 04:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate if we're looking looking at
 
04:39:39.670 --> 04:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
the orders of um an order from a probate
 
04:39:43.910 --> 04:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
court it would go to as it says on 5611
 
04:39:45.470 --> 04:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
from my recollection of what you read
 
04:39:47.430 --> 04:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
off spouse
 
04:39:52.310 --> 04:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
first child or issue second up to parent
 
04:39:52.320 --> 04:39:53.708 align:start position:0%
first child or issue second up to parent
after

04:39:53.708 --> 04:39:53.718 align:start position:0%
after
 
04:39:56.990 --> 04:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
that um and I'm not going any further
 
04:39:59.310 --> 04:39:59.320 align:start position:0%
with that part I wouldn't even I'd be
 
04:40:01.350 --> 04:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
hesitant to go that far because of the
 
04:40:04.110 --> 04:40:04.120 align:start position:0%
way it's written it so the spouse that's
 
04:40:07.230 --> 04:40:07.240 align:start position:0%
easy there's a spouse go spouse is in a
 
04:40:09.070 --> 04:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
then it starts to go to what if there
 
04:40:11.390 --> 04:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
aren't these other things and you've got
 
04:40:14.550 --> 04:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
to read quite a bit so let's say it's a
 
04:40:14.560 --> 04:40:16.590 align:start position:0%
to read quite a bit so let's say it's a
child

04:40:16.590 --> 04:40:16.600 align:start position:0%
child
 
04:40:19.670 --> 04:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
um onea doesn't tell you to pay that
 
04:40:21.110 --> 04:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
child it tells you what to do if there
 
04:40:23.750 --> 04:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
is no child and so somewhere down there
 
04:40:25.910 --> 04:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
I've got to read down to well is it the
 
04:40:27.990 --> 04:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
only child or is it one of multiple
 
04:40:28.000 --> 04:40:29.750 align:start position:0%
only child or is it one of multiple
children

04:40:29.750 --> 04:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:40:32.948 --> 04:40:32.958 align:start position:0%
so from that standpoint for me it's very
 
04:40:35.590 --> 04:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
complicated if it's not spouse
 
04:40:38.430 --> 04:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
and I would I
 
04:40:42.750 --> 04:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
think I understand why OS struck
 
04:40:47.430 --> 04:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
him um and I think OS was trying to come
 
04:40:53.110 --> 04:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
up with a a neutral way of of putting
 
04:40:57.350 --> 04:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
that but you're correct the deant is not
 
04:40:59.990 --> 04:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily the person who's going to be
 
04:41:03.310 --> 04:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
specified at the bottom um deant may
 
04:41:05.948 --> 04:41:05.958 align:start position:0%
have some legal
 
04:41:10.230 --> 04:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
meaning to it that does not correspond
 
04:41:13.190 --> 04:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
with when I start going down through
 
04:41:16.670 --> 04:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
5611 whom I find is the is the
 
04:41:20.830 --> 04:41:20.840 align:start position:0%
designated person uh thing
 
04:41:24.350 --> 04:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
to to replace deant which may be a
 
04:41:26.190 --> 04:41:26.200 align:start position:0%
legally loaded term with a
 
04:41:26.200 --> 04:41:27.310 align:start position:0%
legally loaded term with a
[Music]

04:41:27.310 --> 04:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:41:31.430 --> 04:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
non so just to be clear um what I'm
 
04:41:33.628 --> 04:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
looking at is the word
 
04:41:33.638 --> 04:41:35.670 align:start position:0%
looking at is the word
descendant

04:41:35.670 --> 04:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
descendant
 
04:41:35.680 --> 04:41:37.270 align:start position:0%
descendant
so

04:41:37.270 --> 04:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:41:39.868 --> 04:41:39.878 align:start position:0%
this it's crossed off it's your
 
04:41:41.750 --> 04:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
intention was to cross it off as part of
 
04:41:45.150 --> 04:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
this bill um so that's where I'm saying
 
04:41:47.868 --> 04:41:47.878 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure that based upon what
 
04:41:49.310 --> 04:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
you read in
 
04:41:52.230 --> 04:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
5611 if descendant is even appropriate
 
04:41:52.240 --> 04:41:53.750 align:start position:0%
5611 if descendant is even appropriate
in

04:41:53.750 --> 04:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:41:56.270 --> 04:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
2023 because it's basically saying that
 
04:41:57.750 --> 04:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
the distribution if you were to leave
 
04:42:01.628 --> 04:42:01.638 align:start position:0%
that language as is and not cross it
 
04:42:05.910 --> 04:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
off is there possibly a concern with a
 
04:42:08.350 --> 04:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
conflict with 5611 where actually the
 
04:42:11.310 --> 04:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
first person to be paid if they exist is
 
04:42:15.910 --> 04:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:18.708 --> 04:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
descendant my point is is maybe 50 years
 
04:42:21.470 --> 04:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
ago okay I see what okay now I get it
 
04:42:24.070 --> 04:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
that this may have been intended to
 
04:42:28.110 --> 04:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
override 561 co11 which by the way may
 
04:42:29.390 --> 04:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
not have
 
04:42:32.230 --> 04:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
existed I'm I'm going at
 
04:42:35.150 --> 04:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
71 oh no there was 190 three there was
 
04:42:37.270 --> 04:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
something so there was something there
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
but that that's I had never thought
 
04:42:44.350 --> 04:42:44.360 align:start position:0%
about that was this intended to
 
04:42:47.628 --> 04:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
override the law and not allow the
 
04:42:51.190 --> 04:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
spouse to collect the money um if it was
 
04:42:56.190 --> 04:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
a a child who came in and gosh I hope
 
04:42:59.948 --> 04:42:59.958 align:start position:0%
not but you're right the word
 
04:43:03.990 --> 04:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
descendant if you take it literally a
 
04:43:06.150 --> 04:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
spouse or a
 
04:43:12.150 --> 04:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
parent who might have precedence over a
 
04:43:14.910 --> 04:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
child might not be a descendant under
 
04:43:17.708 --> 04:43:17.718 align:start position:0%
the old language um to be honest if
 
04:43:21.150 --> 04:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
that's true then that's another argument
 
04:43:21.160 --> 04:43:22.190 align:start position:0%
that's true then that's another argument
for

04:43:22.190 --> 04:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:43:24.788 --> 04:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
striking the existing language and
 
04:43:28.270 --> 04:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
replacing it with a reference to the law
 
04:43:31.430 --> 04:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
as written and as may be amended in the
 
04:43:36.510 --> 04:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
future um because yeah if that's true I
 
04:43:38.350 --> 04:43:38.360 align:start position:0%
don't like it at all that it's will
 
04:43:39.990 --> 04:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
follow state law
 
04:43:44.150 --> 04:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
unless um really makes me uncomfortable
 
04:43:46.470 --> 04:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
and then as it relates to the other uh
 
04:43:47.910 --> 04:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
portion that the department was going to
 
04:43:50.510 --> 04:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
follow up on specifically if there's
 
04:43:53.390 --> 04:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
notice of a the pendency of the probate
 
04:43:55.750 --> 04:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
proceedings is it the all or the all or
 
04:43:57.948 --> 04:43:57.958 align:start position:0%
the nothing is by end of day tomorrow an
 
04:44:01.390 --> 04:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
okay time frame that is is more than uh
 
04:44:04.990 --> 04:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
uh rapid enough um what I would propose
 
04:44:09.230 --> 04:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
to the committee is that we do um make
 
04:44:12.430 --> 04:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
sure that any requests of the department
 
04:44:16.030 --> 04:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
are are on the table before we leave I
 
04:44:16.040 --> 04:44:18.350 align:start position:0%
are are on the table before we leave I
am

04:44:18.350 --> 04:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
am
 
04:44:20.230 --> 04:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
comfortable finalizing our
 
04:44:22.550 --> 04:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation in either case we want to
 
04:44:24.390 --> 04:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
know those answers before we vote as a
 
04:44:26.550 --> 04:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
committee but I it wouldn't change my
 
04:44:29.470 --> 04:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
opinion as a member of the subcommittee
 
04:44:36.030 --> 04:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
if you say yes or no or so um
 
04:44:40.628 --> 04:44:40.638 align:start position:0%
tomorrow or or or this week
 
04:44:44.868 --> 04:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
um is plenty we can have it for tomorrow
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
so I think that'll be a quick one for us
 
04:44:48.310 --> 04:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
to follow up
 
04:44:52.350 --> 04:44:52.360 align:start position:0%
on different that we're talking about
 
04:44:54.830 --> 04:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
561 if that's stay if that's staying in
 
04:44:56.350 --> 04:44:56.360 align:start position:0%
there and and the employer makes a
 
04:44:57.430 --> 04:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
mistake in
 
04:44:59.910 --> 04:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
paying follows that and says okay well
 
04:45:03.070 --> 04:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
you're the spouse you're giving me this
 
04:45:05.910 --> 04:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
paperwork yes goes to probate and the
 
04:45:08.270 --> 04:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
spouse is only getting $1 out of the
 
04:45:11.070 --> 04:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
will would the employer be on the hook
 
04:45:14.750 --> 04:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
for paying out of order according to 561
 
04:45:16.470 --> 04:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
would they now be let's say there's a
 
04:45:18.750 --> 04:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
child would they now be have to pay the
 
04:45:20.868 --> 04:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
child that wages due because they
 
04:45:24.708 --> 04:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
misapplied that payment to a to a spouse
 
04:45:27.830 --> 04:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
according to 561 by having this language
 
04:45:29.510 --> 04:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
in here that talks about whether or not
 
04:45:31.150 --> 04:45:31.160 align:start position:0%
there's any type of probate order and
 
04:45:32.510 --> 04:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to repeat the ones that
 
04:45:34.510 --> 04:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
tongue tias if there's any type type of
 
04:45:36.270 --> 04:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
a probate order by having that in here
 
04:45:38.350 --> 04:45:38.360 align:start position:0%
if there's no probate order at the time
 
04:45:40.830 --> 04:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
of the distribution of those due
 
04:45:46.070 --> 04:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
wages then if the employer follows 5611
 
04:45:48.150 --> 04:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
and the spouse is present there's no
 
04:45:51.190 --> 04:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
divorce they're still married um and
 
04:45:53.110 --> 04:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
gives it to her and in the end she's
 
04:45:55.670 --> 04:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
only entitled to $1 that's something
 
04:45:57.190 --> 04:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
that's going to have to be addressed in
 
04:45:59.590 --> 04:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
the Probate Court after that as far as
 
04:46:01.390 --> 04:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
fixing it with the inventory and the
 
04:46:03.350 --> 04:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
accountings that wouldn't be back to the
 
04:46:04.948 --> 04:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
employer saying pay the wrong person and
 
04:46:08.070 --> 04:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:12.390 --> 04:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
again right just making just reading
 
04:46:18.708 --> 04:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:21.628 --> 04:46:21.638 align:start position:0%
brain to prot what happens if they give
 
04:46:23.590 --> 04:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
this to someone complain I think allows
 
04:46:25.190 --> 04:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
them to do
 
04:46:27.470 --> 04:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
that they follow the
 
04:46:31.190 --> 04:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:35.070 --> 04:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
requested and then it's up to State not
 
04:46:39.270 --> 04:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:43.788 --> 04:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
deal again I said's
 
04:46:47.190 --> 04:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
world most of the money from that $3,000
 
04:46:49.708 --> 04:46:49.718 align:start position:0%
is go
 
04:46:49.718 --> 04:46:51.830 align:start position:0%
is go
toal

04:46:51.830 --> 04:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
toal
 
04:46:55.750 --> 04:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
primary second primary is taxes lawyer
 
04:46:58.270 --> 04:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
fees which is going to do expense or
 
04:47:01.628 --> 04:47:01.638 align:start position:0%
taxes and and I just don't see that you
 
04:47:05.628 --> 04:47:05.638 align:start position:0%
can't bury someone even appre for $2500
 
04:47:09.548 --> 04:47:09.558 align:start position:0%
today so bury them out in the
 
04:47:11.830 --> 04:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
back0 with the family grave site it's
 
04:47:13.548 --> 04:47:13.558 align:start position:0%
still going to cost you some money so I
 
04:47:16.548 --> 04:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
just don't see it this from a probate
 
04:47:18.910 --> 04:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
standpoint using the priority of who
 
04:47:20.230 --> 04:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
gets money
 
04:47:20.240 --> 04:47:21.868 align:start position:0%
gets money
that

04:47:21.868 --> 04:47:21.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:47:25.990 --> 04:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:26.000 --> 04:47:29.390 align:start position:0%
 
50,000

04:47:29.390 --> 04:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:37.868 --> 04:47:37.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:42.390 --> 04:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
and I I agree too that the way this is
 
04:47:42.400 --> 04:47:46.390 align:start position:0%
and I I agree too that the way this is
worded

04:47:46.390 --> 04:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:50.070 --> 04:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
um that it that it it will resolve that
 
04:47:51.590 --> 04:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
issue not
 
04:47:51.600 --> 04:47:59.750 align:start position:0%
issue not
complicated

04:47:59.750 --> 04:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:02.548 --> 04:48:02.558 align:start position:0%
um that's how I read that's how we read
 
04:48:06.230 --> 04:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:09.670 --> 04:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
and and I guess that's again somebody
 
04:48:12.110 --> 04:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:15.150 --> 04:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
in so somebody could come in for a
 
04:48:19.548 --> 04:48:19.558 align:start position:0%
hearing right I I could say I'm the my
 
04:48:22.788 --> 04:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
spouse I so I go in and I say could you
 
04:48:26.150 --> 04:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
give me the three grand Yos and the
 
04:48:29.670 --> 04:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
employer says no because I don't want to
 
04:48:31.350 --> 04:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
I could go to the Department of Labor
 
04:48:32.868 --> 04:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
and say I think they should have given
 
04:48:35.430 --> 04:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
it to me and I think the reason they
 
04:48:38.230 --> 04:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
didn't is because they don't have enough
 
04:48:39.948 --> 04:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
money in their payroll account and
 
04:48:41.590 --> 04:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
they're trying to cover for the fact
 
04:48:44.350 --> 04:48:44.360 align:start position:0%
that they can't make wages and you would
 
04:48:45.868 --> 04:48:45.878 align:start position:0%
hear you would hear that and you'd hear
 
04:48:48.390 --> 04:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
the employer side of it and who knows
 
04:48:50.670 --> 04:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
what you'd decide it would depend on all
 
04:48:54.590 --> 04:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
the facts of that case
 
04:48:58.628 --> 04:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
so to say can you assure us that when
 
04:49:01.310 --> 04:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
this happens it will never go to a
 
04:49:04.030 --> 04:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
hearing because the law covers it the
 
04:49:07.110 --> 04:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
answer is no you can't give us those
 
04:49:11.390 --> 04:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
assurances but we can imagine
 
04:49:11.400 --> 04:49:13.270 align:start position:0%
assurances but we can imagine
reasonable

04:49:13.270 --> 04:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
04:49:15.910 --> 04:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
outcomes um that would never get to the
 
04:49:18.628 --> 04:49:18.638 align:start position:0%
hearing or would be quickly resolved in
 
04:49:21.150 --> 04:49:21.160 align:start position:0%
a preliminary hearing or or that sort of
 
04:49:24.190 --> 04:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
thing so how do we get this there so we
 
04:49:25.990 --> 04:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
don't have that so that we don't have
 
04:49:28.110 --> 04:49:28.120 align:start position:0%
that so that it's not going to hearing
 
04:49:29.788 --> 04:49:29.798 align:start position:0%
or no dispute could ever be brought up
 
04:49:29.798 --> 04:49:30.990 align:start position:0%
or no dispute could ever be brought up
about

04:49:30.990 --> 04:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:49:32.910 --> 04:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
it there's obviously going to be
 
04:49:35.230 --> 04:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
outliers people that withhold it just to
 
04:49:37.390 --> 04:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
hide behind this blah blah blah but for
 
04:49:39.590 --> 04:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
a regular employer to not have to incur
 
04:49:41.868 --> 04:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
a $1,500 lawyer bill because they don't
 
04:49:43.510 --> 04:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
know what to do with
 
04:49:47.190 --> 04:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
this which is cheap these
 
04:49:49.470 --> 04:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
days that that's a fair question I think
 
04:49:50.868 --> 04:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
that would require some additional
 
04:49:52.070 --> 04:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
thought I don't know that that's one
 
04:49:55.150 --> 04:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
that I'm able to answer um or spin or or
 
04:49:57.868 --> 04:49:57.878 align:start position:0%
provide language for um off you know in
 
04:49:59.590 --> 04:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
the immediate would that be part of what
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
you're asking for Mr
 
04:50:06.310 --> 04:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
um think that's a
 
04:50:08.830 --> 04:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
and other people can weigh in it's not
 
04:50:12.110 --> 04:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
just me that seems like a lot of ask to
 
04:50:14.830 --> 04:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
say you know how do we change the law to
 
04:50:16.948 --> 04:50:16.958 align:start position:0%
make sure that the department always
 
04:50:20.150 --> 04:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
denies request for hearings is that I
 
04:50:22.110 --> 04:50:22.120 align:start position:0%
don't think that exists anywhere you
 
04:50:24.430 --> 04:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
always will
 
04:50:27.430 --> 04:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
entertain a request to say I think
 
04:50:31.310 --> 04:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
there's a problem um I I don't think we
 
04:50:34.628 --> 04:50:34.638 align:start position:0%
can legislate that Pro it it's the
 
04:50:37.708 --> 04:50:37.718 align:start position:0%
essence of how you adjudicate things and
 
04:50:39.670 --> 04:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
I don't think we can legislate that away
 
04:50:41.510 --> 04:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
well it's it's like saying um how can
 
04:50:43.510 --> 04:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
you stop people from suing each other
 
04:50:45.510 --> 04:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
you can't no not I'm not saying that I'm
 
04:50:47.030 --> 04:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
just saying so a regular person a
 
04:50:48.430 --> 04:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
regular employer doesn't have to call
 
04:50:51.150 --> 04:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
his attorney rack up a bill trying to
 
04:50:53.230 --> 04:50:53.240 align:start position:0%
figure out who to pet that there at
 
04:50:55.070 --> 04:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
least it's clear that so the department
 
04:50:56.350 --> 04:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
can if they call the department the
 
04:50:57.868 --> 04:50:57.878 align:start position:0%
department can give them at least some
 
04:51:00.070 --> 04:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
guidance saying you you just do this
 
04:51:02.430 --> 04:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
this and this having to rack up a legal
 
04:51:03.948 --> 04:51:03.958 align:start position:0%
bill trying to figure out somebody's I
 
04:51:05.948 --> 04:51:05.958 align:start position:0%
would suggest that Brian seaworth could
 
04:51:08.110 --> 04:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
figure it
 
04:51:10.190 --> 04:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
out and
 
04:51:12.190 --> 04:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
and so I think I understand
 
04:51:14.628 --> 04:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
representative avalani question so you
 
04:51:17.750 --> 04:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
know if the question is what language
 
04:51:19.470 --> 04:51:19.480 align:start position:0%
can be put into the statute so that a
 
04:51:21.670 --> 04:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
hearing cannot possibly happen one I
 
04:51:23.030 --> 04:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
would have to give some thought to that
 
04:51:24.190 --> 04:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
but it is a fair point that
 
04:51:27.948 --> 04:51:27.958 align:start position:0%
representative sewor raises if there is
 
04:51:31.510 --> 04:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
a statutory provision that is affording
 
04:51:34.030 --> 04:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
an option or a right or protection ction
 
04:51:35.590 --> 04:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
or something of that nature and someone
 
04:51:37.430 --> 04:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
is alleging through the adjudicative
 
04:51:40.470 --> 04:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
form I I think this wasn't complied with
 
04:51:42.548 --> 04:51:42.558 align:start position:0%
and there's a recourse for me and I I
 
04:51:43.868 --> 04:51:43.878 align:start position:0%
want to have a full and fair
 
04:51:45.910 --> 04:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
administrative hearing uh on that
 
04:51:49.470 --> 04:51:49.480 align:start position:0%
recourse and be heard on it absent and
 
04:51:51.510 --> 04:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
again there are you know preliminary we
 
04:51:53.270 --> 04:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
call them motions but it doesn't have to
 
04:51:55.230 --> 04:51:55.240 align:start position:0%
be drafted by an attorney honestly a lot
 
04:51:56.868 --> 04:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
of wage claims are handled by both
 
04:51:59.070 --> 04:51:59.080 align:start position:0%
employers and employees on a pray basis
 
04:52:01.150 --> 04:52:01.160 align:start position:0%
meaning they're not represented um it
 
04:52:02.910 --> 04:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
can be done via email it can be done in
 
04:52:06.310 --> 04:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
letter uh something in writing the step
 
04:52:08.470 --> 04:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
one threshold really is did you assert
 
04:52:10.590 --> 04:52:10.600 align:start position:0%
enough for us to say we have the ability
 
04:52:12.750 --> 04:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
to look at it and you're articulating
 
04:52:15.548 --> 04:52:15.558 align:start position:0%
enough uh of a of a articulable dispute
 
04:52:17.868 --> 04:52:17.878 align:start position:0%
under the area you're pointing to for us
 
04:52:19.430 --> 04:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
to get it scheduled because if you come
 
04:52:21.910 --> 04:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
to the department and you're saying and
 
04:52:23.788 --> 04:52:23.798 align:start position:0%
I'm going to use a very extreme example
 
04:52:25.548 --> 04:52:25.558 align:start position:0%
I'm upset about disability
 
04:52:26.830 --> 04:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination well we don't have
 
04:52:28.470 --> 04:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over that we can't schedule
 
04:52:30.590 --> 04:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
that for you uh if you're asserting I
 
04:52:32.868 --> 04:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
think there was a violation of the of
 
04:52:35.270 --> 04:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
275 48 there were illegal deductions I
 
04:52:37.110 --> 04:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
think I'm owed money that's enough to
 
04:52:39.590 --> 04:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
say okay you've asserted a colorable
 
04:52:40.868 --> 04:52:40.878 align:start position:0%
dispute that the department has the
 
04:52:43.110 --> 04:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
authority to resolve the employer can
 
04:52:44.830 --> 04:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
come back and we would call it
 
04:52:46.628 --> 04:52:46.638 align:start position:0%
technically a motion to dismiss but
 
04:52:48.628 --> 04:52:48.638 align:start position:0%
might say no that's not true attached
 
04:52:50.670 --> 04:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
fine payroll records they've been paid
 
04:52:52.750 --> 04:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
everything was on the up and up um
 
04:52:54.150 --> 04:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
here's the signed authorization that
 
04:52:55.628 --> 04:52:55.638 align:start position:0%
they said we could do these deductions
 
04:52:57.910 --> 04:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be um that can be looked
 
04:52:59.868 --> 04:52:59.878 align:start position:0%
at for okay is this really rising to the
 
04:53:01.350 --> 04:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
level of dispute that needs to be
 
04:53:03.628 --> 04:53:03.638 align:start position:0%
scheduled and it may be dispositioned B
 
04:53:05.190 --> 04:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
based on that preliminary those
 
04:53:07.510 --> 04:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
preliminary pleadings it may go to a
 
04:53:08.750 --> 04:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
hearing and the employer gets the
 
04:53:10.270 --> 04:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to fully flesh out the
 
04:53:11.910 --> 04:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
argument that they're making and they
 
04:53:13.628 --> 04:53:13.638 align:start position:0%
get a decision for that so I think it is
 
04:53:14.910 --> 04:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
very difficult to say we're going to
 
04:53:16.590 --> 04:53:16.600 align:start position:0%
craft language that just bars you from
 
04:53:19.510 --> 04:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
having a hearing over an articulated
 
04:53:21.948 --> 04:53:21.958 align:start position:0%
dispute uh under the under the statute
 
04:53:23.788 --> 04:53:23.798 align:start position:0%
if the question is is there language
 
04:53:25.788 --> 04:53:25.798 align:start position:0%
that can be encompassed within this
 
04:53:27.230 --> 04:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
amendment to make it easier for
 
04:53:29.750 --> 04:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
employers to navigate such that when
 
04:53:31.788 --> 04:53:31.798 align:start position:0%
these scenarios arise they're not having
 
04:53:34.990 --> 04:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
to sort through by 5611 and I think
 
04:53:36.548 --> 04:53:36.558 align:start position:0%
that's a you know think that's a fair
 
04:53:38.910 --> 04:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
question to ask we can certainly take a
 
04:53:40.868 --> 04:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
look at I think that would take a little
 
04:53:42.670 --> 04:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
bit of thought in research you you would
 
04:53:45.510 --> 04:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
want to make certain that any language
 
04:53:47.470 --> 04:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
that was put forward is not going to
 
04:53:49.510 --> 04:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
interfere or run a foul of the
 
04:53:51.990 --> 04:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
requirements that are set forth in
 
04:53:54.510 --> 04:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
561 period and I'm not an expert in that
 
04:53:56.310 --> 04:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
area so off the top of my head I I don't
 
04:53:57.548 --> 04:53:57.558 align:start position:0%
know that I would be able to say that's
 
04:53:59.310 --> 04:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
doable or not doable I think it would
 
04:54:02.270 --> 04:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
require some thought um and and a little
 
04:54:04.310 --> 04:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
bit of research but if part of the ask
 
04:54:05.750 --> 04:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
we can look at that but I don't think
 
04:54:07.548 --> 04:54:07.558 align:start position:0%
we'd have that one ready by
 
04:54:11.230 --> 04:54:11.240 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and and i' even
 
04:54:14.350 --> 04:54:14.360 align:start position:0%
caution assuming that we come up with
 
04:54:18.270 --> 04:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
something I'd be very nervous about that
 
04:54:20.670 --> 04:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
so next year
 
04:54:24.470 --> 04:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
5611 could be radically changed maybe
 
04:54:27.150 --> 04:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
spouses suddenly the legislators decide
 
04:54:29.190 --> 04:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
we don't like spouses anymore and they
 
04:54:34.270 --> 04:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
don't get any money um if we try to
 
04:54:35.788 --> 04:54:35.798 align:start position:0%
summarize or
 
04:54:39.350 --> 04:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
simplify the legal process that
 
04:54:42.110 --> 04:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
exists we risk getting it wrong in our
 
04:54:44.628 --> 04:54:44.638 align:start position:0%
summary and then we risk creating a
 
04:54:48.390 --> 04:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
conflict in law if if Chang other side
 
04:54:49.470 --> 04:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
right no and I think that's also
 
04:54:50.310 --> 04:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
something that would have to be
 
04:54:53.948 --> 04:54:53.958 align:start position:0%
considered in trying to put language
 
04:54:56.948 --> 04:54:56.958 align:start position:0%
together and if I could um one of the
 
04:54:58.510 --> 04:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
things I understand that representative
 
04:55:00.708 --> 04:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
Avalon's concerns are the cost for the
 
04:55:02.390 --> 04:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
employer and I think that that's an
 
04:55:05.830 --> 04:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
extremely reasonable a concern because a
 
04:55:08.030 --> 04:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
probate lawyer and state lawyer is not
 
04:55:11.548 --> 04:55:11.558 align:start position:0%
an inexpensive find um but there is a
 
04:55:13.548 --> 04:55:13.558 align:start position:0%
resource that is free and that's going
 
04:55:15.310 --> 04:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
to the actual probate court in the
 
04:55:17.670 --> 04:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
county in which the probate may take
 
04:55:20.830 --> 04:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
place the clerk's office may have some
 
04:55:24.230 --> 04:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
resources um they can certainly point
 
04:55:26.190 --> 04:55:26.200 align:start position:0%
you in the direction of somebody who
 
04:55:28.750 --> 04:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
maybe will work for a lower fee but
 
04:55:30.590 --> 04:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
there are options that they can do
 
04:55:31.708 --> 04:55:31.718 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of people that
 
04:55:33.548 --> 04:55:33.558 align:start position:0%
come before them that don't have the the
 
04:55:35.628 --> 04:55:35.638 align:start position:0%
money to hire an attorney but need to go
 
04:55:38.150 --> 04:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
through probate so they may have that as
 
04:55:40.390 --> 04:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
a resource and that's free for the
 
04:55:44.150 --> 04:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:47.628 --> 04:55:47.638 align:start position:0%
do at least make the phone
 
04:55:49.948 --> 04:55:49.958 align:start position:0%
call well well that's always good I know
 
04:55:52.548 --> 04:55:52.558 align:start position:0%
a lot of us have business attorneys on
 
04:55:54.788 --> 04:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
retainer for that for those types of
 
04:55:57.750 --> 04:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
questions or for in you know inquiries
 
04:56:01.030 --> 04:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
from do Dr or anything like that um
 
04:56:02.750 --> 04:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
there shouldn't be an additional cost to
 
04:56:04.788 --> 04:56:04.798 align:start position:0%
the employer to give somebody their last
 
04:56:06.510 --> 04:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
paycheck that's what I'm looking at
 
04:56:08.030 --> 04:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
they're already having the cost of
 
04:56:10.430 --> 04:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
providing that employee they you know
 
04:56:12.670 --> 04:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
having that employee there or take the
 
04:56:14.590 --> 04:56:14.600 align:start position:0%
cost for payroll services and then
 
04:56:16.230 --> 04:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
having to an additional cost to figure
 
04:56:18.670 --> 04:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
out who to pay if there is a demand
 
04:56:20.230 --> 04:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't fall to the employer there
 
04:56:21.628 --> 04:56:21.638 align:start position:0%
should be some type of protection in
 
04:56:24.110 --> 04:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
case they do make a wrong payment or
 
04:56:26.070 --> 04:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
there is a wrong turn somewhere that the
 
04:56:28.030 --> 04:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
do Department La is not going to come
 
04:56:29.190 --> 04:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
back and say well you paid the wrong
 
04:56:32.270 --> 04:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
person under this but I paid it under
 
04:56:34.548 --> 04:56:34.558 align:start position:0%
561 to make sure that there's no wage
 
04:56:36.548 --> 04:56:36.558 align:start position:0%
claim further down the road by the
 
04:56:38.430 --> 04:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
proper person that should have gotten
 
04:56:41.990 --> 04:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
that money and if I can
 
04:56:44.670 --> 04:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
add I think this is outside Department
 
04:56:48.030 --> 04:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
of Labor entirely so again it's back to
 
04:56:49.510 --> 04:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
when will was here I asked him you know
 
04:56:51.270 --> 04:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
what happens I'm about to approve
 
04:56:53.190 --> 04:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
payroll and someone comes running in and
 
04:56:57.150 --> 04:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
say whoa whoa whoa that that gym's
 
04:56:57.160 --> 04:56:58.788 align:start position:0%
say whoa whoa whoa that that gym's
dead

04:56:58.788 --> 04:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
dead
 
04:57:02.230 --> 04:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
um according to Will from the probate
 
04:57:04.548 --> 04:57:04.558 align:start position:0%
end I should not not approve I should
 
04:57:06.628 --> 04:57:06.638 align:start position:0%
take that check out I should hold the
 
04:57:09.430 --> 04:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
money and I should start this lengthy
 
04:57:12.430 --> 04:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
process of finding out what's going to
 
04:57:14.470 --> 04:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
happen to that estate and who I'm
 
04:57:16.708 --> 04:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
supposed to send the check
 
04:57:20.868 --> 04:57:20.878 align:start position:0%
to and that's not a Department of Labor
 
04:57:24.470 --> 04:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
issue and it is because where is it in
 
04:57:26.628 --> 04:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
law that we can stop we have to stop
 
04:57:28.868 --> 04:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
payment because not in Department of
 
04:57:30.670 --> 04:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
Labor Law
 
04:57:33.470 --> 04:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
275 and that's why we can't fix fix it
 
04:57:33.480 --> 04:57:34.310 align:start position:0%
275 and that's why we can't fix fix it
in

04:57:34.310 --> 04:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:57:37.708 --> 04:57:37.718 align:start position:0%
275 and and that's also and and we
 
04:57:41.270 --> 04:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
speculate on this that might be why this
 
04:57:43.510 --> 04:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
will said maybe that's part of how this
 
04:57:47.868 --> 04:57:47.878 align:start position:0%
came out is to deal with that issue of
 
04:57:51.510 --> 04:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
instead of tying up one
 
04:57:55.350 --> 04:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
paycheck less than $300 for months while
 
04:57:58.750 --> 04:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
you try engaging your lawyer this whole
 
04:58:00.548 --> 04:58:00.558 align:start position:0%
time well what am I supposed to do with
 
04:58:03.788 --> 04:58:03.798 align:start position:0%
this 300 you get this safety value well
 
04:58:06.990 --> 04:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
I can just turn it over to the the
 
04:58:13.070 --> 04:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
spouse because this allows me that out
 
04:58:18.070 --> 04:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
so again you know I won't I I won't turn
 
04:58:20.430 --> 04:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
away more information and learning more
 
04:58:24.548 --> 04:58:24.558 align:start position:0%
about this but it seems to me to ask to
 
04:58:27.868 --> 04:58:27.878 align:start position:0%
solve in labor law an issue
 
04:58:31.670 --> 04:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
that's really dominated
 
04:58:34.708 --> 04:58:34.718 align:start position:0%
by other areas of
 
04:58:39.390 --> 04:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
law is too much is too much to squeeze
 
04:58:44.750 --> 04:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
out of this section that's that's
 
04:58:48.670 --> 04:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
my since they didn't pay that
 
04:58:50.910 --> 04:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
employee and somebody came lied to them
 
04:58:53.230 --> 04:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
and said they were deceased we heard we
 
04:58:55.910 --> 04:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
may got a car accident he's in I he's
 
04:58:58.470 --> 04:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
half dead you shouldn't pay them and
 
04:59:01.628 --> 04:59:01.638 align:start position:0%
then they come back and now now they
 
04:59:03.708 --> 04:59:03.718 align:start position:0%
file a wage claim you didn't pay my last
 
04:59:05.990 --> 04:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
paycheck I was in the hospital follow
 
04:59:08.310 --> 04:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
doing there's a daily fine and then
 
04:59:09.430 --> 04:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
there's an interest fine and then
 
04:59:11.510 --> 04:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
there's a percentage fine I it could
 
04:59:15.310 --> 04:59:15.320 align:start position:0%
stack up to a
 
04:59:17.670 --> 04:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
large dollar amount for the employer for
 
04:59:20.510 --> 04:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
making that judgment I just want to make
 
04:59:23.110 --> 04:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
sure that the employers are
 
04:59:26.310 --> 04:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
protected Lena was a master of
 
04:59:28.270 --> 04:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
scenarios as an employee you have to
 
04:59:30.750 --> 04:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
look at everything keep in mind one
 
04:59:32.190 --> 04:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
thing and I think this has been said
 
04:59:33.788 --> 04:59:33.798 align:start position:0%
before I know that representative
 
04:59:35.110 --> 04:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
inventin has said it I know that
 
04:59:37.070 --> 04:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
representative kahill has has repeated
 
04:59:41.070 --> 04:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
it the Department of Labor does is is we
 
04:59:43.070 --> 04:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
like to educate we like to assist
 
04:59:45.708 --> 04:59:45.718 align:start position:0%
employers to remain in compliance we
 
04:59:48.070 --> 04:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
like to help employees when it's
 
04:59:51.390 --> 04:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
necessary we help carriers to remain in
 
04:59:54.190 --> 04:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
compliance that is that is what we would
 
04:59:56.590 --> 04:59:56.600 align:start position:0%
prefer to do and part of the reason why
 
04:59:58.910 --> 04:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
civil penalties come into play in any of
 
05:00:02.310 --> 05:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
these is because it didn't work and so
 
05:00:04.070 --> 05:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's just another another step in how
 
05:00:06.430 --> 05:00:06.440 align:start position:0%
to help that employer remember for next
 
05:00:09.110 --> 05:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
time to be in compliance or that carrier
 
05:00:11.430 --> 05:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
Etc and in the context of the
 
05:00:12.708 --> 05:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
percentages I think what you were
 
05:00:14.270 --> 05:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
talking about was liquidated damages
 
05:00:16.670 --> 05:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
that may be at issue and comes up often
 
05:00:18.670 --> 05:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
times or is an portion of an asserted
 
05:00:21.310 --> 05:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
claim as it relates to a wage claim the
 
05:00:23.670 --> 05:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
standard for liquidated damages and I'm
 
05:00:25.030 --> 05:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
forgive me I don't have it directly in
 
05:00:26.670 --> 05:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
front of me so I I might not quote it
 
05:00:28.788 --> 05:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
correctly um but it's essentially the
 
05:00:30.990 --> 05:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
the mean and mechanism was there to pay
 
05:00:33.510 --> 05:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
it and the employer knew they needed to
 
05:00:35.590 --> 05:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
pay it but essentially did not it's it's
 
05:00:37.830 --> 05:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
like a willful standard so you know if
 
05:00:40.510 --> 05:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
an employer makes a mistake based on the
 
05:00:44.270 --> 05:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
belief that they are operating as they
 
05:00:45.910 --> 05:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
should be or in accordance with the law
 
05:00:47.708 --> 05:00:47.718 align:start position:0%
and it was not a willful intentional I
 
05:00:49.190 --> 05:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
had the means and mechanisms to pay the
 
05:00:50.350 --> 05:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
money was in the accounts I could have
 
05:00:53.470 --> 05:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
paid the wages I didn't pay the wages
 
05:00:56.990 --> 05:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
um and um I was under you know knew that
 
05:00:58.510 --> 05:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
I needed to pay the wages I was aware I
 
05:01:00.030 --> 05:01:00.040 align:start position:0%
had an obligation to page the wages and
 
05:01:01.548 --> 05:01:01.558 align:start position:0%
I simply didn't that's where liquidated
 
05:01:03.868 --> 05:01:03.878 align:start position:0%
damages is going that's an employee is
 
05:01:06.510 --> 05:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
going to have um a better claim for for
 
05:01:08.030 --> 05:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
liquidated damages so those are all
 
05:01:09.390 --> 05:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
factors that would be looked at in the
 
05:01:11.310 --> 05:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
coarser context of a wage claim so in
 
05:01:13.030 --> 05:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
the scenario we thought the person had
 
05:01:14.948 --> 05:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
passed uh we thought we were doing the
 
05:01:17.030 --> 05:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
right thing as it related to the inter
 
05:01:19.070 --> 05:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
you know to to probate and count was
 
05:01:20.750 --> 05:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
frozen or whatever other factors led
 
05:01:22.230 --> 05:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
into the employer saying I did not pay
 
05:01:23.830 --> 05:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
on time and the employees asserting that
 
05:01:25.510 --> 05:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
they want liquidated damages and it's
 
05:01:28.548 --> 05:01:28.558 align:start position:0%
the I get the percentage wrong 10% or
 
05:01:30.310 --> 05:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
the full or the full amount of the wages
 
05:01:32.270 --> 05:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
whichever is higher might be wrong on
 
05:01:34.110 --> 05:01:34.120 align:start position:0%
the on the percentage those are all
 
05:01:35.390 --> 05:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
factors that would be looked at in
 
05:01:36.948 --> 05:01:36.958 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not the employee
 
05:01:38.510 --> 05:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
had met their burden to demonstrate they
 
05:01:40.390 --> 05:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
actually are entitled to the liquidated
 
05:01:42.830 --> 05:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
damages and again it's not a punitive
 
05:01:44.190 --> 05:01:44.200 align:start position:0%
it's not punitive in the sense that the
 
05:01:45.868 --> 05:01:45.878 align:start position:0%
employer made a mistake it's not a
 
05:01:47.830 --> 05:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
mistakes were made here's the punishment
 
05:01:49.788 --> 05:01:49.798 align:start position:0%
you're you're now being hammered with
 
05:01:51.110 --> 05:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
liquidated damages it's for those
 
05:01:53.150 --> 05:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
willful intentional
 
05:01:56.350 --> 05:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
actions Mr chairman we uh Don and I have
 
05:01:58.150 --> 05:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
been meeting at three o' so I just all
 
05:02:01.708 --> 05:02:01.718 align:start position:0%
right so I think in the interest of time
 
05:02:04.350 --> 05:02:04.360 align:start position:0%
um we have we have the question you can
 
05:02:07.270 --> 05:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
answer quickly and then if you have more
 
05:02:09.868 --> 05:02:09.878 align:start position:0%
information on the other ones um we have
 
05:02:12.390 --> 05:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
plenty of time to receive that as well
 
05:02:14.390 --> 05:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
so I
 
05:02:16.990 --> 05:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
will attempt to make the motion see if
 
05:02:20.230 --> 05:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
it's seconded um that this subcommittee
 
05:02:23.910 --> 05:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
recommend ought to pass as originally
 
05:02:27.788 --> 05:02:27.798 align:start position:0%
filed I'll second
 
05:02:33.948 --> 05:02:33.958 align:start position:0%
okay and all those in favor by right and
 
05:02:35.708 --> 05:02:35.718 align:start position:0%
you oppos oh you're in favor too all
 
05:02:39.830 --> 05:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
right so so that's it um so next time
 
05:02:41.590 --> 05:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
when we meet on Executive this we'll
 
05:02:43.590 --> 05:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
just say something about what the
 
05:02:48.310 --> 05:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:51.990 --> 05:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
change when we receive new information
 
05:02:55.788 --> 05:02:55.798 align:start position:0%
um I will make sure that all members of
 
05:02:59.990 --> 05:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee receive it and if um
 
05:03:01.868 --> 05:03:01.878 align:start position:0%
there is discussion to be had about
 
05:03:05.350 --> 05:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
changes I'll okay discuss that offline
 
05:03:07.788 --> 05:03:07.798 align:start position:0%
and perhaps prepare an amendment thank
 
05:03:09.990 --> 05:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
