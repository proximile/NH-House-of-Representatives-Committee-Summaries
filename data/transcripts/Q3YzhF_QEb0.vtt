to I'm gonna summarize it I'm in a I
 
00:10:19.699 --> 00:10:19.709 align:start position:0%
really missed the the ladies up on the
 
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
fourth floor of the LOB because they
 
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:25.110 align:start position:0%
could I could copy stuff and they would
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
zoom it in and print it out for me and
 
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:30.990 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at tiny little black dots
 
00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:34.019 align:start position:0%
on my tablet they're very difficult to
 
00:10:36.259 --> 00:10:36.269 align:start position:0%
read so I'm gonna let representative
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
well Burt Wolper do most of it but I'll
 
00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:41.420 align:start position:0%
give you a summary of what we did
 
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
basically there was a lot of concerned
 
00:10:48.889 --> 00:10:48.899 align:start position:0%
about eliminating the use of facial
 
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:54.740 align:start position:0%
recognition software entirely and I
 
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:00.390 align:start position:0%
think representative birch and others
 
00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:04.070 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
we're concerned that you know very very
 
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:11.690 align:start position:0%
bad people won't get caught because we
 
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:14.090 align:start position:0%
aren't allowed to use facial recognition
 
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:17.810 align:start position:0%
software I tend to disagree but by the
 
00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:21.500 align:start position:0%
same token I'm only one vote so the
 
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
compromise we reach basically is that
 
00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:28.190 align:start position:0%
all right if facial recognition is used
 
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:31.700 align:start position:0%
it can be used but like everything else
 
00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:33.380 align:start position:0%
you have to have a search warrant
 
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:36.590 align:start position:0%
so that's fundamentally the the primary
 
00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:40.100 align:start position:0%
change of the amendment is so that soft
 
00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:43.430 align:start position:0%
the technology can be used but it can't
 
00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:48.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:53.330 align:start position:0%
hopefully not be abused by requiring a
 
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:55.700 align:start position:0%
search warrant before it's used so it
 
00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:58.310 align:start position:0%
can be still be I believe adequately
 
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:05.300 align:start position:0%
used to find the missing child or or any
 
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:07.700 align:start position:0%
such case or I think representative
 
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
birch were was talking about a facial
 
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:13.970 align:start position:0%
recognition software being used to
 
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:16.130 align:start position:0%
apprehend somebody in Massachusetts and
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
then pursuing them in New Hampshire
 
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:21.890 align:start position:0%
would that evidence negate the case and
 
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:23.750 align:start position:0%
so there's a there's a part in there
 
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:25.790 align:start position:0%
that in any amendment that addresses
 
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:31.430 align:start position:0%
that so fundamentally I think it the
 
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:36.140 align:start position:0%
amendment solves most of the issues that
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
we had when we had our previous session
 
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:42.590 align:start position:0%
I'll turn it over to occur because he he
 
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:44.740 align:start position:0%
can actually read while he's talking
 
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
thank you before before I recognized
 
00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:51.500 align:start position:0%
represented well / representative
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
McGuire has a question yes thank you
 
00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:57.770 align:start position:0%
madam chair I'm afraid that since I was
 
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:00.740 align:start position:0%
a late member I didn't get a copy of the
 
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
amendment of my email and I wondered if
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
I could I can send that right now thank
 
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:12.950 align:start position:0%
you okay now representative Welker thank
 
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:18.210 align:start position:0%
as we go through this we strip down the
 
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
bill quite substantially as Gary
 
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
mentioned the bill started out being a
 
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:27.910 align:start position:0%
ban on the use of the technology we were
 
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
recognizing there's a lot of good uses
 
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
to which is put and just like a lot of
 
00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:34.870 align:start position:0%
things in our world can be put to good
 
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:36.820 align:start position:0%
use or bad and it's our business to
 
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:41.530 align:start position:0%
restrain the bad so that's what we've
 
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
attempted to do so first thing you'll
 
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
notice is that the definitions have been
 
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:49.750 align:start position:0%
reduced because some of the Thracians
 
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:51.670 align:start position:0%
and terminology that we had in the
 
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:54.930 align:start position:0%
original bill weren't applicable anymore
 
00:13:59.280 --> 00:13:59.290 align:start position:0%
so but the remaining definitions are the
 
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:03.100 align:start position:0%
same as they were so it basically covers
 
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:05.290 align:start position:0%
everybody in the whole state everybody
 
00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:08.220 align:start position:0%
that's the state or acts for the state
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the mucus begins on line 15
 
00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
640 424 face recognition technology
 
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:19.540 align:start position:0%
prohibited and it says nobody that is or
 
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:24.610 align:start position:0%
was representative state can use any
 
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:27.190 align:start position:0%
face recognitions recognition system or
 
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:29.170 align:start position:0%
any information obtained from a face
 
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
recognition system but it does not
 
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:37.030 align:start position:0%
prohibit law enforcement agencies from
 
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:39.010 align:start position:0%
lawfully assisting federal agencies that
 
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:41.890 align:start position:0%
joint law enforcement which was one of
 
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:44.500 align:start position:0%
the major concerns that we had and law
 
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:47.140 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency shall not request
 
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:49.570 align:start position:0%
encourage suggests or otherwise initiate
 
00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:52.660 align:start position:0%
access to information or data so so what
 
00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
we're really saying is that you can
 
00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
cooperate with other people who use face
 
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:00.990 align:start position:0%
for face recognition tools but not
 
00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:04.540 align:start position:0%
request that they do so not initiate
 
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
their doing so we don't want any part of
 
00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:10.870 align:start position:0%
that but if they're doing it then you
 
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:14.230 align:start position:0%
can you can accept that cooperate with
 
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.010 align:start position:0%
them and use the data to it just for
 
00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:19.870 align:start position:0%
whatever of lawful purpose you have
 
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:24.330 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
6:44 25 evidence inadmissible
 
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:29.050 align:start position:0%
I need add a collective this isn't
 
00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:30.700 align:start position:0%
virtually the same thing as we had
 
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
before and the idea of it is that we're
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
telling you you can't use this in any if
 
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.160 align:start position:0%
if you're in violation of the
 
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
subdivision so that you can't use it in
 
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:50.260 align:start position:0%
any kind of proceeding within that
 
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
within the state so any hearing any
 
00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:56.290 align:start position:0%
trial hearing proceeding in any court
 
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:00.630 align:start position:0%
grand jury Department officer agency
 
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:04.140 align:start position:0%
regulatory body legislative committee
 
00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:06.940 align:start position:0%
wherever you can't use these things you
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
can't use that information if it were
 
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
obtained in violation of this new
 
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:29.620 align:start position:0%
any trial very proceeding et cetera to
 
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:33.450 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:37.930 align:start position:0%
and anything shall be considered
 
00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:39.370 align:start position:0%
unlawfully obtained and shall be
 
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
irretrievably deleted if it's your law
 
00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:45.700 align:start position:0%
unlawfully obtained person aggrieved by
 
00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:47.650 align:start position:0%
a violation of the subdivision may file
 
00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:49.930 align:start position:0%
for injunctive relief declaratory wait
 
00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:51.430 align:start position:0%
this is the same it's just if you have
 
00:16:52.829 --> 00:16:52.839 align:start position:0%
if your if your rights are being
 
00:16:55.769 --> 00:16:55.779 align:start position:0%
violated by a violation in this
 
00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:57.310 align:start position:0%
subdivision that accretes you a private
 
00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:03.790 align:start position:0%
right of action mine wait a minute where
 
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
I get my evidence admissible home any
 
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
others derive that our information and
 
00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:21.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:25.220 align:start position:0%
whereas I miss something here in reading
 
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.799 --> 00:17:41.809 align:start position:0%
are you on the amendment that's what I'm
 
00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:43.929 align:start position:0%
looking at is he wearing the wrong thing
 
00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:46.820 align:start position:0%
because I call you several of the points
 
00:17:52.539 --> 00:17:52.549 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned have been taken I'm
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:53.849 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned have been taken I'm
sorry

00:17:53.849 --> 00:17:53.859 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:18:12.889 --> 00:18:12.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
all right I can't so the one is of
 
00:18:35.879 --> 00:18:35.889 align:start position:0%
actual paper is that you can just
 
00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:37.809 align:start position:0%
shuffle the papers that's what I'm
 
00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:41.980 align:start position:0%
trying to do right here I think we're
 
00:18:45.299 --> 00:18:45.309 align:start position:0%
all in sympathy representative helper
 
00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:53.730 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:56.950 align:start position:0%
think that the beginning was fine I
 
00:18:59.039 --> 00:18:59.049 align:start position:0%
think you then got into some points that
 
00:19:01.889 --> 00:19:01.899 align:start position:0%
have would no longer relevant in the
 
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:05.250 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah it's true
 
00:19:07.529 --> 00:19:07.539 align:start position:0%
basically we've done is we said you can
 
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:09.700 align:start position:0%
use it for any legal purpose as long as
 
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:13.690 align:start position:0%
you have a warrant and if you if you
 
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:15.220 align:start position:0%
don't have it that's the biggest change
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
in it and and we don't consider the
 
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:27.190 align:start position:0%
warrant requirement to be anything
 
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:29.260 align:start position:0%
onerous at all police officers there
 
00:19:32.149 --> 00:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
warrants all the time and in the case of
 
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
exigent circumstances they get them in a
 
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:37.210 align:start position:0%
matter of minutes so it's something that
 
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:38.860 align:start position:0%
law enforcement is very familiar with
 
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
and they can use at any time they want
 
00:19:43.769 --> 00:19:43.779 align:start position:0%
as long as they have a warrant signed by
 
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
a judge they get a probable cause
 
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:48.490 align:start position:0%
get a warrant from a judge that's what
 
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:51.850 align:start position:0%
they always do when they have to do this
 
00:19:54.029 --> 00:19:54.039 align:start position:0%
type of thing and that's there that's
 
00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
the part that protects against us
 
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:07.110 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
all this is a what I call the purge
 
00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:15.820 align:start position:0%
language which talks about anything
 
00:20:18.419 --> 00:20:18.429 align:start position:0%
obtained is inadmissible unless it's
 
00:20:22.529 --> 00:20:22.539 align:start position:0%
sufficiently tennant attenuated from the
 
00:20:22.539 --> 00:20:23.430 align:start position:0%
sufficiently tennant attenuated from the
event

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
event
 
00:20:26.159 --> 00:20:26.169 align:start position:0%
and all that means is if the information
 
00:20:28.619 --> 00:20:28.629 align:start position:0%
is out there but it had the way it was
 
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:31.570 align:start position:0%
arrived at or derived had nothing at all
 
00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:36.070 align:start position:0%
to do with the actual event then it
 
00:20:37.889 --> 00:20:37.899 align:start position:0%
could be admissible I think
 
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:39.250 align:start position:0%
representative Burks could probably
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
explain that better than I can
 
00:20:44.999 --> 00:20:45.009 align:start position:0%
that's why it's in there because that
 
00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:50.470 align:start position:0%
was one of his concerns and the last
 
00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:51.730 align:start position:0%
thing is the Department of Motor
 
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
Vehicles where we said that the
 
00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:57.730 align:start position:0%
department will not allow people to
 
00:20:59.639 --> 00:20:59.649 align:start position:0%
access their database using this
 
00:21:04.019 --> 00:21:04.029 align:start position:0%
technology because they already have it
 
00:21:07.139 --> 00:21:07.149 align:start position:0%
they already have this big database if
 
00:21:11.879 --> 00:21:11.889 align:start position:0%
you will of fate of faces and we're
 
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
trying to protect the people that have
 
00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:17.620 align:start position:0%
allowed their images to be kept which is
 
00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:20.860 align:start position:0%
on the vast majority of us from fishing
 
00:21:25.499 --> 00:21:25.509 align:start position:0%
expeditions so that's pretty much know
 
00:21:30.619 --> 00:21:30.629 align:start position:0%
the amendment thank you first
 
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:32.620 align:start position:0%
represented burrows and then
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
representative Burke thank you madam
 
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:35.659 align:start position:0%
representative Burke thank you madam
chair

00:21:35.659 --> 00:21:35.669 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative well first wondering if
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
you could tell us which of any
 
00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:43.570 align:start position:0%
stakeholders were involved in the
 
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
preparation of this amendment or who was
 
00:21:49.409 --> 00:21:49.419 align:start position:0%
who who did you who else might have been
 
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
consulted so we really made the
 
00:21:54.779 --> 00:21:54.789 align:start position:0%
amendment among ourselves we didn't have
 
00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion with like Chiefs of
 
00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:01.350 align:start position:0%
Police or people like that we took the
 
00:22:05.759 --> 00:22:05.769 align:start position:0%
concerns and the actual process that we
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
went through is for every concern that
 
00:22:10.499 --> 00:22:10.509 align:start position:0%
had been raised either in the hearing
 
00:22:14.519 --> 00:22:14.529 align:start position:0%
itself or in private conversation after
 
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:15.250 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:18.750 align:start position:0%
we started addressing them one at a time
 
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
after a fair amount of that a lot of
 
00:22:26.539 --> 00:22:26.549 align:start position:0%
changes to the language by various
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
parties we came to the recognition that
 
00:22:33.859 --> 00:22:33.869 align:start position:0%
we could really simplify the whole thing
 
00:22:36.799 --> 00:22:36.809 align:start position:0%
by getting down to this look we
 
00:22:39.289 --> 00:22:39.299 align:start position:0%
using the technology we don't want to be
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
in the technology we don't want to
 
00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:44.190 align:start position:0%
prevent its use for good purposes and we
 
00:22:46.489 --> 00:22:46.499 align:start position:0%
can do that very simply by saying look
 
00:22:49.279 --> 00:22:49.289 align:start position:0%
if you're going to use a technology you
 
00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:52.730 align:start position:0%
have to have a warrant there you go
 
00:23:00.399 --> 00:23:00.409 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:06.059 align:start position:0%
the first thing I want to do is say how
 
00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
much of an improvement I think the
 
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
amendment is over the original bill
 
00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:15.690 align:start position:0%
clearly is an improvement over the
 
00:23:19.999 --> 00:23:20.009 align:start position:0%
original bill and I respect that second
 
00:23:28.029 --> 00:23:28.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
representative Walberg gave to
 
00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
representative burrows no names were
 
00:23:35.659 --> 00:23:35.669 align:start position:0%
mentioned as to who was actually
 
00:23:38.299 --> 00:23:38.309 align:start position:0%
consulted or not other than that generic
 
00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:40.950 align:start position:0%
we I just want to make sure when he
 
00:23:44.239 --> 00:23:44.249 align:start position:0%
talked about compromise and mentioned my
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
name a number of times that it's clear I
 
00:23:51.109 --> 00:23:51.119 align:start position:0%
was not involved in the drafting of this
 
00:23:53.869 --> 00:23:53.879 align:start position:0%
in putting it together in the language
 
00:23:57.619 --> 00:23:57.629 align:start position:0%
in negotiation or anything I got this in
 
00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:00.539 align:start position:0%
the mail and that was the first time
 
00:24:03.109 --> 00:24:03.119 align:start position:0%
that that I saw this amendment so I want
 
00:24:05.659 --> 00:24:05.669 align:start position:0%
to just make sure that that's clear
 
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:08.490 align:start position:0%
since my name was mentioned in the
 
00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:10.590 align:start position:0%
context of this amendment numerous times
 
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:13.950 align:start position:0%
I do want to speak specifically at this
 
00:24:18.489 --> 00:24:18.499 align:start position:0%
point about the warrant aspect because
 
00:24:22.009 --> 00:24:22.019 align:start position:0%
respectfully I think whoever put it
 
00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:25.700 align:start position:0%
together fundamentally misunderstands
 
00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:29.570 align:start position:0%
when and how and what basis warrants are
 
00:24:35.359 --> 00:24:35.369 align:start position:0%
in fact issued and what this amendment
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
does in fact is pretty much maintained
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
the ban that were dresses it up in
 
00:24:48.769 --> 00:24:48.779 align:start position:0%
certain ways okay when an officer wishes
 
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:50.550 align:start position:0%
to get a warrant
 
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
against the person or to search a place
 
00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:56.550 align:start position:0%
and it requires probable cause as is
 
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:00.510 align:start position:0%
mentioned here that means the officer
 
00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:02.550 align:start position:0%
has to go to a court and establish by
 
00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
probable cause a that the crime has been
 
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:08.250 align:start position:0%
committed and be that either evidence of
 
00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:10.650 align:start position:0%
the crime is located in an apartment 3G
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
on Main Street or that this is such and
 
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:16.410 align:start position:0%
such a person is involved in the crime
 
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:20.370 align:start position:0%
and here's my probable cause so that's
 
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
what getting a warrant means now to use
 
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
the example the representative al
 
00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:35.270 align:start position:0%
Shiller gave at our last working session
 
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
let's say a police officer has a seized
 
00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
validly seized computer it has images on
 
00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:48.630 align:start position:0%
it of what peers might be a child that's
 
00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
in a lunar suggestive pose and that's
 
00:25:59.420 --> 00:25:59.430 align:start position:0%
what they have normally now that officer
 
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:03.030 align:start position:0%
might well check the Interpol database
 
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:06.930 align:start position:0%
on Exploited Children to see if they can
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
find a match and thereby note who that
 
00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
person is and what the age of that
 
00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:14.310 align:start position:0%
person is that's how you develop
 
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
probable cause if you're saying the
 
00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
officer has to go to a court first which
 
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
is what this bill says and go to court
 
00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:27.270 align:start position:0%
to get a warrant and show probable cause
 
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:28.740 align:start position:0%
you don't have it all you have is a
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
picture that may or may not be evidence
 
00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
of a crime you may not show a person
 
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
who's under the age that's relevant
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between a person
 
00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:43.490 align:start position:0%
who's naked on a picture h20 in aged 14
 
00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:49.470 align:start position:0%
so that's the problem with this you keep
 
00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
you use the databases to get the
 
00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
probable cause so you can't go to a
 
00:26:59.240 --> 00:26:59.250 align:start position:0%
court with probable cause which is what
 
00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would require now the feds
 
00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:04.050 align:start position:0%
have been dealing with this say
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
issue I know representative oz chiller
 
00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:12.290 align:start position:0%
passed around a letter by email
 
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
referring to a statement by a number of
 
00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:23.730 align:start position:0%
police and prosecuting agencies offering
 
00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:25.950 align:start position:0%
to work at the federal level on this
 
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:29.610 align:start position:0%
issue in fact more recently than that
 
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
letter that letter is back from last
 
00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
October the feds have been looking at
 
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:41.700 align:start position:0%
the warrant issue and there's a proposed
 
00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:43.610 align:start position:0%
bill the facial recognition technology
 
00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:48.930 align:start position:0%
warrant Act which is bipartisan and it
 
00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:53.210 align:start position:0%
says basically that federal officials
 
00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:56.970 align:start position:0%
would be required to seek a warrant in
 
00:27:59.170 --> 00:27:59.180 align:start position:0%
order to use facial recognition
 
00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:03.750 align:start position:0%
technology to track a specific person's
 
00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:07.160 align:start position:0%
public movements for more than 72 hours
 
00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
the difference there is you have an
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
identified person you have probable
 
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:13.740 align:start position:0%
cause you want to sir you want to
 
00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:16.230 align:start position:0%
surveil that person then you go get a
 
00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:21.300 align:start position:0%
warrant this is what the compromise
 
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:24.210 align:start position:0%
looks like and that's what should be in
 
00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:26.550 align:start position:0%
this bill rather than what is in essence
 
00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:31.170 align:start position:0%
a a ban in a different way and I would
 
00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:34.370 align:start position:0%
note for my friend representative hopper
 
00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
that some food called Americans for
 
00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:38.390 align:start position:0%
that some food called Americans for
Prosperity

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
Prosperity
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
you've probably heard them they have
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
weighed in on it and they support the
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
federal view of what kind of warrant
 
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:51.510 align:start position:0%
should be gotten they do not support
 
00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:53.610 align:start position:0%
anything that amounts to a ban and
 
00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:56.390 align:start position:0%
they've been very public about that so
 
00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:00.870 align:start position:0%
hopefully you know if this bill is ITL
 
00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
now and taken up perhaps in another
 
00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:06.270 align:start position:0%
session we can have all the stakeholders
 
00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
come and come up with a warrant
 
00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:11.490 align:start position:0%
requirement that actually works thank
 
00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:14.430 align:start position:0%
you Thank You representative McGuire
 
00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:16.650 align:start position:0%
then representative Griffin then
 
00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:18.570 align:start position:0%
representative out
 
00:29:21.539 --> 00:29:21.549 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire yes thank you
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
madam chair I I was in on the
 
00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:27.340 align:start position:0%
conversations with representative Albarn
 
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:30.130 align:start position:0%
and hopper and the other individuals
 
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:34.090 align:start position:0%
that that were there included professor
 
00:29:38.669 --> 00:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
sheriff from UNH and jean Houska from
 
00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:44.110 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire ACLU the contrite to
 
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
simplify the bill and the intent our
 
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:50.799 align:start position:0%
real concern is that the state is not
 
00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:53.230 align:start position:0%
that the state shouldn't use these
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
existing databases in the information
 
00:29:58.620 --> 00:29:58.630 align:start position:0%
from them what we're concerned with is
 
00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:01.110 align:start position:0%
we don't want the state to create
 
00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:05.950 align:start position:0%
databases and use them so in my opinion
 
00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:08.500 align:start position:0%
the most important element is the last
 
00:30:12.659 --> 00:30:12.669 align:start position:0%
paragraph which takes the only facial
 
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.010 align:start position:0%
database in New Hampshire that in New
 
00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:16.630 align:start position:0%
Hampshire government that I know of at
 
00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:19.090 align:start position:0%
least and says you can't use face
 
00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:23.799 align:start position:0%
recognition on that database because
 
00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:26.530 align:start position:0%
that not only has faces it has a great
 
00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:29.140 align:start position:0%
deal of very personal information that
 
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
we need that we need to protect and we
 
00:30:35.789 --> 00:30:35.799 align:start position:0%
need to protect that now because it's
 
00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:41.730 align:start position:0%
out there it is a without restrictions
 
00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:46.530 align:start position:0%
it could be used by a lot of people to
 
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:49.690 align:start position:0%
identify most almost everybody in the
 
00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:52.450 align:start position:0%
state and not just their face it's got
 
00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:54.580 align:start position:0%
your address it's got your birthday it
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
probably still has some Social Security
 
00:31:00.299 --> 00:31:00.309 align:start position:0%
numbers in there it's information that
 
00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
we that we have that we very much want
 
00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:04.630 align:start position:0%
to protect
 
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
I appreciate representative Burgess
 
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:11.380 align:start position:0%
comments on the search warrant issues
 
00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:12.700 align:start position:0%
because that's something he knows a
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
great deal more about than I do but I
 
00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:18.490 align:start position:0%
think that that's it's a deep I think
 
00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:22.630 align:start position:0%
that is essentially a detail we say that
 
00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:26.380 align:start position:0%
you need a warrant all right well we we
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
can work to develop a better definition
 
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:30.610 align:start position:0%
of a warrant
 
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:34.090 align:start position:0%
sorry but I think that for this year we
 
00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:35.980 align:start position:0%
really need to protect our existing
 
00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:37.890 align:start position:0%
database thank you
 
00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:42.940 align:start position:0%
Thank You representative Griffin thank
 
00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:47.670 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I do want to echo
 
00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:49.750 align:start position:0%
representative Burch in regards to the
 
00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:53.260 align:start position:0%
fact that this was a major change it was
 
00:31:57.810 --> 00:31:57.820 align:start position:0%
an improvement I think to say that the
 
00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:00.670 align:start position:0%
issue in regards to warrant is a detail
 
00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:04.780 align:start position:0%
is problematic because the bill has
 
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:07.270 align:start position:0%
shown such substantial revision that it
 
00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:08.890 align:start position:0%
looks like there were a lot of details
 
00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:10.630 align:start position:0%
that rather than address specifically
 
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:14.860 align:start position:0%
have just been eliminated I am concerned
 
00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:17.710 align:start position:0%
because this is a substantial revision
 
00:32:20.669 --> 00:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
I appreciate this as how amendments
 
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:22.510 align:start position:0%
happen we get them an executive session
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
but there was substantial comment on
 
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.010 align:start position:0%
this bill and I think that more comment
 
00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:32.140 align:start position:0%
on anything such as this amendment is
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
deserved I will note that if you google
 
00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:37.870 align:start position:0%
face recognition technology a term that
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
was revised somewhat I would say
 
00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:44.770 align:start position:0%
substantially from the original bill you
 
00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:47.590 align:start position:0%
get a lot more definitions online and I
 
00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:50.860 align:start position:0%
think we need to that in itself needs a
 
00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:53.260 align:start position:0%
lot more fleshing out I do appreciate
 
00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
that my comment about the motor vehicle
 
00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:57.460 align:start position:0%
provision of this bill was addressed in
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
the Amendment and I did receive a call
 
00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:02.590 align:start position:0%
from her from the Honorable Neel Kirk in
 
00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:05.650 align:start position:0%
regards to this and that the provision
 
00:33:07.919 --> 00:33:07.929 align:start position:0%
had been changed but I am a little
 
00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:09.970 align:start position:0%
concerned to hear that for some people
 
00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:11.770 align:start position:0%
at least the real purpose of this bill
 
00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:16.270 align:start position:0%
was to address that database and if that
 
00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
was the point of this bill then that's
 
00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:21.100 align:start position:0%
what should have been addressed so I am
 
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:23.260 align:start position:0%
was not in favor of the bill and I
 
00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate the work done on the
 
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:26.980 align:start position:0%
amendment but I can't say I've heard
 
00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:29.380 align:start position:0%
anything that's going to make me vote in
 
00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:32.500 align:start position:0%
favor of the amendment Thank You
 
00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:36.700 align:start position:0%
representative al chiller thank you
 
00:33:41.159 --> 00:33:41.169 align:start position:0%
thanks for unmuting agent so I would
 
00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:44.470 align:start position:0%
like to also echo representative birch
 
00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:45.190 align:start position:0%
and Griffin
 
00:33:46.919 --> 00:33:46.929 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that the amendment
 
00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:48.700 align:start position:0%
addressed some of the issues that were
 
00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:50.590 align:start position:0%
brought up at the work session and it
 
00:33:53.119 --> 00:33:53.129 align:start position:0%
shows that there are some a real will
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
towards working to put some guidelines
 
00:34:00.739 --> 00:34:00.749 align:start position:0%
in place that address some of the issues
 
00:34:05.599 --> 00:34:05.609 align:start position:0%
around facial recognition technology
 
00:34:11.279 --> 00:34:11.289 align:start position:0%
that said in reference to representative
 
00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:15.250 align:start position:0%
Burroughs question none of the people
 
00:34:17.369 --> 00:34:17.379 align:start position:0%
who put the amendment together reached
 
00:34:19.919 --> 00:34:19.929 align:start position:0%
out to any of the other stakeholders
 
00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:21.730 align:start position:0%
about their input and I've had
 
00:34:23.369 --> 00:34:23.379 align:start position:0%
significant conversations with
 
00:34:26.279 --> 00:34:26.289 align:start position:0%
lieutenant parati from the New Hampshire
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
Internet crimes against children Task
 
00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:32.919 align:start position:0%
Force and you know I I appreciate the
 
00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:35.740 align:start position:0%
candor of representative Maguire at the
 
00:34:39.089 --> 00:34:39.099 align:start position:0%
our work session and saying that her
 
00:34:42.809 --> 00:34:42.819 align:start position:0%
group in a DNA did not make any because
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
did not take into consideration the
 
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
victim identification program or the
 
00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:50.649 align:start position:0%
seva which is the child victim
 
00:34:55.049 --> 00:34:55.059 align:start position:0%
identification program nor did it you
 
00:34:56.819 --> 00:34:56.829 align:start position:0%
know take into account the sex offender
 
00:34:59.579 --> 00:34:59.589 align:start position:0%
registry or any of the things that are
 
00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:02.740 align:start position:0%
in place right now that we are using
 
00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:06.460 align:start position:0%
right now that would be that would
 
00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:08.980 align:start position:0%
essentially hamstring our law
 
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
enforcement from being able to identify
 
00:35:16.019 --> 00:35:16.029 align:start position:0%
victims and I did hear from the New
 
00:35:19.609 --> 00:35:19.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I CAC that they are on average
 
00:35:23.849 --> 00:35:23.859 align:start position:0%
received 60 cyber tips a month and just
 
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
since the pandemic forced a the
 
00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:32.730 align:start position:0%
quarantine in place their tips are up
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
threefold so this amendment and this
 
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
bill I get where we're going and where
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
we should be going but it actually
 
00:35:47.809 --> 00:35:47.819 align:start position:0%
marginalizes a really vulnerable
 
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:50.710 align:start position:0%
population and I don't think that they
 
00:35:54.779 --> 00:35:54.789 align:start position:0%
are served or our community is served by
 
00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
further pushing them into the shadows
 
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
and make
 
00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:01.070 align:start position:0%
even harder for law enforcement and
 
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:05.020 align:start position:0%
advocates to be able to get to them so I
 
00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:07.490 align:start position:0%
think that this conversation should be
 
00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:10.370 align:start position:0%
continued perhaps in the next session
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
and that those stakeholders should be
 
00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:16.790 align:start position:0%
brought to the table and that it should
 
00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:18.980 align:start position:0%
not necessarily just the one issue
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization that is driving
 
00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:26.180 align:start position:0%
this conversation and that people whose
 
00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:30.110 align:start position:0%
lives are affected immediately in a
 
00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:32.330 align:start position:0%
negative way should be brought to the
 
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:35.590 align:start position:0%
table so that they have some input so
 
00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:40.610 align:start position:0%
Thank You representative Woodbury wait
 
00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:44.630 align:start position:0%
wait now you can go okay thank you madam
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
wait now you can go okay thank you madam
chair

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:46.330 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:49.010 align:start position:0%
you know I agree with the others who
 
00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:51.170 align:start position:0%
just felt that this is a this amendment
 
00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:53.180 align:start position:0%
is a substantial improvement and I
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
intend to vote for it and like many of
 
00:36:59.380 --> 00:36:59.390 align:start position:0%
the people have spoken before me I I am
 
00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:02.060 align:start position:0%
still of the opinion that this whole
 
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:04.810 align:start position:0%
issue is not ready to go
 
00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:07.610 align:start position:0%
well go before the Senate go before the
 
00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:10.130 align:start position:0%
governor and go before the public for
 
00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:11.570 align:start position:0%
all the reasons that have already been
 
00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:15.850 align:start position:0%
expressed one of my I have two concerns
 
00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
and I expressed one of them the other
 
00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
day one is that this bill doesn't really
 
00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:23.210 align:start position:0%
solve the societal problem that we
 
00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:25.820 align:start position:0%
really ought to be working on and that
 
00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:29.450 align:start position:0%
is who who mounts the cameras where and
 
00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:31.490 align:start position:0%
sees what and I think that would
 
00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:33.860 align:start position:0%
certainly tickle representative Harper's
 
00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:37.310 align:start position:0%
not funny bone but his sense of fair
 
00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:40.340 align:start position:0%
play that we'd want we'd want to limit
 
00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:43.490 align:start position:0%
that in a reasonable way so we don't
 
00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:45.830 align:start position:0%
have a surveillance Society
 
00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't regulate that this
 
00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:51.050 align:start position:0%
this bill nibbles around the edge of it
 
00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:54.230 align:start position:0%
in a way that might have some marginal
 
00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:56.060 align:start position:0%
utility but it really doesn't strike
 
00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
home but getting back to this bill even
 
00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:03.460 align:start position:0%
as amended I still have problems
 
00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:05.750 align:start position:0%
although I think I understand it better
 
00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:08.660 align:start position:0%
now with the language found on lines 26
 
00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:10.970 align:start position:0%
through 29 and that
 
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
that's very important language because
 
00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:15.230 align:start position:0%
it's an exception you know to the
 
00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:17.210 align:start position:0%
general rule and you can expect every
 
00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:18.950 align:start position:0%
case that comes up is going to rely on
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
that language and I get a kind of a
 
00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:25.910 align:start position:0%
common sense idea of what its intended
 
00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:28.700 align:start position:0%
to do but I think it requires an awful
 
00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:32.690 align:start position:0%
lot more discussion to prevent you know
 
00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:35.270 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law enforcement and subtly
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
and with a wink and a nod and a nudge
 
00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:41.690 align:start position:0%
nudge encouraging but under the radar
 
00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:43.910 align:start position:0%
encouraging other states which do a
 
00:38:48.819 --> 00:38:48.829 align:start position:0%
facial recognition to to cooperate with
 
00:38:50.859 --> 00:38:50.869 align:start position:0%
us in a New Hampshire prosecution in a
 
00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:52.670 align:start position:0%
way that might not be discoverable
 
00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:55.970 align:start position:0%
I also have another issue with the
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
language of sufficiently attenuated and
 
00:39:01.359 --> 00:39:01.369 align:start position:0%
then they give an example of what what
 
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:03.170 align:start position:0%
might be sufficiently attenuated but
 
00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:04.700 align:start position:0%
they're clearly a whole bunch of other
 
00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:08.630 align:start position:0%
situations that are not so defined and I
 
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
I feel uncomfortable asking a judge to
 
00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:15.910 align:start position:0%
decide what's sufficiently attenuated
 
00:39:19.089 --> 00:39:19.099 align:start position:0%
kind of in a vacuum so I think the whole
 
00:39:22.089 --> 00:39:22.099 align:start position:0%
the whole business there's simply too
 
00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
many loose ends that need a concerted
 
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:30.010 align:start position:0%
hard work to go forward with this and
 
00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:35.140 align:start position:0%
you know basically I'm sympathetic with
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
with the general notion of what's going
 
00:39:39.609 --> 00:39:39.619 align:start position:0%
on but we want to produce something
 
00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:42.500 align:start position:0%
that's worthy of our efforts and right
 
00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:45.770 align:start position:0%
now I don't see it so I intend to vote
 
00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:47.270 align:start position:0%
for the amendment I think it's a good
 
00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:48.770 align:start position:0%
amendment and it's well intended and
 
00:39:51.819 --> 00:39:51.829 align:start position:0%
well met but the the idea of going
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
forward is not for me at this point
 
00:39:57.819 --> 00:39:57.829 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you very much
 
00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:03.710 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan wait wait wait
 
00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:08.510 align:start position:0%
Tim until your can you run there now you
 
00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:09.890 align:start position:0%
go thank you
 
00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:12.230 align:start position:0%
of course some some people wish I'd
 
00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:15.230 align:start position:0%
unmuted all the time but um well first
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
of all I think there is a this is mostly
 
00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:19.730 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the by people watching on
 
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
YouTube if we weren't confused but there
 
00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:24.500 align:start position:0%
was a reference to a hearing we
 
00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:27.470 align:start position:0%
this committee actually you madam chair
 
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
waived the right to the hearing as you
 
00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:30.230 align:start position:0%
meant to the beginning so that we
 
00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:31.700 align:start position:0%
actually said a work session which is
 
00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:33.470 align:start position:0%
slightly different from a public hearing
 
00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:35.990 align:start position:0%
but and in fact I don't think any House
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
Committee has held any public hearing
 
00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:40.700 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about the term section was
 
00:40:42.339 --> 00:40:42.349 align:start position:0%
sufficiently attenuated all the lines
 
00:40:45.069 --> 00:40:45.079 align:start position:0%
from 21 to 29 seem very vague and I
 
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
think and I think it might make it very
 
00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:51.890 align:start position:0%
difficult for any criminal prosecution
 
00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:55.190 align:start position:0%
which involves video or still
 
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
photographs or even driver's licenses
 
00:41:01.089 --> 00:41:01.099 align:start position:0%
because that combined with the blanket
 
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
ban on use of facial technology on page
 
00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:07.790 align:start position:0%
two I think that I think defense
 
00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:10.310 align:start position:0%
attorneys when they do which is uh and I
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
certainly applaud what they do you know
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
finding anything the law to get there
 
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:16.310 align:start position:0%
you know finally we can get to the
 
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
client it's off this might this might
 
00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:21.410 align:start position:0%
make it impossible do they're difficult
 
00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
to prosecute anyone based on video or
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
photographs because they could argue
 
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
that there's no way to prove that facial
 
00:41:30.609 --> 00:41:30.619 align:start position:0%
recognition recognition technology
 
00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:33.290 align:start position:0%
wasn't utilized to prove that the person
 
00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:35.390 align:start position:0%
in the video is the same person that's
 
00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:37.730 align:start position:0%
being prosecuted that seems like a
 
00:41:39.849 --> 00:41:39.859 align:start position:0%
far-fetched theory so I think um this
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
amendment is less bad the original bill
 
00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:44.270 align:start position:0%
but on its own merits I don't think I
 
00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:46.490 align:start position:0%
could I could vote for them certainly
 
00:41:49.329 --> 00:41:49.339 align:start position:0%
this is a issue which even if this bill
 
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
does not pass will we'll be looking at
 
00:41:54.579 --> 00:41:54.589 align:start position:0%
it next year and probably for several
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
years thereafter so I'm I'm still
 
00:41:59.650 --> 00:41:59.660 align:start position:0%
opposed to this amendment even though
 
00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:02.270 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's an improvement as
 
00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:05.530 align:start position:0%
others have said over the original bill
 
00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:08.510 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:11.930 align:start position:0%
Wolper I think is next wait and see now
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
you can go thank you madam chair so I'm
 
00:42:20.109 --> 00:42:20.119 align:start position:0%
going to take take these so first of all
 
00:42:21.849 --> 00:42:21.859 align:start position:0%
in terms of what representative all
 
00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:24.410 align:start position:0%
Shores are concerned about all the
 
00:42:26.349 --> 00:42:26.359 align:start position:0%
actual usages and the importance of
 
00:42:28.329 --> 00:42:28.339 align:start position:0%
using facial recognition technology
 
00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:31.460 align:start position:0%
today I don't see anything in this bill
 
00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:33.140 align:start position:0%
that would inhibit that any much of any
 
00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
way if you got a chip that there's such
 
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:36.500 align:start position:0%
way if you got a chip that there's such
a

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:36.510 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
illicit activity the police begin their
 
00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:42.150 align:start position:0%
investigation they have reason to
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
believe that there's an actual crime
 
00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
they want to identify the victim that
 
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:49.590 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a problem they should be
 
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:51.090 align:start position:0%
able to go to Anjali's very easily and
 
00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:52.830 align:start position:0%
say look we're investigating this crime
 
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
we need to use this technology to
 
00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:56.970 align:start position:0%
identify the victim and the judge will
 
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
say okay fine here you go
 
00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:02.430 align:start position:0%
shouldn't take long at all and it
 
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:03.810 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it just shouldn't be much of a
 
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:07.050 align:start position:0%
hurdle at all even in the case of amber
 
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
Horace we we actually talked about this
 
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
when we were constructedness lenska we
 
00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:13.100 align:start position:0%
had all kinds of language in there
 
00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:15.090 align:start position:0%
trying to address the things that
 
00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:17.130 align:start position:0%
representative also or listed both at
 
00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:20.070 align:start position:0%
the hearing and again today but it came
 
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
down to all these things are still
 
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
allowable or allowed under this bill as
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
long as there's a good reason and that's
 
00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:31.170 align:start position:0%
what the Lawrence of Art is it says you
 
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
have to have a good reason I don't see
 
00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
why that should be a very big issue it's
 
00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:40.890 align:start position:0%
a similar situation with with lions 21
 
00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
to 29
 
00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:46.110 align:start position:0%
mine's 21 to 29 are there to say we
 
00:43:50.770 --> 00:43:50.780 align:start position:0%
don't the state if the state initiates
 
00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:54.390 align:start position:0%
ill unlawfully the use of this
 
00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:57.690 align:start position:0%
technology then that whatever it gets
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
out of that will be inadmissible but if
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
you can show that the data received
 
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:07.350 align:start position:0%
through this
 
00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:12.690 align:start position:0%
that's paragraph 1 and 2 deals with
 
00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:17.690 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:20.010 align:start position:0%
because number 1 says the state can't
 
00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
initiate this in any way at all number 2
 
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
says if you get it from somebody else
 
00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:27.930 align:start position:0%
and it has its it's not related at all
 
00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:33.390 align:start position:0%
to the state's requests or anything like
 
00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:35.310 align:start position:0%
that it's good it's just something
 
00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:37.410 align:start position:0%
that's out there like we're talking
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
about with the international databases
 
00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
then that's that what the sufficiently
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
attenuated is is intended to get at all
 
00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
right if it's derived from other
 
00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:52.890 align:start position:0%
sources have nothing to do with what
 
00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:54.930 align:start position:0%
we're talking about that the states and
 
00:44:57.350 --> 00:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
actual use then it should be still
 
00:44:59.900 --> 00:44:59.910 align:start position:0%
admissible so and I think we've done I
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
think this really addresses all those
 
00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:04.620 align:start position:0%
concerns as far as addressing every
 
00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:06.570 align:start position:0%
concern to a specialist and recognition
 
00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
software no and I we can't do that but
 
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
we can do this which is a major step
 
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
toward protecting the rights of our
 
00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:22.650 align:start position:0%
citizens without burdening in any
 
00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:25.650 align:start position:0%
significant way at all the opportunity
 
00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:38.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
we're planted whop are you finished I am
 
00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:52.290 align:start position:0%
finished representatives hopper yeah
 
00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:54.110 align:start position:0%
thank you and I appreciate
 
00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
representative you know last last week I
 
00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:01.650 align:start position:0%
fully expected you know representative
 
00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:05.250 align:start position:0%
birch to throw me under the bus I just
 
00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:11.250 align:start position:0%
didn't know you know representative
 
00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
Griffin was going to jump in the bus and
 
00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:19.430 align:start position:0%
back it up but now representative Harper
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
moving on so I don't understand that the
 
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
issue my understanding is that if a
 
00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:31.770 align:start position:0%
police officer pulls me over and they
 
00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:33.750 align:start position:0%
see something they find suspicious in
 
00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
the back seat and they ask to search the
 
00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:39.270 align:start position:0%
car and I say no they have to get a
 
00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:41.670 align:start position:0%
warrant this is what this might be old
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
information and they call a judge and
 
00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:47.190 align:start position:0%
they say they believe something's in the
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
back seat can I get a warrant they get a
 
00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
back seat can I get a warrant they get a
warrant

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:49.530 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:51.890 align:start position:0%
I believe it only takes minutes I don't
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
understand why there would be an issue
 
00:46:58.610 --> 00:46:58.620 align:start position:0%
if a police officer saw what he believed
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
to be a 12 year old girl in some video
 
00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:06.510 align:start position:0%
how it would be cumbersome for him to
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
get a a warrant from a judge when he
 
00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:11.970 align:start position:0%
said I believe this is a child that's
 
00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:14.820 align:start position:0%
being abused and I get a warrant to run
 
00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:18.990 align:start position:0%
her face through a database I don't see
 
00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:22.470 align:start position:0%
why that's an issue and I think in doing
 
00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:25.170 align:start position:0%
so we do protect a lot of people's
 
00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:28.350 align:start position:0%
Liberty so that police officers aren't
 
00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:33.210 align:start position:0%
just using the software arbitrarily or
 
00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:36.570 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly so I don't get I don't get
 
00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:40.950 align:start position:0%
the problem thanks representative
 
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
dilorenzo wait can you okay now well
 
00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
thank you managed here there's a few
 
00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
things that I'd like to say about my
 
00:47:58.730 --> 00:47:58.740 align:start position:0%
thoughts on the bill
 
00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
I think the amendment is an improvement
 
00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:03.810 align:start position:0%
and I'm waiting towards voting for the
 
00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:06.770 align:start position:0%
amendment but I think the bill as a
 
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
whole needs more work I did read the
 
00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:17.730 align:start position:0%
Senate bill that is in the hopper down
 
00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:22.770 align:start position:0%
in Washington and it looks like a really
 
00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:25.590 align:start position:0%
good bill and the bill is tight if we're
 
00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:31.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:36.030 align:start position:0%
introduced on February 12 2020 and the
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
title of the bill is ethical use of
 
00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:41.490 align:start position:0%
facial recognition Act exactly a
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
commission find the use of facial
 
00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
recognition technology and it brings
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
together you know stakeholders to really
 
00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:53.910 align:start position:0%
hash it out and talk about a party and
 
00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:55.170 align:start position:0%
that's what I feel like we should be
 
00:48:59.210 --> 00:48:59.220 align:start position:0%
doing secondly I was initially
 
00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:02.850 align:start position:0%
ambivalent about 1642 but after reading
 
00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
the written testimony in opposition to
 
00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm feeling that the brakes
 
00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
must be put on unethical use of facial
 
00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:16.690 align:start position:0%
recognition technology now for instance
 
00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:19.420 align:start position:0%
a letter from a woman was representing
 
00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:22.390 align:start position:0%
TechNet the voice of the innovation
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
economy and that group is a bipartisan
 
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:30.010 align:start position:0%
network of over 80 technology companies
 
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:31.720 align:start position:0%
that promote the growth of innovation
 
00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:40.270 align:start position:0%
economy I sent an email to the executive
 
00:49:42.809 --> 00:49:42.819 align:start position:0%
director Christina Fisher of TechNet
 
00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:45.940 align:start position:0%
asking her for a list of the 80
 
00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:48.730 align:start position:0%
companies that are involved and TechNet
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
and she wrote back to me and said that
 
00:49:53.609 --> 00:49:53.619 align:start position:0%
she wouldn't have time to get all the
 
00:49:56.849 --> 00:49:56.859 align:start position:0%
information questioned but she did send
 
00:49:59.130 --> 00:49:59.140 align:start position:0%
a little blurb about the names of the
 
00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:01.930 align:start position:0%
companies and I can go through the list
 
00:50:03.839 --> 00:50:03.849 align:start position:0%
very quickly a paschal is very quickly
 
00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
we're looking at Amazon Apple AT&amp;T Cisco
 
00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:10.810 align:start position:0%
Comcast credit common deltek eBay
 
00:50:14.609 --> 00:50:14.619 align:start position:0%
Facebook GM Google Google Hewlett
 
00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:18.190 align:start position:0%
Packard Microsoft Oracle PayPal you
 
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:21.010 align:start position:0%
Oberer Verizon and Beezer just to name a
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
few and it really concerns me that those
 
00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:28.270 align:start position:0%
groups are in up those groups are in
 
00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:32.710 align:start position:0%
opposition to on our 1642 and my god is
 
00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:33.970 align:start position:0%
that they they're gonna make a profit
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
out of Facebook facial recognition
 
00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:38.470 align:start position:0%
technology so they don't want it to beat
 
00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:41.470 align:start position:0%
any brakes on it so that has raised my
 
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
apples and they're really concerns me
 
00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:48.930 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you everything a perch
 
00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:51.730 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll attempt to be briefer
 
00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:56.050 align:start position:0%
this time in response to the last
 
00:50:58.800 --> 00:50:58.810 align:start position:0%
comments I think there's ways to get to
 
00:51:01.559 --> 00:51:01.569 align:start position:0%
yes eventually in this subject and I
 
00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:03.490 align:start position:0%
think if we can get the stakeholders
 
00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:06.490 align:start position:0%
together that we deal with here in New
 
00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:10.810 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that that can happen and it's
 
00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:12.670 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons I appreciate the
 
00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:15.250 align:start position:0%
effort that has gone in so far on the
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
amendment to answer representative
 
00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:23.140 align:start position:0%
hopper real quick if you go to a judge
 
00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:25.180 align:start position:0%
with a picture and you say I've got a
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
hunch that this is a picture of an
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
underage kid you're not going to get
 
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:33.010 align:start position:0%
warrant unless you really like super
 
00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:34.839 align:start position:0%
activist judges who's just going to
 
00:51:37.049 --> 00:51:37.059 align:start position:0%
decide oh we'll just going to go search
 
00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:39.490 align:start position:0%
anybody that the cop has a hunch about I
 
00:51:41.789 --> 00:51:41.799 align:start position:0%
have a hunch there's drugs in that guy's
 
00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:44.950 align:start position:0%
apartment I don't have any evidence but
 
00:51:46.559 --> 00:51:46.569 align:start position:0%
I have a hunch you're not gonna get a
 
00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:50.500 align:start position:0%
warrant that's the problem
 
00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:56.290 align:start position:0%
finally I wrestled myself with whether
 
00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:58.210 align:start position:0%
to vote for the amendment because it's
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
an improvement even though I'm
 
00:52:02.539 --> 00:52:02.549 align:start position:0%
definitely gonna vote against the bill
 
00:52:05.099 --> 00:52:05.109 align:start position:0%
I've worked in this field I've
 
00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:08.230 align:start position:0%
represented individuals charged with
 
00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:11.770 align:start position:0%
child exploitation I'm familiar with how
 
00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
police investigate these crimes I'm
 
00:52:17.609 --> 00:52:17.619 align:start position:0%
familiar with the databases and the like
 
00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:21.640 align:start position:0%
and one thing I know is right now in
 
00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:24.970 align:start position:0%
Keene detective McLaughlin is sitting
 
00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:26.980 align:start position:0%
there on the telephone having
 
00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:28.750 align:start position:0%
conversations pretending to be an
 
00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:32.230 align:start position:0%
underage person with some pervert in
 
00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:36.940 align:start position:0%
another state and those folks are highly
 
00:52:39.569 --> 00:52:39.579 align:start position:0%
mobile they will come to New Hampshire
 
00:52:42.059 --> 00:52:42.069 align:start position:0%
and they will get arrested they will
 
00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:44.290 align:start position:0%
come to wherever they think they can
 
00:52:48.289 --> 00:52:48.299 align:start position:0%
prey on a child and if the word gets out
 
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:53.220 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has the least
 
00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:58.210 align:start position:0%
effective method for apprehending sexual
 
00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:02.410 align:start position:0%
predators then I think we're gonna have
 
00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:05.170 align:start position:0%
some problems and I can tell you I
 
00:53:09.059 --> 00:53:09.069 align:start position:0%
wasn't elected by my constituents to
 
00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:13.720 align:start position:0%
make it easier for people who sexually
 
00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:16.660 align:start position:0%
offend come to New Hampshire and
 
00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:19.540 align:start position:0%
potentially not have to worry as much as
 
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
in their home state so I'm gonna vote
 
00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:23.290 align:start position:0%
against the amendment as well as the
 
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:32.010 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.569 --> 00:53:36.579 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning nice
 
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:40.510 align:start position:0%
to hear your voice good morning first of
 
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
all I think I agree with the chair about
 
00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:43.150 align:start position:0%
all I think I agree with the chair about
the

00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:45.350 align:start position:0%
process of holding meetings via video
 
00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:51.110 align:start position:0%
it's difficult secondly I think the
 
00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:53.750 align:start position:0%
biggest issue having to do with this
 
00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:56.750 align:start position:0%
face recognition question has to do with
 
00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:00.680 align:start position:0%
databases and the databases that are
 
00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:03.410 align:start position:0%
slurped up by our friends at Google and
 
00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:08.570 align:start position:0%
Windows and Microsoft the Apple there
 
00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:11.300 align:start position:0%
are databases all over the place they
 
00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:14.390 align:start position:0%
are not state actors but frankly we are
 
00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:16.490 align:start position:0%
almost to the point where it's really
 
00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:17.810 align:start position:0%
hard to tell the difference
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
I find this troubling and I think this
 
00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:27.320 align:start position:0%
is police state in the in the making so
 
00:54:30.970 --> 00:54:30.980 align:start position:0%
I support this bill if we have to have
 
00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:33.560 align:start position:0%
this amendment to pass this bill and
 
00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
I'll support that but this is this is
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
very troubling stuff these databases
 
00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:44.230 align:start position:0%
while we may think they're protecting
 
00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
victims and children we know that
 
00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:51.590 align:start position:0%
fellows like Jeffrey Epstein had access
 
00:54:56.590 --> 00:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
to the highest government officials in
 
00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
this country including presidents on
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
both sides of the aisle
 
00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:06.050 align:start position:0%
not to mention Bill Gates these
 
00:55:08.650 --> 00:55:08.660 align:start position:0%
databases are being accessed by the
 
00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:11.900 align:start position:0%
worst of people and the database is the
 
00:55:14.410 --> 00:55:14.420 align:start position:0%
problem facial-recognition we're to the
 
00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:17.900 align:start position:0%
point where faces can be altered in
 
00:55:21.490 --> 00:55:21.500 align:start position:0%
videos there are a lot of problems here
 
00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:24.860 align:start position:0%
so I'm supporting this bill and if it
 
00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:26.750 align:start position:0%
takes the amendment to pass it then I'll
 
00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
support that too thank you very much
 
00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:35.030 align:start position:0%
a representative well / thank you madam
 
00:55:38.590 --> 00:55:38.600 align:start position:0%
chair I just said first of all I present
 
00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
the implication from representative
 
00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
birds that we're trying to make it
 
00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:47.690 align:start position:0%
easier for people to be molested but
 
00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:49.880 align:start position:0%
beyond that we're not doing that if we
 
00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:51.530 align:start position:0%
got a plea if you get a police officer
 
00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:53.180 align:start position:0%
and he's having a doing a sting
 
00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:54.140 align:start position:0%
and he's having a doing a sting
operation

00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:54.150 align:start position:0%
operation
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
and he identifies he's gonna identify
 
00:56:03.559 --> 00:56:03.569 align:start position:0%
the perpetrator not the victim and I'm
 
00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:06.930 align:start position:0%
understanding why what we're doing here
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
would make any difference in that
 
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
particular case even if the individual
 
00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:14.390 align:start position:0%
came to New Hampshire to moist a child
 
00:56:16.519 --> 00:56:16.529 align:start position:0%
we still wouldn't have a picture of the
 
00:56:19.249 --> 00:56:19.259 align:start position:0%
child but if we did get a picture of the
 
00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
child and in connection with that sting
 
00:56:26.329 --> 00:56:26.339 align:start position:0%
operation then I can't imagine how it
 
00:56:29.029 --> 00:56:29.039 align:start position:0%
would be very difficult even even
 
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
difficult to get a warrant to identify
 
00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:37.460 align:start position:0%
the child or even the perpetrator
 
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
because there'll be huge amounts of
 
00:56:42.499 --> 00:56:42.509 align:start position:0%
probable cause so I I'm just not
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
understanding and I hear this objection
 
00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:45.930 align:start position:0%
over and over but I just don't
 
00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:49.650 align:start position:0%
understand how those objections are
 
00:56:53.569 --> 00:56:53.579 align:start position:0%
valid I just don't see it in terms of
 
00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:55.950 align:start position:0%
representative or Jean Lorenzo and all
 
00:56:58.370 --> 00:56:58.380 align:start position:0%
of those TechNet people those are all
 
00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:00.420 align:start position:0%
private actors this bill has nothing to
 
00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
do with them it doesn't affect what they
 
00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
do what one iota so I still think it's a
 
00:57:08.749 --> 00:57:08.759 align:start position:0%
good bill and in representing Canada
 
00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:11.190 align:start position:0%
we'll address to begin to address what I
 
00:57:13.489 --> 00:57:13.499 align:start position:0%
think is a potentially serious problem
 
00:57:15.979 --> 00:57:15.989 align:start position:0%
and we see this problem in various
 
00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:18.150 align:start position:0%
places around the world already well I
 
00:57:19.609 --> 00:57:19.619 align:start position:0%
think we need to take action and should
 
00:57:23.529 --> 00:57:23.539 align:start position:0%
do so now thank you
 
00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
Thank You representative out Shore thank
 
00:57:31.039 --> 00:57:31.049 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I just want to highlight
 
00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:36.210 align:start position:0%
that this debate has has really brought
 
00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
forth why it would be important to have
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders at the table for this
 
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
conversation and that the exclusion of
 
00:57:47.839 --> 00:57:47.849 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Internet crimes
 
00:57:50.479 --> 00:57:50.489 align:start position:0%
against children Task Force and the
 
00:57:55.069 --> 00:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
exclusion of law enforcement and the
 
00:57:58.660 --> 00:57:58.670 align:start position:0%
exclusion of crime victims advocates in
 
00:58:02.509 --> 00:58:02.519 align:start position:0%
bringing this in having a say in how
 
00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:04.310 align:start position:0%
this comes forward
 
00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:07.730 align:start position:0%
is really really important because if we
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
because clearly I have not been clear
 
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:15.710 align:start position:0%
enough and eloquent enough to get that
 
00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:18.470 align:start position:0%
point across and to make that understood
 
00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:22.750 align:start position:0%
representative well / and perhaps maybe
 
00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:24.650 align:start position:0%
representative birch has not been able
 
00:58:27.730 --> 00:58:27.740 align:start position:0%
to explain that well enough to
 
00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
representative well / but it would be
 
00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:31.430 align:start position:0%
helpful I think if you were to hear
 
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
directly from the stakeholders for whom
 
00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:37.160 align:start position:0%
this would have an immediate and
 
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
negative impact so that we could have a
 
00:58:42.130 --> 00:58:42.140 align:start position:0%
conversation about what would be
 
00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:44.540 align:start position:0%
appropriate guidelines for the use of
 
00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:47.540 align:start position:0%
facial recognition technology so that it
 
00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:50.870 align:start position:0%
doesn't impact current use through
 
00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:55.640 align:start position:0%
databases like the C VIP and the VIP and
 
00:58:58.540 --> 00:58:58.550 align:start position:0%
your being able to find out more about
 
00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:00.950 align:start position:0%
those databases and how facial
 
00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:04.220 align:start position:0%
recognition technology is used in the
 
00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:09.250 align:start position:0%
identification of victims prior to
 
00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:12.140 align:start position:0%
warrants being issued how those
 
00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:15.830 align:start position:0%
children's exploited videos are passed
 
00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:20.300 align:start position:0%
around and being you know manufactured
 
00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:23.060 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire then
 
00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:25.910 align:start position:0%
that maybe we could write this in a way
 
00:59:28.690 --> 00:59:28.700 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't hurt them at the same
 
00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
time so I would encourage my colleagues
 
00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:39.070 align:start position:0%
to to put a pin in this discussion of
 
00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:41.570 align:start position:0%
overall not this discussion in this
 
00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:43.850 align:start position:0%
moment but the discussion about facial
 
00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:46.940 align:start position:0%
recognition technology for a time when
 
00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
more stake holders can be present and
 
00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:52.550 align:start position:0%
can give their input and are consulted
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
because one issue advocacy group is not
 
00:59:59.350 --> 00:59:59.360 align:start position:0%
hitting all the marks for all of the
 
01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:00.770 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that would be affected
 
01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:04.250 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much and thank
 
01:00:06.490 --> 01:00:06.500 align:start position:0%
you to all the members of the committee
 
01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
who have chosen to speak up until now I
 
01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
have a couple of comments that I would
 
01:00:16.810 --> 01:00:16.820 align:start position:0%
like to make this
 
01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:20.570 align:start position:0%
had a full and thorough hearing before
 
01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:28.150 align:start position:0%
EDA it had a work session to which
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
everybody was invited so in those cases
 
01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:35.990 align:start position:0%
there were many opportunities in
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
addition the members of the Judiciary
 
01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:44.450 align:start position:0%
Committee each and every one of us had
 
01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:47.480 align:start position:0%
the opportunity knowing that we were
 
01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:50.690 align:start position:0%
having an executive session today to
 
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:55.010 align:start position:0%
come in with an amendment they could
 
01:00:59.230 --> 01:00:59.240 align:start position:0%
have an amendment that says because this
 
01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:02.540 align:start position:0%
is an important issue we believe that we
 
01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:06.410 align:start position:0%
want to send this to interim study I'm
 
01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:08.900 align:start position:0%
just making this up as an example they
 
01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:11.180 align:start position:0%
could have an amendment that says this
 
01:01:14.350 --> 01:01:14.360 align:start position:0%
could apply in situations except in
 
01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:18.410 align:start position:0%
situations of child abuse child
 
01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:21.490 align:start position:0%
pornography where they could have said a
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
thousand possibilities and no one came
 
01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:30.700 align:start position:0%
in with an amendment except
 
01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:35.330 align:start position:0%
representatives hopper and Welker no one
 
01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:38.120 align:start position:0%
was denied an opportunity to come in
 
01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:42.290 align:start position:0%
with an amendment so that if your
 
01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:45.850 align:start position:0%
position is you don't like this bill
 
01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:50.510 align:start position:0%
that's fine but if your position is that
 
01:01:57.250 --> 01:01:57.260 align:start position:0%
you didn't have a chance to have your
 
01:02:01.330 --> 01:02:01.340 align:start position:0%
views represented in the bill there was
 
01:02:03.550 --> 01:02:03.560 align:start position:0%
a hearing there was a work session and
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
there was today where there were
 
01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:09.550 align:start position:0%
opportunities for anyone and everyone
 
01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:13.610 align:start position:0%
well anyone up until and everyone for
 
01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:17.080 align:start position:0%
the hearing and the work session today a
 
01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:19.550 align:start position:0%
amendment could only come in from a
 
01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:23.720 align:start position:0%
member of the Judiciary Committee but
 
01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:27.320 align:start position:0%
that leaves close to 2,000 of us who
 
01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:29.060 align:start position:0%
could have come in with an amendment and
 
01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:31.910 align:start position:0%
only two people did
 
01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:34.910 align:start position:0%
as we all know I'm not a lawyer I don't
 
01:02:37.690 --> 01:02:37.700 align:start position:0%
play one on TV I don't even play one in
 
01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:40.700 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee being married to
 
01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
a lawyer for half a century doesn't
 
01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
count I understand so I know a lot of
 
01:02:53.590 --> 01:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
problems with the law on both sides on
 
01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:55.790 align:start position:0%
all sides but I don't know a lot of
 
01:02:57.370 --> 01:02:57.380 align:start position:0%
answers so I'm going to ask some
 
01:03:00.370 --> 01:03:00.380 align:start position:0%
questions and perhaps somebody can
 
01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:03.050 align:start position:0%
answer them for me let's do a
 
01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:09.310 align:start position:0%
hypothetical the police doing their work
 
01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:12.830 align:start position:0%
have images from a child pornography
 
01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:16.220 align:start position:0%
video they want to identify the child in
 
01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:22.610 align:start position:0%
the video they have probable cause to
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
believe an unidentified child is the
 
01:03:28.690 --> 01:03:28.700 align:start position:0%
victim of sexual abuse and they believe
 
01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:31.900 align:start position:0%
using facial recognition technology
 
01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:36.670 align:start position:0%
might provide the identity of the child
 
01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:41.210 align:start position:0%
is there a place in this amendment where
 
01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:46.810 align:start position:0%
they would be prohibited from proceeding
 
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
to get a warrant or where they would be
 
01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:53.980 align:start position:0%
prohibited where the judge would feel
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
that he could not grant a warrant okay I
 
01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:03.170 align:start position:0%
don't see any hand so I'm going to go on
 
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
police have a missing child in custody
 
01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:10.970 align:start position:0%
or have a picture of a child they think
 
01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:14.750 align:start position:0%
is missing they want to run a picture of
 
01:04:17.410 --> 01:04:17.420 align:start position:0%
that child's through the database to see
 
01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:20.870 align:start position:0%
if there's because they have evidence to
 
01:04:24.130 --> 01:04:24.140 align:start position:0%
believe the child is missing but the
 
01:04:26.410 --> 01:04:26.420 align:start position:0%
child's lack of name or inability to
 
01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:31.730 align:start position:0%
communicate might be because the child
 
01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:34.490 align:start position:0%
isn't shocked the child is lying they
 
01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:37.670 align:start position:0%
don't know but they believe this is a
 
01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:42.230 align:start position:0%
missing child is there anything in this
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
missing child is there anything in this
I'm

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:43.770 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:46.980 align:start position:0%
that would say that they couldn't go to
 
01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:49.890 align:start position:0%
a judge in that any reasonable judge and
 
01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:51.390 align:start position:0%
not all judges are reasonable
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
just as not all lawyers are reasonable
 
01:04:59.000 --> 01:04:59.010 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't get a warrant what if
 
01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:02.150 align:start position:0%
the police have what they believe are
 
01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:05.910 align:start position:0%
unidentified human trafficking victims
 
01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:08.820 align:start position:0%
they're victims of crime and they're
 
01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:13.110 align:start position:0%
found in a house the police have
 
01:05:15.590 --> 01:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
probable cause to believe a crime has
 
01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:18.270 align:start position:0%
been committed committed and that they
 
01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
will discover the identity of the crime
 
01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:24.270 align:start position:0%
victims by running them through the
 
01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:29.250 align:start position:0%
database can you tell me where in this
 
01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
bill the police would not be able to get
 
01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:36.570 align:start position:0%
a warrant and those are just questions
 
01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
and I don't know the answers and I would
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
recognize representative birch thank you
 
01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:49.830 align:start position:0%
madam chair you you kind of set it up by
 
01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:52.290 align:start position:0%
saying I'll use your first example that
 
01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:54.570 align:start position:0%
the police have probable cause to
 
01:05:59.300 --> 01:05:59.310 align:start position:0%
believe that this child may have been a
 
01:05:59.310 --> 01:06:00.950 align:start position:0%
believe that this child may have been a
victim

01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
victim
 
01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:04.430 align:start position:0%
is there anything blocking getting a
 
01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:07.770 align:start position:0%
warrant from a judge under this bill the
 
01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:10.530 align:start position:0%
question is is you don't know that that
 
01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
image is of a child just to start so
 
01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
when you define it ahead of time is
 
01:06:18.350 --> 01:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
saying there's probable cause you've
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
begged the question and you did it
 
01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:23.130 align:start position:0%
really in all three questions you all
 
01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:27.330 align:start position:0%
you have in essence is let's say a
 
01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:31.290 align:start position:0%
photograph of a human being in a
 
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:35.010 align:start position:0%
suggestive pose you do not know if that
 
01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:38.310 align:start position:0%
is a child or not and therefore you do
 
01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:41.250 align:start position:0%
not know if there is a crime involved or
 
01:06:43.850 --> 01:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
not and that's the first question you
 
01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:46.230 align:start position:0%
may get from a judge that's why these
 
01:06:49.850 --> 01:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
databases are so important because they
 
01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:53.070 align:start position:0%
take all these victims of sexual
 
01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:55.170 align:start position:0%
exploitation they identify them because
 
01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
they just circulate on the inner
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
st. pictures or a lot of the same
 
01:07:01.530 --> 01:07:01.540 align:start position:0%
pictures and they they figure out who
 
01:07:04.339 --> 01:07:04.349 align:start position:0%
these people are and what their ages
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
because there's different issues if the
 
01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:11.410 align:start position:0%
person is 15 person is 20 so that's the
 
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
problem in your various examples that
 
01:07:17.730 --> 01:07:17.740 align:start position:0%
there there isn't probable cause I would
 
01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:20.050 align:start position:0%
respond to that by saying I'm not a
 
01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:23.500 align:start position:0%
lawyer I'm not a doctor I'm not an
 
01:07:27.329 --> 01:07:27.339 align:start position:0%
anthropologist I'm not a social worker
 
01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:32.410 align:start position:0%
or not lots of things but what I am is a
 
01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:37.990 align:start position:0%
thinking I hope conscientious I hope
 
01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
honorable individual and I like any
 
01:07:46.319 --> 01:07:46.329 align:start position:0%
trained police officer looking at a
 
01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:52.470 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:57.730 align:start position:0%
14 or 16 or 18 but they're sure going to
 
01:08:00.450 --> 01:08:00.460 align:start position:0%
know if that person is six or eight or
 
01:08:05.309 --> 01:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
ten or twelve and maybe a lot more
 
01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:08.260 align:start position:0%
specifically than that they have reason
 
01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:11.290 align:start position:0%
to believe perhaps using the word
 
01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:13.290 align:start position:0%
probable cause
 
01:08:18.419 --> 01:08:18.429 align:start position:0%
representative birch was an error on my
 
01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:21.370 align:start position:0%
part because I deign to use a technical
 
01:08:25.019 --> 01:08:25.029 align:start position:0%
word rather than just a word of an
 
01:08:29.039 --> 01:08:29.049 align:start position:0%
ordinary Joe or Jane walking along
 
01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:30.699 align:start position:0%
without that kind of professional
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
training but the examples I gave if you
 
01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:39.130 align:start position:0%
did not want to immediately look to find
 
01:08:45.329 --> 01:08:45.339 align:start position:0%
the weakest point I think I hope caused
 
01:08:52.349 --> 01:08:52.359 align:start position:0%
us to think about the implications of
 
01:08:57.599 --> 01:08:57.609 align:start position:0%
this I also do want to say that a number
 
01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:06.850 align:start position:0%
of members of the the professional
 
01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
of members of the the professional
police

01:09:10.079 --> 01:09:10.089 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:16.030 --> 01:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
cohort object very strongly to this bill
 
01:09:18.519 --> 01:09:18.529 align:start position:0%
and to many others that come before the
 
01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:22.130 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee because they say you
 
01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:27.230 align:start position:0%
are trying to limit our power and my
 
01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:30.710 align:start position:0%
answer to that and I'd stand up straight
 
01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:32.750 align:start position:0%
if I could stand up and still have my
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
head before the the camera the yes that
 
01:09:42.129 --> 01:09:42.139 align:start position:0%
is exactly what we are doing that is
 
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
what our job is to do in a democratic
 
01:09:49.450 --> 01:09:49.460 align:start position:0%
society to make sure that we give the
 
01:09:53.979 --> 01:09:53.989 align:start position:0%
police every tool that is necessary for
 
01:09:57.839 --> 01:09:57.849 align:start position:0%
them to carry out their jobs and that is
 
01:10:01.479 --> 01:10:01.489 align:start position:0%
responsible to help them carry out their
 
01:10:05.379 --> 01:10:05.389 align:start position:0%
jobs but we recognize that there are to
 
01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:08.150 align:start position:0%
be limits in a democratic society there
 
01:10:10.569 --> 01:10:10.579 align:start position:0%
are to be limits I don't believe that
 
01:10:15.819 --> 01:10:15.829 align:start position:0%
this bill does that but I understand
 
01:10:18.970 --> 01:10:18.980 align:start position:0%
that a lot of a lot of you do and that's
 
01:10:23.049 --> 01:10:23.059 align:start position:0%
fine I'm just saying that we ought to
 
01:10:25.479 --> 01:10:25.489 align:start position:0%
look at the language and we ought to
 
01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:30.170 align:start position:0%
look at the world around us and then
 
01:10:31.839 --> 01:10:31.849 align:start position:0%
make the decision that you feel
 
01:10:34.450 --> 01:10:34.460 align:start position:0%
comfortable with and you know those of
 
01:10:36.459 --> 01:10:36.469 align:start position:0%
you who know me for two years those of
 
01:10:38.770 --> 01:10:38.780 align:start position:0%
you who have known me for twenty know
 
01:10:43.839 --> 01:10:43.849 align:start position:0%
that I will respect and support whatever
 
01:10:47.799 --> 01:10:47.809 align:start position:0%
decision each of you makes and will
 
01:10:52.089 --> 01:10:52.099 align:start position:0%
honor the differences of opinion because
 
01:10:54.459 --> 01:10:54.469 align:start position:0%
these differences or what make it
 
01:10:57.879 --> 01:10:57.889 align:start position:0%
possible for us to weigh alternatives
 
01:10:59.649 --> 01:10:59.659 align:start position:0%
and try to come up with the best now
 
01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:02.420 align:start position:0%
someone accused me of lecturing when I
 
01:11:04.629 --> 01:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
did this at the end of the work session
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
I waited for an hour or more to hear
 
01:11:12.339 --> 01:11:12.349 align:start position:0%
everyone else I hope it's not lecturing
 
01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:15.230 align:start position:0%
when I take my chance to share my
 
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
thoughts with you and now I recognize
 
01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:27.150 align:start position:0%
we okay okay yeah thank you thank you
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
madam chair just one thing I would raise
 
01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:30.929 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to prolong this
 
01:11:33.649 --> 01:11:33.659 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily but I hope I understood
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
your comments correctly but seem to me
 
01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
in the examples that you gave the object
 
01:11:40.879 --> 01:11:40.889 align:start position:0%
of the game and those examples were
 
01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:43.110 align:start position:0%
simply simply to identify who the
 
01:11:46.069 --> 01:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
victims were and it didn't seem to me
 
01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
that the object of the game in those
 
01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:50.130 align:start position:0%
examples was to actually find a
 
01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:51.860 align:start position:0%
perpetrator and prosecute that person
 
01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
now you wouldn't normally bring an
 
01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:56.070 align:start position:0%
action in court where you'd have to have
 
01:11:58.459 --> 01:11:58.469 align:start position:0%
admissible evidence against a missing
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
child if you just identified the child
 
01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
and took it back to its parents but you
 
01:12:05.359 --> 01:12:05.369 align:start position:0%
would do it if you use that information
 
01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:08.610 align:start position:0%
to to prosecute somebody who causes the
 
01:12:11.859 --> 01:12:11.869 align:start position:0%
child to go missing and I think that's
 
01:12:14.359 --> 01:12:14.369 align:start position:0%
that's that's where this bill becomes
 
01:12:18.109 --> 01:12:18.119 align:start position:0%
problematic I I don't want to I just
 
01:12:20.689 --> 01:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
think we need to draw that distinction
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
and so that's it for me thanks thank you
 
01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
very much anybody else okay I think we
 
01:12:38.419 --> 01:12:38.429 align:start position:0%
have perhaps it was exhausted the
 
01:12:41.419 --> 01:12:41.429 align:start position:0%
discussion represented welfare has
 
01:12:49.399 --> 01:12:49.409 align:start position:0%
something he wants to add the adoption
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
of amendment 1255 representative well
 
01:13:00.439 --> 01:13:00.449 align:start position:0%
per has moved the adoption of 2020 12:55
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
h is there a second representative
 
01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:11.210 align:start position:0%
McGuire seconds the nomination
 
01:13:17.589 --> 01:13:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:22.070 align:start position:0%
woodies seconded the motion thank you is
 
01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:25.050 align:start position:0%
there any further discussion on the
 
01:13:25.050 --> 01:13:28.510 align:start position:0%
there any further discussion on the
motion

01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.970 --> 01:13:30.980 align:start position:0%
ordinarily if we were in the same room
 
01:13:35.209 --> 01:13:35.219 align:start position:0%
we would vote on an amendment by a show
 
01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:38.730 align:start position:0%
of hands but under the requirements that
 
01:13:42.169 --> 01:13:42.179 align:start position:0%
we face today because we are not in a
 
01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
room we must take a roll call vote so
 
01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:51.210 align:start position:0%
when the clerk is ready he will take a
 
01:13:56.209 --> 01:13:56.219 align:start position:0%
roll call vote on the motion to adopt
 
01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:09.570 align:start position:0%
12:55 H to House bill 1642 and we're
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
waiting for representative Weber to be
 
01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:16.050 align:start position:0%
heard ah now good there we go I have to
 
01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:23.550 align:start position:0%
go back to the other window okay so the
 
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
move is a doctrine of amendment one two
 
01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:30.980 align:start position:0%
five five representative Keynes yes
 
01:14:41.629 --> 01:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
representative birch no well perhaps you
 
01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:44.070 align:start position:0%
want to just do it the old-fashioned way
 
01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:47.750 align:start position:0%
on paper and then enter it with artwork
 
01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:51.090 align:start position:0%
um what it really takes is for me to to
 
01:14:52.459 --> 01:14:52.469 align:start position:0%
know how to enter it right and I'm doing
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
it solo okay this won't take much longer
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
at all representative Oregon no in the
 
01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:07.620 align:start position:0%

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:45.050 align:start position:0%
so you're all right now I'm sure I
 
01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:46.510 align:start position:0%
should have done it the other way
 
01:16:52.049 --> 01:16:52.059 align:start position:0%
why can't I just do it over you it's for
 
01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
now the clerk boats yes okay I know my
 
01:17:21.209 --> 01:17:21.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:28.350 --> 01:17:28.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:32.750 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin no forget how
 
01:17:38.730 --> 01:17:38.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:40.610 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
01:17:52.890 --> 01:17:52.900 align:start position:0%
yes representative Alexander no I'm sure
 
01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
yes that's right
 
01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:05.630 align:start position:0%
so the vote being nine in the
 
01:18:07.290 --> 01:18:07.300 align:start position:0%
affirmative eleven in the negative
 
01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:09.290 align:start position:0%
attending the negative with one not
 
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
attending the negative with one not
voting

01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:10.390 align:start position:0%
voting
 
01:18:17.290 --> 01:18:17.300 align:start position:0%
okay I have eight eleven did I eight
 
01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:32.230 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:41.370 align:start position:0%
the motion fails on amendment
 
01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:48.790 align:start position:0%
12:55 is there another uh excuse me
 
01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:50.290 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan did you or
 
01:18:53.490 --> 01:18:53.500 align:start position:0%
something that's actually a procedural
 
01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:57.070 align:start position:0%
question which this is probably I don't
 
01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:57.790 align:start position:0%
know whether I should have should have
 
01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:00.490 align:start position:0%
raised it now or after the vote but um
 
01:19:03.810 --> 01:19:03.820 align:start position:0%
so we refer to at least two emails we've
 
01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:06.850 align:start position:0%
received and those should be wooded
 
01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:09.430 align:start position:0%
under normal circumstances end up in the
 
01:19:11.610 --> 01:19:11.620 align:start position:0%
bill file and there were several other
 
01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:14.650 align:start position:0%
emails that we read and thought about so
 
01:19:18.330 --> 01:19:18.340 align:start position:0%
there so it's already means to make sure
 
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
that those are included in the file
 
01:19:23.790 --> 01:19:23.800 align:start position:0%
just because I'm sure sure I'm sure
 
01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:25.570 align:start position:0%
we'll have similar bills and future
 
01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:27.190 align:start position:0%
sessions to people will want to go back
 
01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:29.770 align:start position:0%
and look at the record of what well
 
01:19:32.130 --> 01:19:32.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question under under
 
01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:35.550 align:start position:0%
house rules and I have not seen any
 
01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:37.630 align:start position:0%
indication that these house rules have
 
01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:44.290 align:start position:0%
changed bills that are I mean excuse me
 
01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:50.650 align:start position:0%
emails that are received do not have to
 
01:19:54.330 --> 01:19:54.340 align:start position:0%
be put in the permanent record in order
 
01:19:57.390 --> 01:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
to go into the permanent record
 
01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:00.730 align:start position:0%
they are either hand-delivered which
 
01:20:02.970 --> 01:20:02.980 align:start position:0%
cannot happen under this circumstance or
 
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
sent by mail and that is that is what
 
01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:14.710 align:start position:0%
exists under house rules
 
01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:20.430 align:start position:0%
I hear the point that you are making and
 
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
I am going to leave that to the staff to
 
01:20:32.930 --> 01:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
