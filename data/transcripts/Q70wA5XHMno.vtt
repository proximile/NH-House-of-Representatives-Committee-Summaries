your

00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:33.639 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
motion um yes I think that the uh the
 
00:12:40.279 --> 00:12:41.829 align:start position:0%
motion um yes I think that the uh the
prime

00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:41.839 align:start position:0%
prime
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor would like the uh State of New
 
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to not be uh a Dylan's rural
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
State and essentially uh trying to uh
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
put in the Constitution that they that
 
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
the local municipalities are um in
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
charge of of zoning um and the in the
 
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
state the conquered conquered actually
 
00:13:14.829 --> 00:13:14.839 align:start position:0%
grants uh municipalities what they can
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
and cannot do with
 
00:13:22.189 --> 00:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
zoning and the uh the language I believe
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
is UN
 
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
unworkable it's uh complicated as far as
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
it says that
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
um municipalities should have ultimate
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
power but then it dictates what they
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
should and should not do as far as um
 
00:13:40.829 --> 00:13:40.839 align:start position:0%
variances and stuff like that and so um
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:48.519 align:start position:0%
of not clear as far as what what it
 
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
actually wants to do um as far as do
 
00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:53.759 align:start position:0%
they have ultimate control or do they
 
00:13:58.269 --> 00:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
not um and so for those reasons I will
 
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
not be able to support uh cacr 16 thank
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
you thank representative Brown do you
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
have something I your mic's still on
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
okay um representative majori I saw your
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
hand thank you Mr chairman I I agree
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
with the previous speaker about this and
 
00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
would be supporting uh the itl I I
 
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
wondered if the idea of the bill was to
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
create the kind of transparency or
 
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
create a a lot of
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
transparency in in local government but
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
I cannot see how this language would
 
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
effectuate those ends and I actually
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
think it would make it more complicated
 
00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519 align:start position:0%
to provide the kind of honesty and and
 
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
and and all of the facts with this
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
language I just think it would be too
 
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
honorous and and too much of a problem
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
so I'll be supporting the
 
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
itl thank you representative PRI thank
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I will also be
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
supporting the itl motion and I agree
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
with the um statements that my the
 
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
fellow repres my fellow Representatives
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
have made so far and I would even go as
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
far as to say this would be a nightmare
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
to implement in the localities um
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
especially the fiscal impacts of
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
everything that comes up in the
 
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
communities I just don't think that's
 
00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:21.279 align:start position:0%

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative priest
 
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
would you like to
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
speak uh thank you Mr chairman uh this
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
bill does not needed at this particular
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
time uh we received t a lot of testimony
 
00:17:59.710 --> 00:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
against the bill plus the emails
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
against that I also question uh that
 
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
Authority Under
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
RSA 105 2-a the authority of the police
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
chief to uh if I can just find it here
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
shall the authority to direct to control
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
all employees of his or her Department
 
00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
in the normal course of Duty and I think
 
00:18:20.149 --> 00:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
this bill would contradict that current
 
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
RSA for the authority of the uh the
 
00:18:24.149 --> 00:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
chief of police of the community that
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
they serve thank
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
you further comments representative
 
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
lales thank you Mr chairman
 
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
um I think this is a well-meaning
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
bill uh the problem as I see it is
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
that here in New Hampshire
 
00:18:50.149 --> 00:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
currently the use of First
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
Responders is really Under Pressure so
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
this is not a good time to be messing
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
around with uh this sort of uh enactment
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
so I'll be voting for The
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
PRI thank you Mr chairman I will also be
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
voting for the
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
itl um I think as it's been stated so
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
far that this process is
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
already in in the in the regulations for
 
00:19:25.919 --> 00:19:26.870 align:start position:0%
already in in the in the regulations for
local

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
communities and with de
 
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman I I would
 
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
also concur with my colleagues on the
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee that um while this bill may be
 
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned that there are
 
00:19:53.149 --> 00:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
concerns in that um the chief of police
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
has the responsibility to ensure and
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
oversee the safety of the travel in
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
public on roadways and I did have a
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
lengthy conversation I asked a lot of
 
00:20:07.149 --> 00:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
questions of my police chief in the town
 
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
in which I reside and he explained the
 
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
process to me and it was very clear that
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
when there's work to be done the
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
contractor will contact the chief of
 
00:20:21.549 --> 00:20:21.559 align:start position:0%
police and a lot of questions will be um
 
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
asked and the situation at hand with
 
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
regards to the work will be
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
analyzed lots of factors are taken into
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
account the location of where the work
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
will be conducted the nature of the
 
00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:41.559 align:start position:0%
work um as well as the type of of
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
roadway and the police
 
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
chief working in the town has that that
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge as to the type of Road the
 
00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559 align:start position:0%
traffic um impacts the time of day so
 
00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
therefore I I don't see
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
it it concerns me greatly that this bill
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
would take that oversight away from um
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
the person in the municipality who is
 
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
charged with um ensuring the public
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
safety so for those reasons I will be
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
supporting the itl thank you
 
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.630 align:start position:0%

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly will be supporting the
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
itl we we um we saw overwhelming
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
testimony from from online and with
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
phone calls and with people coming to
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
our committee about why we shouldn't go
 
00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
forward with this with this bill and and
 
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we're trusted
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
with as members of this legislative body
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
is protecting the public and we need to
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
make sure that the people that can do
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
that the best are providing safety for
 
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
our for our people for that reason um
 
00:21:55.149 --> 00:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
itl representative Gallagher um so so
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to note that the uh
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
previous time our committee held
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
executive session on this bill before um
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
it was recommitted to us we passed it
 
00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
otpa 18 to1 uh it seemed to be a pretty
 
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
strong agreement that it was a good idea
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
then and basically what's changed is
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
since then is that the police have gone
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
mad and have bullied us out of
 
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
supporting us and as someone who um took
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
part in the uh in the protests against
 
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
police brutality and police power in
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
2020 uh I'm not going to be bullied
 
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
around like that so um I'm going
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
to uh stick with my previous vote on
 
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
this bill and
 
00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:53.919 align:start position:0%
um oppose the itl motion on
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.070 align:start position:0%

seeing none I I will just speak briefly
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
to it I I I understand this is going to
 
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
go nowhere in the committee which is
 
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
fine but um I do want to comment on a
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
few things uh the first thing is I I too

chief of police and explained or asked
 
00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
them to explain the how they actually go
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
about um Del uh giving Authority to the
 
00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:30.919 align:start position:0%
chiefs of police now it may be different
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
in the big cities I'm not aware and
 
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
those are the only individuals we
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
actually heard from were uh City uh
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
individuals in fact when I asked one of
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
ncpa I asked him if he had spoken to
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
anybody in the small commit uh
 
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
communities and they he said they hadn't
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
um anyway the way it works in um the
 
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
town of
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
barington is and it's always been this
 
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
way is that the chief of police does
 
00:24:03.549 --> 00:24:03.559 align:start position:0%
make the decision the chief of police
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
though is subordinate to the town
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
manager who is also subordinate to the
 
00:24:13.149 --> 00:24:13.159 align:start position:0%
uh select the select board so there is a
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
chain of command there um the I think
 
00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
the original sponsors representative
 
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
Bickford's original intent was to
 
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
basically put into the
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
rsa's um
 
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
to give guidance to the towns that were
 
00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
un unsure of how it should work um we
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
had one individual who actually made the
 
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.389 align:start position:0%
had one individual who actually made the
comment

00:24:39.389 --> 00:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
that would this require him to re
 
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
convene the board of Selectmen every
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
time they wanted
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
a a police deal detail well that's I
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
mean simply silly I mean that this
 
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do that um the other big thing
 
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
is the deal T regulations actually
 
00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.350 align:start position:0%
is the deal T regulations actually
speak

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
to um other than class four or five
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
roads the CL the New Hampshire dot
 
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
Flagger requirements actually are for um
 
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
the dot which operates on anything but
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
class four or five roads it does however
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
say when they oversee class four five
 
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
roads then they should uh look at the uh
 
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
get a separate Municipal agreement blah
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
blah blah the point is that again I
 
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
think this was more of a clarifying type
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
of Bill rather than a changing of the
 
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines um I too will support it only
 
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.230 align:start position:0%
guidelines um I too will support it only
because

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
uh my name's on the
 
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
amendment with along with representative
 
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
Bickford um I I totally understand the
 
00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee's uh r against it
 
00:26:01.789 --> 00:26:01.799 align:start position:0%
we'll accept that representative kill
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
you have something else yeah thank you
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I just I just wanted to speak
 
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
to the reason why we um when we have
 
00:26:10.389 --> 00:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
these bills involving law enforcement
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
why we see big city um departments
 
00:26:15.789 --> 00:26:15.799 align:start position:0%
represented well it's because these
 
00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
small departments don't have the staff
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
to send people to come here um we did
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
have a member of the Hamstead Police
 
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:23.480 align:start position:0%
Department testify at our last hearing
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
and they're a very small Department um
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
but in most cases they don't have the
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
staff to send someone down here to
 
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
represent the Departments
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
and that's why I think that
 
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
happens further comments questions
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:48.029 --> 00:26:48.039 align:start position:0%

1053 relative to permissible residential
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
units in a commercial Zone do we have a
 
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
motion representative priest I see your
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%

we
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:59.070 --> 00:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
1053 I
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
will representative Gilman second sorry
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative major she beat you to it
 
00:30:06.669 --> 00:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
uh representative priest would you like
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
to speak to
 
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
this Mike you you flipped it the other
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
way I'm sorry Mr chairman thank you um
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have local control
 
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
and this bill would be taking away that
 
00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.149 align:start position:0%
and this bill would be taking away that
uh

00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility communities right now
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
have the option to Zone known portions
 
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
of their communities as mix use
 
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
communities both commercial and
 
00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
residential and many communities have
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
done this so it's already in it's
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
already in the process second there
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
would be unintended consequences if we
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
mandated that all commercial zones be
 
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
allow residential
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
uses um as I was re talking to one of my
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
fellow repres resentatives today
 
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh has this kind of mixed
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
zoning and as soon as the residential
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
came into their building they left and
 
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
so we now have a vacancy where a very
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
strong business was once and and no
 
00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
longer is so there are reasons why we
 
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
have commercial districts and why
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
residential isn't a part of it and I
 
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
think that should be kept to local
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
control and their planning boards and
 
00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
their Selectmen to make sure that that
 
00:31:36.029 --> 00:31:36.039 align:start position:0%
is appropriate use for those areas thank
 
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
comments representative Gallagher I'll
 
00:31:46.269 --> 00:31:46.279 align:start position:0%
be opposing the itl motion on this um I
 
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
think we need a house or we have a
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
housing crisis right now we need to um
 
00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
loosen zoning restrictions to make it
 
00:31:58.509 --> 00:31:58.519 align:start position:0%
easier to build new housing or to allow
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
people to occupy existing structures if
 
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
you've got a business leading leaving
 
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
then fine that's just more room for
 
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
housing we need housing more than we
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
need businesses right now um so um yeah
 
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good bill idea um as
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
far as it uh taking away local control
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
good um the thing is local control
 
00:32:22.629 --> 00:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
basically allows nimes to stop housing
 
00:32:25.149 --> 00:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
projects and we've seen it abused time
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
and time again to make this housing
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
crisis worse the whole principle of loal
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
control were working fine we would not
 
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
be in this housing crisis that we're in
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
right now so we we need
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
to we we need to stop being inthrall to
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
that principle and need to try some new
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
approaches um this bill would be a one
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
of those good new approaches um and I
 
00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:59.789 --> 00:32:59.799 align:start position:0%
try representative
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
majority oh you're up thank you Mr
 
00:33:05.789 --> 00:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
chairman um I will be supporting the uh
 
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
the itl on this although I do think the
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
bill um I do think the intent behind the
 
00:33:12.909 --> 00:33:12.919 align:start position:0%
bill was was very good but as as my
 
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
friend who made the motion said I I
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
think we will have I think that there
 
00:33:18.669 --> 00:33:18.679 align:start position:0%
will be unattended consequences with
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
having issues where you have a
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
commercial Zone that suddenly now you're
 
00:33:25.789 --> 00:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
going to have to put a round peg into a
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
square hole when it comes to that kind a
 
00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
zoning if if the the bill says that
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
building now shall have no more stricter
 
00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
regulations than it would for a
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
residential you're going to you're not
 
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
only going to have a mixed use you're
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
going to have mixed zoning and mixed
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
regulations I I think you're going to
 
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
create a problem if you have an A an
 
00:33:51.549 --> 00:33:51.559 align:start position:0%
application coming in for mixed use then
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
then you have an issue where you can
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
look at this comprehensively but if
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do it peace meal while
 
00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
I agree that affordable housing finding
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
more affordable housing is important and
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
this might get us there I think this
 
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
bill will have more problems then it
 
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
you representative kahill thank you Mr
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
chair I I I think my colleague
 
00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
representative majori eloquently said
 
00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
that and I agree with everything you
 
00:34:22.109 --> 00:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
just said and you know to the point of
 
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
local control local control is what got
 
00:34:26.589 --> 00:34:26.599 align:start position:0%
each one of us representing our people
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
here today I mean they they put us here
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
um you know so local control isn't all
 
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.310 align:start position:0%
um you know so local control isn't all
that

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
bad for the comments representative
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
Gilman I'm sorry supposed to call you n
 
00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chair um with all
 
00:34:45.149 --> 00:34:45.159 align:start position:0%
respect to my uh colleague uh
 
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher I agree that we
 
00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:50.839 align:start position:0%
need to use all the tools we can for uh
 
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
increasing our housing our housing stock
 
00:34:56.390 --> 00:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
a diverse housing stock um however this
 
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
is uh time and time again we hear um
 
00:35:04.109 --> 00:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
mandated zoning doesn't work for every
 
00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:06.599 align:start position:0%
town you know my town has 15,000 people
 
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:09.640 align:start position:0%
in it one town has 800 they might not
 
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
have the opportunities that we do and if
 
00:35:14.589 --> 00:35:14.599 align:start position:0%
we tell them they have to do this um it
 
00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
it just might not work and then there
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
will be lawsuits and you know the
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences that my other uh
 
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
colleagues have spoken of uh so I will
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
be supporting an itl in this Bill thank
 
00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.829 align:start position:0%
be supporting an itl in this Bill thank
you

00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie thank you Mr
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
chairman I would like to say that uh the
 
00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
housing shortage so-called housing
 
00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
shortage is used as a disguise sometimes
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
to interfere with local zoning I think
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
local zoning is local for a reason I
 
00:35:50.829 --> 00:35:50.839 align:start position:0%
think the the particularly when you have
 
00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
a legislation that say shell a matter of
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
right uh I don't think that's uh the
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
States uh business uh each town is
 
00:36:04.349 --> 00:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
different uh the cities certainly are
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
different than the towns and the thing
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
say that the the same shoe will fit all
 
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
feet is is just just doesn't make sense
 
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:15.640 align:start position:0%
to me and I will be voting against I'm
 
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
sorry in favor of the
 
00:36:21.069 --> 00:36:21.079 align:start position:0%
itl further
 
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none I'll make two quick
 
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
ones uh I can't I can say I don't think
 
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
I've ever been in more agreement than
 
00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
with representative priests than uh than
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:36:33.839 --> 00:36:35.990 align:start position:0%
right now
um

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:39.069 --> 00:36:39.079 align:start position:0%
uh anytime I see a bill that says As a
 
00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
matter of right which compels top down
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
zoning um I I I'm against I mean it's
 
00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
just something that that I'm not willing
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
to do um the the one thing that I asked
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh Ben Frost of New Hampshire housing um
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
at the end and I I think I asked home
 
00:36:59.470 --> 00:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
almost every time when we have one of
 
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
these matter of right
 
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
bills and that
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
was absent this bill can the local towns
 
00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.589 align:start position:0%
was absent this bill can the local towns
and

00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:10.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities change their zoning to
 
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
accommodate this because we know many of
 
00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
them already do this and he of course
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
smiled and said yes so the towns have
 
00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
the ability to do the municipalities
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do this now if they
 
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
wish and I local control is where where
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
we need to keep it for the
 
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none we'll ask the clerk
 
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:34.760 align:start position:0%

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:29.990 align:start position:0%
on House Bill

1101 do we have a second on that
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
representative PRI representative majori
 
00:40:38.589 --> 00:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak yes thank you Mr
 
00:40:38.599 --> 00:40:40.510 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak yes thank you Mr
chairman

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
um while there may be some R well there
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
may be some reluctancy I'm a little
 
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
tired too I guess um to create
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
additional study committees if there is
 
00:40:53.309 --> 00:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
the energy and the passion to go ahead
 
00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
and do this I think the cause is worthy
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
um um anytime that we can
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
address the affordable housing which
 
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
this bill tries to do and tries to look
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
at what we could do for Relief on
 
00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
student loans um I think this is I think
 
00:41:15.309 --> 00:41:15.319 align:start position:0%
this is an enormous bite out of the
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
Apple um but I would love to see the the
 
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
steps to to address both of these
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
situations uh and if there is the uh if
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
we do have the people who are willing to
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
sit on that commit and undertake this
 
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
worthy effort I think they should be
 
00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
you further comments representative
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
priest did you have a hand up yes thank
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I will also be
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
supporting the OTP on this bill um even
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
though I there even though there are
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
existing programs in New Hampshire such
 
00:41:58.829 --> 00:41:58.839 align:start position:0%
as um the neighbor Works Southern
 
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
neighbor works of Southern New Hampshire
 
00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:03.160 align:start position:0%
and the New Hampshire Housing Finance
 
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
Authority that do exactly what this bill
 
00:42:11.309 --> 00:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
does for the housing component of it I
 
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
believe that a study committee to look
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
into other means of helping to
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
finance um affordable housing as well as
 
00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
to address the um the
 
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
burdensome of student loans and how we
 
00:42:34.349 --> 00:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
lalis yes um thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:46.559 align:start position:0%
anytime I see something like student
 
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
loans lopped in with a
 
00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.750 align:start position:0%
loans lopped in with a
housing

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:42:58.349 --> 00:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
issue I'm reminded of the high school
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
graduate who went to a trade school and
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
then mortgaged everything he had to buy
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
a construction
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle and he
 
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
he's in loans up to his eyeballs so that
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
he can make a
 
00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
living I I just look at the
 
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
unfairness of a person who legally
 
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
obligates them themselves to acquire a a
 
00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:32.870 align:start position:0%
obligates them themselves to acquire a a
college

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
college
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
education which does not provide
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
enough uh monetary Advantage for them to
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
pay back their student loans I cannot
 
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
support anything that lumps those two
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
things together so I will be voting
 
00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
against this thank
 
00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
you represent kill thank you Mr chair um
 
00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
you know while I agree
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
with we have issues and problems that we
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
need to solve there's already a great
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
program that solves both of these issues
 
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
at the same time um and that would be
 
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
the US Army or the US Air Force where
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
you could get affordable housing and get
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
your student loans and get paid to have
 
00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
a job at the same time um so there there
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
are options already out there uh you
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
departments representative Gilman thank
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh I support this um this
 
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
bill because of the uh testimony that we
 
00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:39.559 align:start position:0%
received about people having to make a
 
00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
choice over uh paying for their housing
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
or paying off their student loans at a
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
which um tend to be at a higher rate of
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:57.069 --> 00:44:57.079 align:start position:0%
also uh yeah both of which hinder having
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
savings to to um make other choices like
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
buying new vehicles for the construction
 
00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
business this doesn't say anywhere that
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's only for student loans for colleges
 
00:45:09.549 --> 00:45:09.559 align:start position:0%
there also is money required for trade
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
schools and to your point uh
 
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:13.720 align:start position:0%
representative of this solutions of
 
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
joining the armed services there's also
 
00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
evidence that people living on uh armed
 
00:45:24.109 --> 00:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
services wages are still getting uh food
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
stamps and other support from public
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
services so I think that an interim
 
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
study to make sure that this is a smooth
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
and uh um
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate um makeup of the Loan
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
program uh whether together or
 
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:43.720 align:start position:0%
separately uh is a is an appropriate
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
thing to do right now to to go along
 
00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
with the housing bills and and the other
 
00:45:50.829 --> 00:45:50.839 align:start position:0%
affordability bills that we have coming
 
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
up so I will be voting to support this
 
00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.910 align:start position:0%
up so I will be voting to support this
thank

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
you for the uh representative Guthrie do
 
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:01.240 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up thank you Mr
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
chairman I also would be concerned about
 
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
combining uh uh low uh rent uh interest
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
in income interest loans for the uh uh
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
education for for for combining the two
 
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
of them I don't think they're compatible
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh I think that both subjects could be
 
00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
overwhelming and maybe if it was broken
 
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
up as a separate bill I would have more
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh sympathy for it but I really can't uh
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
support a bill that that comb combines
 
00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
these two it just doesn't seem a a way
 
00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.430 align:start position:0%
these two it just doesn't seem a a way
to

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
go uh representative haret
 
00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
gas thank you Mr chair
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
um I don't really look at this as a bill
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
this is requesting a committee that
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
people take a look at this I don't think
 
00:46:59.549 --> 00:46:59.559 align:start position:0%
that um us sitting around the table
 
00:47:01.549 --> 00:47:01.559 align:start position:0%
really can answer for this either
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
whether it's the loan for um college or
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
whether it's um a
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
mortgage I don't see that as being out
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
function right now but I do believe a
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
committee it it would help if a
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
committee could be available to take a
 
00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
look at those things and if it doesn't
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
work out fine but this is an opportunity
 
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
to do something for people that really
 
00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:22.349 align:start position:0%
to do something for people that really
need

00:47:22.349 --> 00:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none I'll add a quick
 
00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:32.839 align:start position:0%
two cents here um
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
as somebody mentioned there already many
 
00:47:40.349 --> 00:47:40.359 align:start position:0%
programs that exist to cover these two
 
00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
issues um one not mentioned is basically
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
debt consolidation companies that exist
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
for this kind of thing uh my general
 
00:47:52.109 --> 00:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
problem with it I I I will be voting
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
against the motion and that is the
 
00:47:57.549 --> 00:47:57.559 align:start position:0%
establishing of yet another
 
00:47:57.559 --> 00:47:59.190 align:start position:0%
establishing of yet another
committee

00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
um as representative majori mentioned if
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
we can find people willing to sit on it
 
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
well I I see nine individual or is it
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
maybe 10 that are
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the bill I'm
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
always I always wonder why not the
 
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
individuals who are the sponsors
 
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
actually do the research and come
 
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
forward with a bill to actually make
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
this happen what they want to see happen
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
and rather than passing the uh
 
00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility to you know to somebody
 
00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:34.630 align:start position:0%
responsibility to you know to somebody
else

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
um to me that would be the the better
 
00:48:41.069 --> 00:48:41.079 align:start position:0%
way to handle this um again uh study
 
00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
commissions study committees
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
um we have several hundred right now in
 
00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
the house and most of them never even
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
meet or accomplish anything so I just on
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
that alone I'll be against
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
this further comments
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
represent Gilman thank you Mr chair um I
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
did neglect to to point out that this
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
was uh to establish a committee to study
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
the potential of doing these of
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
combining these things or making them
 
00:49:14.109 --> 00:49:14.119 align:start position:0%
separate um and I know that we have many
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
um committees and commissions that have
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
been ineffective or have not met um but
 
00:49:21.549 --> 00:49:21.559 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
committee to study the Committees and
 
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
commissions and cut that out this is one
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
I think has been a topic for a number of
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
years and has a uh a purpose that we've
 
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
been talking about more and more this
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
year um how to make things affordable
 
00:49:41.309 --> 00:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
for the people of New Hampshire uh so I
 
00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.079 align:start position:0%

add representative
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
kill I do I I think
 
00:51:45.549 --> 00:51:45.559 align:start position:0%
that these ideas separate could have
 
00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
been something that um there could have
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
been more compromise on looking at if
 
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
these two issues were separate um but
 
00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:54.440 align:start position:0%
because they're together I think there's
 
00:51:58.109 --> 00:51:58.119 align:start position:0%
some some dangerous complications there
 
00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:01.720 align:start position:0%
so for the comments I see none
 
00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:04.799 align:start position:0%
representative PRI I agree with my
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
fellow representative uh K Hill on this
 
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
um that it would be advisable to
 
00:52:14.789 --> 00:52:14.799 align:start position:0%
separate both of these issues into two
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
committees uh because of the
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
complexities of them but I will be
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%

the elderly property tax exemption and
 
00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
we will look to representative yok Kella
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
for a
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
motion I move
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
itl do we have a second I second that Mr
 
00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
chairman representative Brown seconds
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative yella would you like to
 
00:55:54.829 --> 00:55:54.839 align:start position:0%
speak sure um the sponsor of this bill
 
00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
indicated that he was just trying to
 
00:56:00.789 --> 00:56:00.799 align:start position:0%
raise it um the
 
00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:05.720 align:start position:0%
minimum because of inflation however
 
00:56:07.789 --> 00:56:07.799 align:start position:0%
municipalities already have the option
 
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
to raise ITC for whatever reason
 
00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:13.160 align:start position:0%
inflation or just because they want to
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
um give more relief so I think that this
 
00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.630 align:start position:0%
um give more relief so I think that this
is

00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:19.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:56:23.789 --> 00:56:23.799 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um and if those if the
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
communities that are currently at the
 
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
minimum um want to stay there I'm not
 
00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:31.240 align:start position:0%
sure that that we should be forcing them
 
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
to increase that um requirement so for
 
00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
those reasons I think that uh this bill
 
00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
needed further comments representative
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
major thank you Mr chairman um I agree
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh with the comments that were just said
 
00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:52.119 align:start position:0%
um it would be great if we could have a
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
bill that had a trigger in it that
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
anytime you know that anytime inflation
 
00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
went up or or we could raise these
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
things to some to some uh index uh but
 
00:57:04.829 --> 00:57:04.839 align:start position:0%
the communities have that responsibility
 
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:06.440 align:start position:0%
they have that Authority they have that
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
flexibility to do that and I think that
 
00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
should stay there if that was the only
 
00:57:11.789 --> 00:57:11.799 align:start position:0%
thing happening in this bill I think we
 
00:57:13.789 --> 00:57:13.799 align:start position:0%
might even be able to have a deeper
 
00:57:15.789 --> 00:57:15.799 align:start position:0%
conversation but it goes even further
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
than that and I think that the new
 
00:57:22.349 --> 00:57:22.359 align:start position:0%
definitions open up another can of worms
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
uh or open up additional cans of worms
 
00:57:27.549 --> 00:57:27.559 align:start position:0%
that may again have unint consequences
 
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
and um so I I get where the sponsor
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
wants to go to give relief to uh to this
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
group of individuals but I think this
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
bill will cause problems thank
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
you thank you further comments
 
00:57:41.599 --> 00:57:43.069 align:start position:0%
you thank you further comments
representative

00:57:43.069 --> 00:57:43.079 align:start position:0%

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
gri thank you Mr chairman these this
 
00:57:50.069 --> 00:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
issue was taken up at the local level
 
00:57:53.309 --> 00:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
with a warrant article so every town has
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
a chance to vote on whether or not they
 
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
want to in increase the uh items in
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
curan elderly exemption so I feel more
 
00:58:05.549 --> 00:58:05.559 align:start position:0%
comfortable having it handle at the
 
00:58:07.549 --> 00:58:07.559 align:start position:0%
local level particularly where it has to
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
go through an a waren article means that
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
the towns towns people have a chance to
 
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
vote on it so uh I don't think this is
 
00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
necessary and I'll uh support
 
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.240 align:start position:0%

power thank you Mr chairman um the
 
01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:18.839 align:start position:0%
official ballot referendum form of town
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
meeting commonly known as SP2 was signed
 
01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:27.640 align:start position:0%
into law in 1995 that's 30 years ago
 
01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:29.720 align:start position:0%
and from
 
01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:33.160 align:start position:0%
1995 up until
 
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
2019 Based on data on um that I was able
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
to obtain on the um Dr website
 
01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:45.160 align:start position:0%
152 political subdivisions have adopted
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
theb2 form of town
 
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
meeting now in
 
01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:53.319 align:start position:0%
2019 the statute was well let me just
 
01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
back up so just just to be clear um the
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
question to adopt the SP2 form of town
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
meeting when this was signed into
 
01:02:08.269 --> 01:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
law the question was placed on the
 
01:02:11.309 --> 01:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
official ballot which meant that voters
 
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
were able to vote upon that
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
question on on Election Day at the polls
 
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
in the privacy of the the um the voting
 
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.829 align:start position:0%
in the privacy of the the um the voting
booths

01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
booths
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
to be clear changing from a
 
01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
traditional um form of town meeting to
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
SP2 is is a serious
 
01:02:41.309 --> 01:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
consideration and therefore it it it's
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon the political subdivision
 
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
to have as many people weighing in on
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
that decision so um back to
 
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
2019 there was a bill introduced that
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
was signed into law which removed the
 
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
question to adopt sb2 from the official
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
ballot and instead to have that question
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
to be voted upon at the traditional Town
 
01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:09.950 align:start position:0%
to be voted upon at the traditional Town
town

01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
meeting so since that
 
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
time starting in
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
2020 there have been a total of 31 um
 
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
attempts to pass
 
01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
SP2 and
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
30 of those have failed and only
 
01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
one has been successful in making that
 
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
change so we should just really look at
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
that and and ask ourself you know what's
 
01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:41.990 align:start position:0%
that and and ask ourself you know what's
going

01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
on when for 30
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
years these questions have been placed
 
01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
on the official ballot and
 
01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.910 align:start position:0%
on the official ballot and
152

01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
152
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
um attempts were in fact
 
01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
and it makes no sense to me um as to why
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
this statute was changed and furthermore
 
01:04:09.549 --> 01:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
it is illogical to
 
01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
me that whether or not you agree with
 
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
SP2 that's a separate issue some people
 
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
like it some people don't there's pluses
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
and there's minuses that's not the issue
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
at hand the issue at hand is the method
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
by which the question to ad where where
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
was that placed is it on the official
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
ballot like it had been from the
 
01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:31.549 align:start position:0%
ballot like it had been from the
beginning

01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
or since or
 
01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
do or should it be as as it is um to be
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
voted upon at the traditional town
 
01:04:44.829 --> 01:04:44.839 align:start position:0%
meeting then and there simply by a a
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
card vote I would say that that that
 
01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
that's problematic because it makes no
 
01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
sense that a person has to go to a
 
01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
meeting that they really can't go to to
 
01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
say that we don't want to go to the
 
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
meeting we want to we want to be able to
 
01:05:06.029 --> 01:05:06.039 align:start position:0%
vote on warrant
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
articles on Election Day on Town
 
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
election day on the official ballot so
 
01:05:15.269 --> 01:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
for those reasons um I would ask the
 
01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
committee to support the motion of a to
 
01:05:21.069 --> 01:05:21.079 align:start position:0%
pass thank
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
you representative majority thank you Mr
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
yes in 2019 um I was going to say we but
 
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
this body Municipal and County uh had
 
01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
this bill uh it passed Municipal and
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
County by a vote of 18
 
01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:42.839 align:start position:0%
to1 um it passed in the house on the
 
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
floor by a vote of 235 to 122 and then
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
it passed in the Senate on a Voice vote
 
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
before it was signed into law um clearly
 
01:05:57.069 --> 01:05:57.079 align:start position:0%
the our colleagues on uh our our
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
colleagues our colleagues on the other
 
01:06:00.109 --> 01:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
side of the wall and the governor all
 
01:06:04.029 --> 01:06:04.039 align:start position:0%
supported uh the idea of of the current
 
01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
statute that we have now uh I would also
 
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
say that um when we look at the folks
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
who want to to change when we look at
 
01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:16.839 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill this is an
 
01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have a discussion about
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
how you want your Ballot or how you want
 
01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
to vote in your town continue to do it
 
01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
that way um I don't see how putting it
 
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
on the ballot is going to uh Empower any
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
more people and when I look at the
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
number of Warrant articles that have
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
failed I also wonder I think people like
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
the current situation or the current
 
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
conditions the way they are so by the
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
very fact that this body the body on the
 
01:06:46.029 --> 01:06:46.039 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall the governor all
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
supported what we have currently the
 
01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
fact that so many bills have failed to
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
change it I think that um the bill
 
01:06:56.269 --> 01:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
should be rather than OTP
 
01:07:00.589 --> 01:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much further
 
01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
comments representative y
 
01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
Kell thank you I do I do believe that
 
01:07:08.829 --> 01:07:08.839 align:start position:0%
there are some people that are
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised by this method of
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
choosing people that are not able to
 
01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:17.799 align:start position:0%
attend of a
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
prolonged uh town meeting and um people
 
01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
that are out of the state at the time of
 
01:07:29.549 --> 01:07:29.559 align:start position:0%
the meeting people that are um overseas
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
at the time of the meeting all of those
 
01:07:33.390 --> 01:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
people are disenfranchised from being
 
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
able because there is no absentee ballot
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
process in the town meeting style um of
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
of meeting all those people that would
 
01:07:45.839 --> 01:07:47.150 align:start position:0%
of meeting all those people that would
utilize

01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
utilize
 
01:07:50.789 --> 01:07:50.799 align:start position:0%
absentees uh ballots are disenfranchised
 
01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:54.200 align:start position:0%
from this taking part in that vote and
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
also um I think
 
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
that I think both sides are are are
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
referencing the number of times that
 
01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
people um vote on this issue in a
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
municipality before it gets adopted and
 
01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
I don't think that um I think that in my
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
municipality um we voted on it I think
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
six times before we adopted it and
 
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
that's because it is a significant
 
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
change and there is a little bit of a
 
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
learning curve about what it actually
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
means and what it actually entails and
 
01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:31.030 align:start position:0%
means and what it actually entails and
um

01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
in but but just because it took six
 
01:08:37.749 --> 01:08:37.759 align:start position:0%
times to pass in my municipality or
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
thereabouts um it it has been completely
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
embraced since then and there's not a uh
 
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:48.799 align:start position:0%
not a chance that we would be going back
 
01:08:52.269 --> 01:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
to the the the traditional town
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
meeting uh way um even with the some
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
drawbacks that I do see and I keep on
 
01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
bringing up about the Min the default
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
budget being an issue um I think that
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
you know even with that problem in the
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
sb2 formor I think it's a net benefit um
 
01:09:17.669 --> 01:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
to those people
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
that um don't want to or not able to to
 
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
spend prolonged amount of time at at the
 
01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:26.510 align:start position:0%
spend prolonged amount of time at at the
town

01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:28.759 align:start position:0%
meeting thank
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
Elwood thank you Mr chairman um I'm
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
originally from Washington DC and moved
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire in
 
01:09:43.829 --> 01:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
2006 I attended um the first town
 
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
meeting uh and was
 
01:09:50.110 --> 01:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
shocked I was shocked by the
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
behavior um of the you know moderator
 
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
who had no control
 
01:09:59.550 --> 01:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
people's right to free speech was
 
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
trampled um there was Acts of
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
intimidation and afterwards I asked
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
numerous people why they didn't attend
 
01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
and they simply
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
said because they would be retaliated
 
01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
against and um this this sent me into
 
01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.270 align:start position:0%
against and um this this sent me into
the

01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
stratosphere as to trying to
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
understand how this form of government
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh was Democratic at all so I I support
 
01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:33.870 align:start position:0%
uh was Democratic at all so I I support
the

01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
OTP further comments representative
 
01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman I I I would
 
01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
like to just add three more points here
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
the first point being that the
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
legislature was different the
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
composition of the legislature was
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
different than it is today back in 2019
 
01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
when this bill
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
um to
 
01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
change the question to adopt being on
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
the official ballot it's different so
 
01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
that we can't really um to me that's not
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
a valid argument secondly um again I'd
 
01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
like to reiterate this is an important
 
01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.110 align:start position:0%
like to reiterate this is an important
um

01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
decision for these political
 
01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
therefore when we have greater
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
participation in in in making this
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
decision that is that occurs by having
 
01:11:31.390 --> 01:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
the question on the official ballot and
 
01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
people can vote on it on Election Day I
 
01:11:39.149 --> 01:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
would I think that most people can agree
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
if you're intellectually honest that we
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
have a better outcome and a better you
 
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
know assessment as to whether a
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
political subdivision subdivision wants
 
01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
this change or not when we have more
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
people casting their votes
 
01:11:58.030 --> 01:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
and the last thing that I would um point
 
01:12:03.790 --> 01:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
out is curiously in 2019 when a bill was
 
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
passed to change this for some unknown
 
01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
reason the bill failed to also change
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
the question to rescind and pull that
 
01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
place it you know remove it from the
 
01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:20.679 align:start position:0%
official ballot and put it back in the
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
town meeting
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 1175
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
restores the Equitable standards to
 
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
adopt as well as to resend and I think
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
that's another important point Thank
 
01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
You representative PRI thank you Mr
 
01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
chairman I will be opposing the a to
 
01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
pass motion um because I think this is a
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
very important step for communities to
 
01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
make and then there needs to be
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
discussion and debate among them and
 
01:12:58.750 --> 01:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
before they vote and make this decision
 
01:13:03.149 --> 01:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%

01:13:25.629 --> 01:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
to be held when when
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%

01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
brother I thought it was amazing and I
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
thought it was the purest form of
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
democracy uh ever devised by man uh and
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
when sb2 came around I was uh I was not
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
a a proponent of it because of of the
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
fact that people don't need to go to
 
01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
town meeting they can simply go to their
 
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh election to the polls and make their
 
01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:45.400 align:start position:0%
voice heard but I have come around now
 
01:14:50.629 --> 01:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
to the to the point that I see that sb2
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
has has gotten much more particip IP
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
ation then uh it doesn't have the
 
01:15:01.229 --> 01:15:01.239 align:start position:0%
entertainment value of the traditional
 
01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:06.520 align:start position:0%
town meeting but it it does uh uh allow
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
for uh people to debate uh by going to
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions and then it opens
 
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the voting up to people who uh
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason cannot ATT attend an
 
01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
extended town meeting so I think the the
 
01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
vote the bill here to allow people to
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
vote uh through the polls of whether to
 
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
go to sb2 or or retain the the uh
 
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
traditional town meeting I I think
 
01:15:49.629 --> 01:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing and so I will be uh
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
supporting the
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
bill represent majority thank you Mr
 
01:15:57.629 --> 01:15:57.639 align:start position:0%
chairman as always anytime my friend
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
from Lichfield says something I agree
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
with him and and enjoy his conversation
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
and his uh and and the and everything
 
01:16:07.709 --> 01:16:07.719 align:start position:0%
that you put behind it knowledge and
 
01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
experience and agreed with 75% of
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
everything you just said now um I think
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
that this that the town meeting form of
 
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
government is the truest form of
 
01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
government and should I would like it to
 
01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
be maybe ignorantly the time when the
 
01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
community comes out and if they come out
 
01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
with rotten apples and tomatoes so be it
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
if it's brother against brother husband
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
against wife so be it but I think this
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to discuss this in public to
 
01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
discuss this with your with your friends
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
and your residents is is the place for
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
this and doing it on the ballot I don't
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
see how it's going to get that much more
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
because you are going to drive people to
 
01:16:51.709 --> 01:16:51.719 align:start position:0%
the town meeting when you do it this way
 
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what we should be
 
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.790 --> 01:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative El uh representative
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair um I was
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
tossed up on this question but having
 
01:17:08.830 --> 01:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
experienced SP2 for just about my entire
 
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
voting life I think yeah my entire
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
voting life
 
01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
um there is still the the opportunity
 
01:17:19.149 --> 01:17:19.159 align:start position:0%
for what feels like the traditional town
 
01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
meeting and that's called the
 
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
deliberative session and the people that
 
01:17:24.990 --> 01:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
attend the deliberative session are the
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
ones that have the power to make the
 
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
changes that they may want to make um
 
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry for those that don't go to
 
01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
the deliberative session but it's the
 
01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
same as uh not showing up at a town
 
01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
meeting so I I have to um oppose the OTP
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
because uh the sb2 actually did very
 
01:17:49.709 --> 01:17:49.719 align:start position:0%
little to change the town except for
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
allowing more people to have a vote in
 
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
the end or make it convenient I suppose
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's more of a convenience factor um but
 
01:17:59.430 --> 01:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
they still the the 50 people that show
 
01:18:01.149 --> 01:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
up at the deliberative session still
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
have the same Authority and the same
 
01:18:05.229 --> 01:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
power as the 50 people that show up at a
 
01:18:09.149 --> 01:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
you just so everybody in the room knows
 
01:18:14.629 --> 01:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
I've most of you many of you don't
 
01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
normally sit here so the way I kind of
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
go about recognizing people at first I
 
01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
kind of alternate between Democrats and
 
01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
Republicans then I also um go by who's
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
spoken and who is not so if you see me
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
kind of going out of order to what
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
you're used to that's the reason I do it
 
01:18:36.669 --> 01:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
that way and with that I'll
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
representative kahill is up thank you Mr
 
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
chair um I too like my my colleague
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
moved up from Washington DC in 2006 and
 
01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
um you know I just wanted to add to this
 
01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
discussion that our deliberative
 
01:18:55.629 --> 01:18:55.639 align:start position:0%
sessions at least in in my town and my
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
observation is our deliberative sessions
 
01:18:59.030 --> 01:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
I've seen some good deliberative
 
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
sessions it's really great getting to
 
01:19:02.669 --> 01:19:02.679 align:start position:0%
know the people really talk to them but
 
01:19:04.110 --> 01:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
man oh man there's less and less
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
participation in the deliberative
 
01:19:10.149 --> 01:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
sessions um and I'm not sure why that is
 
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
but I just just wanted to point out that
 
01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
we're getting less and less
 
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
people representative
 
01:19:22.110 --> 01:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
Elwood thank you Mr chairman so our town
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
uh went to
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
sb2 and yes uh the deliberative sessions
 
01:19:29.790 --> 01:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
are well
 
01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
attended um it's far more
 
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
civilized and in fact I insisted that
 
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
they have rules of procedure to hold the
 
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
deliberative session which they did so I
 
01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
I think the atmosphere between the
 
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
traditional town meeting in SP2
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
deliberative session
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
um was more workable it was more
 
01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:58.270 align:start position:0%
um was more workable it was more
welcoming

01:19:58.270 --> 01:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
welcoming
 
01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:03.880 align:start position:0%

have is what happens if we get the same

vote we have one further motion that can
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
be made if that okay motion is also tied
 
01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
then it would go to the floor without

01:23:29.669 --> 01:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
representative lales question of the
 
01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
chair so if we voted interim study it
 
01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:38.440 align:start position:0%
would go to the floor as interim study
 
01:23:41.229 --> 01:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
now would the
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
house o on the floor be able to vote
 
01:23:47.550 --> 01:23:47.560 align:start position:0%
down interim study and vote one way or
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
correct repr major and thank you Mr
 
01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and if interim study does pass
 
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
I I I certainly believe that there will
 
01:24:06.030 --> 01:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
be plenty of people who would like to
 
01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
sit on this and and do the work because
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
it is an important issue um I'm sure we
 
01:24:16.149 --> 01:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
people representative yella did I open
 
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
up a can of
 
01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
worms I mean I it begs the question what
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
work do you believe is necessary if if
 
01:24:29.950 --> 01:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
the if we've done it this way for you
 
01:24:34.510 --> 01:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
know almost 30 years and we've and we've
 
01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
done the other way for almost two years
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
what what is there more information
 
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
could we possibly have on that topic
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative majori would you be would
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
you be open to resending your your
 
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
motion and letting we could let this go
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
no well no let's let's go we'll take if
 
01:25:02.669 --> 01:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
we can thank you Mr chairman for the
 
01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity I would like it to to take a
 
01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
vote on the interim study and let's see
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
what we got okay very good further
 
01:25:12.109 --> 01:25:12.119 align:start position:0%
comments uh represent Gall um yeah I
 
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
just think that since the um both the
 
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
OTP and the itl votes both tied nine to
 
01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
n that um opinions are already pretty
 
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
set and Stone this and I don't think
 
01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:27.800 align:start position:0%
that interm stud is really going to
 
01:25:33.470 --> 01:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
change much of anything um but um I mean
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm open to it so um I guess being
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
later in the RO roll call I'll just see
 
01:25:46.189 --> 01:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
going I'm inclined to agree with my
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
colleague representative yella I mean
 
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
to me it's black and white you either
 
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
believe in taking it to the ballot or
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
you don't I mean we've had lots of
 
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
experience with this I I will not
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
support interim study because I don't I
 
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
don't know what could be gained by
 
01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
it okay s see seeing no further
 
01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
questions so L the clerk call a rooll on
 
01:26:29.310 --> 01:26:29.320 align:start position:0%

going through all those three motions
 
01:27:32.189 --> 01:27:32.199 align:start position:0%
was just to exhaust the emotions
 
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
available to us so uh three votes of n-
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
n uh this will go on the uh regular
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
calendar as uh without
 
01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation um who would like to a
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative power will write the
 
01:27:53.790 --> 01:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
report and I would expect represent
 
01:27:55.950 --> 01:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
majority write the other one yes sir am
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
I ask a question of the chair when
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
you're ready yeah sure just on the for
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
the calendar it'll say no recommendation
 
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
what will it say for the
 
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
vote I think it'll I think it'll say 99
 
01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
I'd have study no it this is without
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation so it won't say anything
 
01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
so with that folk we'll close the
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
executive session on 1175 and the next
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
time the chair says ask about an interim
 
01:28:46.990 --> 01:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:51.310 --> 01:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
them okay um we're actually moving along
 
01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
quite well is everybody doing well or do
 
01:28:54.910 --> 01:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
we like a five or minute break or
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
everybody's good okay I'll tell you what
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
let's just want to do one more a break
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
yeah after yeah let's just do one more
 
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
um just so everybody knows uh HB there
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
are two bills that we will not exec
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
today there potentially more but two we
 
01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
won't that we will do on the 20th and
 
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
that is uh this next one that on the
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
list HB 1181 that's because um we've
 
01:29:21.229 --> 01:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
received a couple of amendments that I
 
01:29:23.189 --> 01:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
was told we would be receiving and we
 
01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
just got them now they're too detailed I
 
01:29:28.990 --> 01:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
think to reasonably expect us to go
 
01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
through them and vote on them the other
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
one will be HB 1223 which is the uh
 
01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing uh that one also
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
we have a very lengthy one pending and
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
allegedly all parties are working
 
01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
together to see if they
 
01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
can come to an agreement on that so
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
those two will be postponed so with that
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
we will go ahead and open up the exec
 
01:29:57.070 --> 01:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
session on 1187 uh
 
01:29:59.669 --> 01:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
1187 relative to prohibiting lease
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%

to come up with to revise it based on
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
their feedback addressing their concerns
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
because whenever I um file any bills
 
01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's never my intent to break anything I
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
I just my intent is to improve things so
 
01:31:41.709 --> 01:31:41.719 align:start position:0%
like I said um I worked very closely
 
01:31:41.719 --> 01:31:43.390 align:start position:0%
like I said um I worked very closely
with

01:31:43.390 --> 01:31:43.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:31:45.870 --> 01:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
nhma there was a lot of back and forth
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
there were several um
 
01:31:51.189 --> 01:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
aversions and as we came upon the
 
01:31:54.510 --> 01:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
hearing I submitted an amendment
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
based on the latest version that that we
 
01:31:58.910 --> 01:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
had collaborated on and that is what I
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
brought to this committee so after the
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
hear you know after the hearing and
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimony and the
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
feedback and the questions that this
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
committee asked I then um took that
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
under advisement and seriously
 
01:32:19.109 --> 01:32:19.119 align:start position:0%
considered all of that information and
 
01:32:21.629 --> 01:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
that's how I arrived at the amendment in
 
01:32:24.030 --> 01:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
front of you so basically what this
 
01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment does is it retains only one uh
 
01:32:33.709 --> 01:32:33.719 align:start position:0%
uh well one major aspect of the bill as
 
01:32:37.550 --> 01:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
filed and that is
 
01:32:41.310 --> 01:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
um dealing with the the concern of the
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
the loophole in which
 
01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
um school districts
 
01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
and mostly that I had seen taking
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
advantage of this loophole in which they
 
01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
were take they were putting lease
 
01:33:03.109 --> 01:33:03.119 align:start position:0%
agreements with Escape Clauses on the
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
really returnable under an escape clause
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
for a lease agreement they they were
 
01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
fixed items such as Windows HVAC
 
01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:24.350 align:start position:0%
fixed items such as Windows HVAC
flooring

01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
flooring
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
Etc and it really didn't make any sense
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
and when when you looked at the statute
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
um governing this
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
section the it was a clear leap loophole
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
that un
 
01:33:43.590 --> 01:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
that was a go around for a provision in
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
another um area of Statute where it says
 
01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:51.800 align:start position:0%
that a lease of goods that are
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
fixtures or may continue Goods that
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
but the there was just another section
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
Con that there was a loophole so I'm
 
01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
just trying to I'm just trying to close
 
01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:12.910 align:start position:0%
just trying to I'm just trying to close
that

01:34:12.910 --> 01:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
and the other thing that this amendment
 
01:34:21.310 --> 01:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
does is it it just defines as a lease
 
01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
article so I hope I I I hope that I
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
enough representative kahill thank you
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um you know I think what we're
 
01:34:42.750 --> 01:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
trying to solve here is a loophole um
 
01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
that has
 
01:34:47.669 --> 01:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
allowed a workaround on the will of the
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
taxpayers potentially um for example in
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
in my town currently we're putting in a
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
solar project and
 
01:34:58.669 --> 01:34:58.679 align:start position:0%
some wood boilers that use wood and
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
we're doing it with this this lease
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
agreement you know so I question the
 
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent on and I want to talk to
 
01:35:05.470 --> 01:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
him and I was like are we doing this as
 
01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
a lease and he was like oh yeah yeah
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
yeah we're we're potentially spending
 
01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
more taxpayer
 
01:35:15.550 --> 01:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
money to accomplish something that we
 
01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
could do if we just purchase them
 
01:35:19.470 --> 01:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
outright with a traditional Warren
 
01:35:20.830 --> 01:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
article these leases these lease
 
01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
agreements tend to you know you you go
 
01:35:25.149 --> 01:35:25.159 align:start position:0%
down the rental store and you you lease
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
a TV you're going to spend more than the
 
01:35:28.830 --> 01:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
cost of the TV if you rent it for a year
 
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
you know what I mean these lease
 
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
agreements I think aren't a beneficial
 
01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
thing for the actual taxpayers it might
 
01:35:38.910 --> 01:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
be good to get your little idea done but
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's a wise use of
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:47.470 --> 01:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
money represent
 
01:35:50.109 --> 01:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chairman uh I just
 
01:35:52.109 --> 01:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
experienced this uh this past weekend
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
with our school board and M bur and uh
 
01:35:58.990 --> 01:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
the the first uh warrant was to go ahead
 
01:36:00.750 --> 01:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
and bond the work and do the work like
 
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
it would normally be done as was
 
01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
intended by the law uh that didn't pass
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
so they went to the know fourth or fifth
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
warrant on the for the school board and
 
01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
they attempted to pass it uh and and
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
what would have happened is it would
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
have cost the taxpayers another $800,000
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
to do this work U so I spoke about it
 
01:36:25.229 --> 01:36:25.239 align:start position:0%
and and how the fact that this is an
 
01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
apparent loophole that initially this
 
01:36:30.669 --> 01:36:30.679 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be used for buying fire
 
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
trucks or other heavy equipment that
 
01:36:34.510 --> 01:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
town that the town might need and could
 
01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
return if the lease Provisions didn't
 
01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
work out this type of equipment as
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
representative kahill indicated was for
 
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
solar panels that was also a 19-year
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
payback 19 years so it certainly didn't
 
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
justify in face value anyways but it was
 
01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
an attempt to move forward with
 
01:36:55.229 --> 01:36:55.239 align:start position:0%
something that uh wasn't reasonable that
 
01:36:58.350 --> 01:36:58.360 align:start position:0%
would have initially been a lower cost
 
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh but on the long term would have been
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
significantly higher so fortunately they
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
didn't pass it um the only difference
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
between what the representative power
 
01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
and what I would like to do is I would
 
01:37:11.310 --> 01:37:11.320 align:start position:0%
have liked to have had this uh this
 
01:37:13.950 --> 01:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
situation covered by a super majority as
 
01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:16.360 align:start position:0%
well but she decided to do this as a
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
simple procedure it would just be very
 
01:37:21.550 --> 01:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
clear as to what we were attempting to
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
do with this and I appreciate what she's
 
01:37:25.629 --> 01:37:25.639 align:start position:0%
done so thank
 
01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
you further comments representative
 
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
Maori thank you Mr chairman um I thank
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
my friend from Brookline for putting the
 
01:37:38.669 --> 01:37:38.679 align:start position:0%
work into this if there is a loop well
 
01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
there there seemingly is a loophole in
 
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
some municipalities as we heard in the
 
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
hearing as we are are hearing now it
 
01:37:48.990 --> 01:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
seems that the amendment is responsive
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
to what was heard in the hearing it
 
01:37:54.109 --> 01:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
seems the amendment is responsive
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
um to concerns uh raised concerns that
 
01:38:00.189 --> 01:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
are raised and as such since the
 
01:38:02.350 --> 01:38:02.360 align:start position:0%
amendment closes that
 
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
loophole and that's all that this does
 
01:38:07.229 --> 01:38:07.239 align:start position:0%
then I can support the amendment and i
 
01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
would support the bill as
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
amended thank you thank you further com
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me further comments or
 
01:38:20.229 --> 01:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none uh I have one
 
01:38:23.709 --> 01:38:23.719 align:start position:0%
question for the amendment sponsor on
 
01:38:28.189 --> 01:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
line 21 or 20 and
 
01:38:32.350 --> 01:38:32.360 align:start position:0%
21 without pulling out the RSA and
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
looking up on the laptop here does the
 
01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
issuance or continu continuation of
 
01:38:41.589 --> 01:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
lease agreements have any
 
01:38:46.270 --> 01:38:46.280 align:start position:0%
dollar value attached in other words if
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
they um had a lease agreement uh for say
 
01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
$500 with that still
 
01:39:01.870 --> 01:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:07.229 --> 01:39:07.239 align:start position:0%
sure um thank you Mr chairman so that
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
section two of the amendment that just
 
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
pertains to um adding into the list of
 
01:39:16.709 --> 01:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
articles lease agreements that's that's
 
01:39:21.629 --> 01:39:21.639 align:start position:0%
all that that
 
01:39:24.149 --> 01:39:24.159 align:start position:0%
does correct and
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh follow I'll follow it up it adds into
 
01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:29.270 align:start position:0%
uh follow I'll follow it up it adds into
the

01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
definition but the current definition is
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the amount to be
 
01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
raised by the issuance of bonds or notes
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
which are generally high dollar
 
01:39:45.070 --> 01:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
items the I mean I understand what
 
01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do with close a
 
01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
loophole and I'm totally in agreement
 
01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
with this I just want to make sure that
 
01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:49.629 align:start position:0%
with this I just want to make sure that
we're

01:39:49.629 --> 01:39:49.639 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
not doing something there that has
 
01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
that the intent isn't
 
01:39:59.470 --> 01:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
correct um does it make
 
01:40:03.189 --> 01:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
sense so these lease agreements they
 
01:40:04.750 --> 01:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
they're they're
 
01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:06.950 align:start position:0%
they're they're
multi-e

01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
multi-e
 
01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure that I'm compro
 
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
comprehending your question but I I did
 
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
work very closely with nhma as well as
 
01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
with OS and I'm confident that this um
 
01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
does not break anything or there should
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
be no concerns about the this this part
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
amendment somebody else want to take a
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
stab at it representative
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
yell thank you um
 
01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
so I believe your question is about
 
01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:37.390 align:start position:0%
so I believe your question is about
section

01:40:37.390 --> 01:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
two and um the the part
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
of the law that is being changed is just
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
the definition of what is considered a
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
special warrant article and so if you
 
01:40:57.870 --> 01:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
had a warrant article that was a lease
 
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
agreement before apparently it wasn't
 
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
considered a special warrant article and
 
01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
so all this would be saying is that it's
 
01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
also considered a special warrant
 
01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:10.159 align:start position:0%
article and so there is no
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh amount of money that would be that
 
01:41:18.629 --> 01:41:18.639 align:start position:0%
that would be at issue if by calling it
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
a special warrant
 
01:41:22.189 --> 01:41:22.199 align:start position:0%
article like that you're just saying
 
01:41:24.750 --> 01:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
that that this is just article right I
 
01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
understand right but what I'm asking
 
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
is if let's say there was
 
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
a when there's a call for appropriation
 
01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
if now all uh issuance of of lease or
 
01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
continuing of lease agree agreements
 
01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
need to be on a warrant article let's
 
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
just say there was a lease agreement
 
01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:49.510 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:50.750 align:start position:0%
that was
[Music]

01:41:50.750 --> 01:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:41:54.189 --> 01:41:54.199 align:start position:0%
for $500 or something is that still
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
going to be included on is that the
 
01:41:59.589 --> 01:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
intent I'm just trying to figure it out
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:13.149 --> 01:42:13.159 align:start position:0%
answer would it be Advantage if I I
 
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
don't think that it's necessary could
 
01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:18.159 align:start position:0%
there's there if you read the thing it's
 
01:42:20.430 --> 01:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
a it's even talking about like things
 
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
submitted by petition so if you had a
 
01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
petition that had a lease that was $5
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
right that still is considered a special
 
01:42:29.669 --> 01:42:29.679 align:start position:0%
warrant article I don't think that this
 
01:42:32.830 --> 01:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
breaks anything by calling a lease of
 
01:42:34.589 --> 01:42:34.599 align:start position:0%
special warrant article if it's put on
 
01:42:34.599 --> 01:42:38.550 align:start position:0%
special warrant article if it's put on
the

01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
warrant repres it's a very broad
 
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman uh I also
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
have the same concerns that you have um
 
01:42:55.229 --> 01:42:55.239 align:start position:0%
because the dollar amounts aren't there
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
and so I I have a feeling that even
 
01:43:03.229 --> 01:43:03.239 align:start position:0%
though the intent was to simplify and
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
clarify it it now puts all budgetary
 
01:43:12.189 --> 01:43:12.199 align:start position:0%
lease items as warant articles and I
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
think that is could be ve have very
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences for local
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
governments everything would be up for
 
01:43:23.709 --> 01:43:23.719 align:start position:0%
debate and vote
 
01:43:27.229 --> 01:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
how about this how um we have many more
 
01:43:29.390 --> 01:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
bills we can go through why don't we
 
01:43:33.070 --> 01:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
recess this particular Bill
 
01:43:36.270 --> 01:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
until uh I'm just going to put a a Time
 
01:43:37.629 --> 01:43:37.639 align:start position:0%
on it say of
 
01:43:40.589 --> 01:43:40.599 align:start position:0%
11:45 that'll give us uh time we can go
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
through a few more of these and then
 
01:43:46.030 --> 01:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
come back to this one I just again I'm
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
to in total agreement on trying to close
 
01:43:49.470 --> 01:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
this loophole I just want to make sure
 
01:43:51.589 --> 01:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
we're not doing anything with that line
 
01:43:54.910 --> 01:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
01:43:57.229 --> 01:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
not going to work so we'll we'll we'll
 
01:44:00.030 --> 01:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
recess this one until 11:45 and then
 
01:44:05.149 --> 01:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
we'll go ahead and move on to a next one
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
here you said that we would be taking a
 
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
break after this yes we will uh why
 
01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
don't we take uh 10 minutes everybody
 
01:44:22.030 --> 01:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:52.030 align:start position:0%

had disagreements about uh about what
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
happened how it happened why it happened
 
01:58:24.109 --> 01:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
last year with the districting of
 
01:58:25.870 --> 01:58:25.880 align:start position:0%

01:58:32.189 --> 01:58:32.199 align:start position:0%
the intent that uh straford County was
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
working well uh it was the intent that
 
01:58:37.390 --> 01:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
to keep straford County working well
 
01:58:40.310 --> 01:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
that uh that we don't mess with things
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh there were uh we've heard many times
 
01:58:46.910 --> 01:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
that uh it would be that the bill uh
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
that was passed last year would allow
 
01:58:51.709 --> 01:58:51.719 align:start position:0%
for a Better Mix Republicans and
 
01:58:54.270 --> 01:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
Democrat rats we've heard numerous time
 
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
on on County Commissioners we've heard
 
01:58:58.229 --> 01:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
numerous times that there have been many
 
01:58:59.470 --> 01:58:59.480 align:start position:0%
Republicans or there have been
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
Republicans excuse me who have been
 
01:59:04.149 --> 01:59:04.159 align:start position:0%
elected uh and those Republicans have
 
01:59:06.069 --> 01:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
also been defeated by democrats it seems
 
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
to be the will of the people uh to have
 
01:59:10.229 --> 01:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
those that they want serving an office
 
01:59:12.189 --> 01:59:12.199 align:start position:0%
to serve an office so we would we would
 
01:59:15.310 --> 01:59:15.320 align:start position:0%
urge that this bill be ought to pass and
 
01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh and I thank you for your time
 
01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
represent kill thank you Mr chair I
 
01:59:23.149 --> 01:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
greatly appreciate everything that my
 
01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
colleague adds I I I will disagree that
 
01:59:28.589 --> 01:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
it was about Democrats Republicans
 
01:59:30.589 --> 01:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
having having many friends that live in
 
01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
straford County up north in the farm
 
01:59:34.629 --> 01:59:34.639 align:start position:0%
country I think this was more about
 
01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:36.719 align:start position:0%
representation of their their life
 
01:59:39.709 --> 01:59:39.719 align:start position:0%
choices being versus having all your
 
01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioners come from cities having
 
01:59:43.870 --> 01:59:43.880 align:start position:0%
someone represent those those farmers in
 
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
those rural areas and that's not
 
01:59:47.350 --> 01:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily Republican Democrat I think
 
01:59:49.629 --> 01:59:49.639 align:start position:0%
there's Democrat Farmers out there too I
 
01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
hope I hope so I know we have we have
 
01:59:54.510 --> 01:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
our our colleague over here um is big on
 
01:59:57.069 --> 01:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
um composting and things like that so
 
02:00:00.589 --> 02:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
you know I mean um I'm sure that I I
 
02:00:02.709 --> 02:00:02.719 align:start position:0%
just wanted to add that I think
 
02:00:05.229 --> 02:00:05.239 align:start position:0%
that we did have disagreements about the
 
02:00:07.390 --> 02:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
bill last year and it did pass and I do
 
02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
believe it became
 
02:00:08.719 --> 02:00:11.950 align:start position:0%
believe it became
law

02:00:11.950 --> 02:00:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:15.390 --> 02:00:15.400 align:start position:0%
no it did
 
02:00:19.149 --> 02:00:19.159 align:start position:0%
so um but I don't think it was about
 
02:00:21.510 --> 02:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
Republican Democrat I think it was about
 
02:00:24.189 --> 02:00:24.199 align:start position:0%
way of way of life being represented in
 
02:00:26.030 --> 02:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
your local area local control right
 
02:00:28.030 --> 02:00:28.040 align:start position:0%
we're always talking about local control
 
02:00:30.109 --> 02:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
and I think having someone represent you
 
02:00:37.069 --> 02:00:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.870 --> 02:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
control further comments represent
 
02:00:42.990 --> 02:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman um I will
 
02:00:46.830 --> 02:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
be also supporting the utop pass bill
 
02:00:51.390 --> 02:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
and the reason for this is that the
 
02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:52.510 align:start position:0%
and the reason for this is that the
process

02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:00:57.229 --> 02:00:57.239 align:start position:0%
where the previous bill went I really
 
02:01:00.830 --> 02:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
disagreed with and I believe strongly
 
02:01:02.510 --> 02:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
that if there
 
02:01:06.510 --> 02:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
were uh citizens in Stratford County
 
02:01:10.270 --> 02:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
that felt that their views were not
 
02:01:14.109 --> 02:01:14.119 align:start position:0%
being Representatives Farmers or no
 
02:01:18.189 --> 02:01:18.199 align:start position:0%
Farmers there's a process there that has
 
02:01:21.189 --> 02:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
been working for years and years that
 
02:01:24.390 --> 02:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
you vote the Commissioners out and you
 
02:01:28.790 --> 02:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
put in someone that addresses your
 
02:01:33.470 --> 02:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
concerns and I don't and I believe also
 
02:01:37.470 --> 02:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
that if there was enough people in
 
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
Stratford County that wanted to have
 
02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:42.390 align:start position:0%
Stratford County that wanted to have
District

02:01:42.390 --> 02:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
District
 
02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that there would be a
 
02:01:46.470 --> 02:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
process where there would be hearings
 
02:01:50.229 --> 02:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
and discussions and maybe workshops for
 
02:01:52.750 --> 02:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
people to participate in
 
02:01:55.310 --> 02:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
in and if that was the will of the
 
02:01:58.589 --> 02:01:58.599 align:start position:0%
people then that would have happened but
 
02:02:01.589 --> 02:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
to go about the process where the
 
02:02:03.030 --> 02:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
previous bill
 
02:02:08.750 --> 02:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
was was wrong and so that's why I am uh
 
02:02:14.589 --> 02:02:14.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:16.910 --> 02:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none Believe It or Not
 
02:02:20.830 --> 02:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
Your chairman has no comments
 
02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:22.750 align:start position:0%
Your chairman has no comments
kidding

02:02:22.750 --> 02:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
kidding
 
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:30.270 --> 02:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
go straford County was the only County
 
02:02:33.669 --> 02:02:33.679 align:start position:0%
of our 10 that for at least the last 40
 
02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
years that chairman mcgis has ruled the
 
02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:37.750 align:start position:0%
years that chairman mcgis has ruled the
C

02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
C
 
02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:40.229 align:start position:0%
C
County

02:02:40.229 --> 02:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
County
 
02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
um has
 
02:02:46.470 --> 02:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
been almost 100%
 
02:02:49.069 --> 02:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
Democrat so let's take a look at why
 
02:02:49.079 --> 02:02:50.030 align:start position:0%
Democrat so let's take a look at why
that

02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
is the county is made made up of
 
02:02:59.350 --> 02:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
Republicans in 40 years that chairman
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
mcgis has been there there have been 20
 
02:03:08.069 --> 02:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
election Cycles follow me on the numbers
 
02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
here 20 election
 
02:03:13.149 --> 02:03:13.159 align:start position:0%
Cycles that's 20 elections times three
 
02:03:16.350 --> 02:03:16.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that's 60 Commissioners
 
02:03:18.790 --> 02:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
that have been potentially or have been
 
02:03:20.750 --> 02:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
elected in straford
 
02:03:24.510 --> 02:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
County during those 40 years in a county
 
02:03:27.470 --> 02:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:29.069 align:start position:0%
that is
42

02:03:29.069 --> 02:03:29.079 align:start position:0%
42
 
02:03:32.629 --> 02:03:32.639 align:start position:0%
58 ratio there have been
 
02:03:35.669 --> 02:03:35.679 align:start position:0%
two two Republicans
 
02:03:42.629 --> 02:03:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
Republican I considered what had been
 
02:03:47.310 --> 02:03:47.320 align:start position:0%
going on for 40 years and I don't really
 
02:03:49.589 --> 02:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
even understand how it was allowed to go
 
02:03:52.709 --> 02:03:52.719 align:start position:0%
on for 40 for years but B basically you
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
had a county that was geremander by
 
02:04:01.109 --> 02:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:01.119 --> 02:04:09.549 align:start position:0%
 
had

02:04:09.549 --> 02:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:13.549 --> 02:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
the commissioner mcgis made multiple
 
02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
multiple statements at our last hearing
 
02:04:18.870 --> 02:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
here some that are just outright wrong
 
02:04:22.510 --> 02:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
some that are extremely misleading uh
 
02:04:25.270 --> 02:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
one of them was that well Republicans
 
02:04:27.470 --> 02:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
have got elected in the district well
 
02:04:28.830 --> 02:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
here's here's the
 
02:04:31.470 --> 02:04:31.480 align:start position:0%
thing you've had two Republican
 
02:04:35.390 --> 02:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:38.149 --> 02:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
60 you might have had a republican
 
02:04:40.870 --> 02:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
Sheriff you might have had a republican
 
02:04:42.950 --> 02:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
registar Deeds you might have had a
 
02:04:45.589 --> 02:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
republican occasional something else but
 
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's not a
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner it's not a commissioner
 
02:04:55.790 --> 02:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:00.750 --> 02:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
years again we were the only County that
 
02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
elected at large now if this is such a
 
02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:06.109 align:start position:0%
elected at large now if this is such a
great

02:05:06.109 --> 02:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
idea I would ask everybody to go to
 
02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:09.270 align:start position:0%
idea I would ask everybody to go to
their

02:05:09.270 --> 02:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:11.430 align:start position:0%
their
counties

02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
counties
 
02:05:14.270 --> 02:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
and ask your Commissioners do you want
 
02:05:16.430 --> 02:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
to get elected at large I think you
 
02:05:18.149 --> 02:05:18.159 align:start position:0%
would find the answer to that would be
 
02:05:20.430 --> 02:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
no but if someone were to bring bring
 
02:05:22.910 --> 02:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
forth a bill that said that
 
02:05:25.390 --> 02:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
maybe I would vote for that but in
 
02:05:28.189 --> 02:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
straford County we want the ability to
 
02:05:33.950 --> 02:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
aisle the other thing uh representative
 
02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
McClair mention was that the vote taken
 
02:05:42.589 --> 02:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
at the house last year was
 
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
somehow not valid because of situation
 
02:05:49.229 --> 02:05:49.239 align:start position:0%
with a current Republican or a repu
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
former Republican who was living out of
 
02:05:53.549 --> 02:05:53.559 align:start position:0%
uh his
 
02:05:56.310 --> 02:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
district the vote on the house floor was
 
02:05:59.310 --> 02:05:59.320 align:start position:0%
by one vote the speaker did not vote in
 
02:06:01.549 --> 02:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
that vote which means it would have been
 
02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
a tie and the speaker would have cast
 
02:06:06.709 --> 02:06:06.719 align:start position:0%
the deciding vote in
 
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
favor going back to what is in front of
 
02:06:12.549 --> 02:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
us would actually
 
02:06:16.510 --> 02:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
be very much a jander district jander
 
02:06:18.030 --> 02:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
district for those of you who don't
 
02:06:21.069 --> 02:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
understand what the term means is
 
02:06:21.079 --> 02:06:22.549 align:start position:0%
understand what the term means is
basically

02:06:22.549 --> 02:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:06:25.790 --> 02:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
creating a county a
 
02:06:29.109 --> 02:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
district that severely favors one party
 
02:06:31.669 --> 02:06:31.679 align:start position:0%
or the other and that's exactly what we
 
02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
had in straford county and that's
 
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
exactly what we would be going back to
 
02:06:38.910 --> 02:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
uh If This Were to
 
02:06:41.589 --> 02:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
pass uh representative mcgis mentioned
 
02:06:44.069 --> 02:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
that this was unconstitutional no it's
 
02:06:44.079 --> 02:06:45.270 align:start position:0%
that this was unconstitutional no it's
not

02:06:45.270 --> 02:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:06:49.350 --> 02:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um the Senate uh talked
 
02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
with their uh legal representation
 
02:06:54.950 --> 02:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
before this bill even hit the floor I
 
02:06:57.270 --> 02:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
spoke with the secretary of state and
 
02:07:00.510 --> 02:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state was uh said this
 
02:07:00.520 --> 02:07:01.669 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state was uh said this
was

02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
totally uh relevant and able to be done
 
02:07:07.310 --> 02:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
because one by one over the decades each
 
02:07:09.109 --> 02:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
of the counties had gone this
 
02:07:13.109 --> 02:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
direction it's not it we did not
 
02:07:15.549 --> 02:07:15.559 align:start position:0%
redistrict when this bill was our
 
02:07:17.709 --> 02:07:17.719 align:start position:0%
previous bill passed last year it was
 
02:07:17.719 --> 02:07:18.629 align:start position:0%
previous bill passed last year it was
the

02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:07:22.589 --> 02:07:22.599 align:start position:0%
districting of the county this this here
 
02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:27.669 --> 02:07:27.679 align:start position:0%
redistricting um representative mlar
 
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
says on representative uh commissioner M
 
02:07:32.109 --> 02:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
glaris on multiple occasions has
 
02:07:36.270 --> 02:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
threatened legal action on this um there
 
02:07:38.589 --> 02:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
is no court case pending on this there
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
is no court case in process right now
 
02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's because the court case would never
 
02:07:47.390 --> 02:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
win it's it'd be a a waste of the
 
02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:50.430 align:start position:0%
win it's it'd be a a waste of the
taxpayers

02:07:50.430 --> 02:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:52.189 align:start position:0%
 
money

02:07:52.189 --> 02:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:07:54.990 --> 02:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
uh let's see did I get
 
02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
everything so for all those reasons I
 
02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
will be voting against the OTP
 
02:08:03.069 --> 02:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
motion thank you representative K thank
 
02:08:05.229 --> 02:08:05.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I I just would like to add
 
02:08:07.629 --> 02:08:07.639 align:start position:0%
you know to my colleague from my County
 
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County if if we didn't have
 
02:08:12.629 --> 02:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
districts we would have the same
 
02:08:16.109 --> 02:08:16.119 align:start position:0%
scenario going on in our County
 
02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
um there would be whole swwa of rural
 
02:08:21.589 --> 02:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
communities not represented by a rural
 
02:08:24.069 --> 02:08:24.079 align:start position:0%
commissioner if it understands their
 
02:08:26.350 --> 02:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
their needs and what they they need to
 
02:08:27.750 --> 02:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
see happening and and the things that
 
02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
they're looking for and I just don't see
 
02:08:33.589 --> 02:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
this as as a power fight I know many of
 
02:08:35.790 --> 02:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
my colleagues would disagree I see this
 
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
as an um we have to represent those
 
02:08:41.310 --> 02:08:41.320 align:start position:0%
people for for where they live and what
 
02:08:45.270 --> 02:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:47.950 --> 02:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
live further comments represent hack and
 
02:08:50.510 --> 02:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
Philip thank you Mr chair I just wanted
 
02:08:52.149 --> 02:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
to um
 
02:08:53.990 --> 02:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
just bring in a voice that I think is
 
02:08:55.629 --> 02:08:55.639 align:start position:0%
missing from the conversation I know our
 
02:08:58.109 --> 02:08:58.119 align:start position:0%
ranking member uh representative stavis
 
02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
is not here today but um I know that if
 
02:09:04.149 --> 02:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
she was here she would try to remind the
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
group that you know once we've set a
 
02:09:09.149 --> 02:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
quote that I think she was picked up
 
02:09:11.589 --> 02:09:11.599 align:start position:0%
saying was that I quote once we start
 
02:09:13.950 --> 02:09:13.960 align:start position:0%
down the road of changing electoral Maps
 
02:09:16.669 --> 02:09:16.679 align:start position:0%
outside the 10e cycle we're entering
 
02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
dangerous territory unquote and this I
 
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
think was in her mind referring to the
 
02:09:26.549 --> 02:09:26.559 align:start position:0%
precedent that the initial bill sent set
 
02:09:29.790 --> 02:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is um attempting to offer a
 
02:09:31.950 --> 02:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
closing of the door that was opened in
 
02:09:34.669 --> 02:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
the last legislative term so that
 
02:09:36.669 --> 02:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
politics would not be these districts
 
02:09:38.510 --> 02:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
would not be subject to politics in the
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
future but instead it would be up to the
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
electorate itself so um you know I just
 
02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
think there is a hypothetical situation
 
02:09:49.990 --> 02:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
in the future where different potential
 
02:09:52.510 --> 02:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
political makeup of this house the
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
Senate and you know potentially the
 
02:09:57.870 --> 02:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
governor's chair would be in existence
 
02:09:59.790 --> 02:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
where they would want to you know
 
02:10:03.030 --> 02:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
reverse this or and create new districts
 
02:10:04.790 --> 02:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
for many different counties not just
 
02:10:08.910 --> 02:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
straford so I think you know we are this
 
02:10:12.390 --> 02:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
bill is attempting to you know to close
 
02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
that precedent to make sure that we
 
02:10:16.030 --> 02:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
understand that that was a mistake in
 
02:10:18.870 --> 02:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
that you know we don't want politics to
 
02:10:21.589 --> 02:10:21.599 align:start position:0%
be drawing these Maps every legisl of
 
02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
term and um for that reason I think it's
 
02:10:28.310 --> 02:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
important to remember that you know the
 
02:10:31.950 --> 02:10:31.960 align:start position:0%
people who send us to conquered don't
 
02:10:33.990 --> 02:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
want their districts to change every two
 
02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
years based on the new makeup of the
 
02:10:39.229 --> 02:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
bodies um so for that reason I'm going
 
02:10:40.709 --> 02:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
to support the ball I think it's
 
02:10:42.750 --> 02:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
important thank you forur the comments
 
02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
representative Brown thank you Mr
 
02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
chairman now although this might not
 
02:10:50.229 --> 02:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
directly apply it it it this happened in
 
02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
the uh Carol County this past year we
 
02:10:53.589 --> 02:10:53.599 align:start position:0%
had two
 
02:10:56.149 --> 02:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
resignations and when after they had the
 
02:10:59.109 --> 02:10:59.119 align:start position:0%
resignations we had to work to get the
 
02:11:01.549 --> 02:11:01.559 align:start position:0%
candidates uh from the different
 
02:11:04.069 --> 02:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
Geographic areas of the county so that
 
02:11:06.149 --> 02:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
we felt that they were that the whole
 
02:11:08.189 --> 02:11:08.199 align:start position:0%
County was represented by different
 
02:11:10.950 --> 02:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
represented by different people and the
 
02:11:12.709 --> 02:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
whole delegation worked to get a number
 
02:11:16.069 --> 02:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
of candidates and in the end we voted to
 
02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh replace these people through the
 
02:11:20.350 --> 02:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
delegation the point being was that we
 
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
thought it was in important enough to
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
represent the entire County and get
 
02:11:28.270 --> 02:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
people outside of mboro or wolfboro we
 
02:11:29.470 --> 02:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
had plenty of candidates that were
 
02:11:31.910 --> 02:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
willing to run from those areas but the
 
02:11:33.629 --> 02:11:33.639 align:start position:0%
rest of the county did not have that
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
same representation so we felt it was
 
02:11:38.910 --> 02:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
important and the uh existing
 
02:11:40.629 --> 02:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner also felt it was important
 
02:11:42.430 --> 02:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
to have representative from
 
02:11:44.629 --> 02:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
representation from the other areas of
 
02:11:46.950 --> 02:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
the county so that's what we did there
 
02:11:48.750 --> 02:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
and I think it's worked out for us
 
02:11:50.270 --> 02:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
there'll be election to replace these
 
02:11:52.350 --> 02:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
people this fall and I think everybody
 
02:11:54.390 --> 02:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
feels that it's important in our County
 
02:11:56.589 --> 02:11:56.599 align:start position:0%
anyways to have representation from the
 
02:11:59.709 --> 02:11:59.719 align:start position:0%
entire County thank you for the comments
 
02:11:59.719 --> 02:12:01.270 align:start position:0%
entire County thank you for the comments
representative

02:12:01.270 --> 02:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:12:04.030 --> 02:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair I I just
 
02:12:06.870 --> 02:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to um I guess comment on a couple
 
02:12:08.830 --> 02:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
of things that I've heard I appreciate
 
02:12:10.709 --> 02:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
the work that was done in uh
 
02:12:13.149 --> 02:12:13.159 align:start position:0%
representative Browns District uh or
 
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
County um and that's what just what
 
02:12:17.229 --> 02:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
someone else has said is that you have
 
02:12:20.430 --> 02:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
to find candidates um you know do that
 
02:12:22.629 --> 02:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
work and you will get the results that
 
02:12:24.669 --> 02:12:24.679 align:start position:0%
you want
 
02:12:29.149 --> 02:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is that uh I think I
 
02:12:33.549 --> 02:12:33.559 align:start position:0%
think it was Mr chair uh said that
 
02:12:36.750 --> 02:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
um there's a difference between or you
 
02:12:39.870 --> 02:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
can ask people if they want to be in a
 
02:12:43.669 --> 02:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
um districted County or just give them a
 
02:12:46.030 --> 02:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
districted county and I think that maybe
 
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
this is a two
 
02:12:51.310 --> 02:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
question uh matter and that first ask if
 
02:12:53.470 --> 02:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
the county wants to have districts and
 
02:12:55.229 --> 02:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
they may want may want to have four
 
02:12:57.790 --> 02:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
districts you know I I don't know the
 
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
the laws on how many U people are per
 
02:13:03.870 --> 02:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
District but um I think perhaps this is
 
02:13:07.549 --> 02:13:07.559 align:start position:0%
a two question idea and so therefore I'm
 
02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
going to vote OTP to maintain the
 
02:13:13.069 --> 02:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
current um
 
02:13:15.870 --> 02:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
status fur the
 
02:13:19.310 --> 02:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none L the clerk to call
 
02:13:21.669 --> 02:13:21.679 align:start position:0%

recessed HP 1187 until 11:45 it is
 
02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:07.389 align:start position:0%
recessed HP 1187 until 11:45 it is

02:17:07.389 --> 02:17:07.399 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
02:17:10.389 --> 02:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
1145 uh what I'm going to do we have two
 
02:17:12.669 --> 02:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
bills we are already planning to do on
 
02:17:15.669 --> 02:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
the 20th we're going to recess that one
 
02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
um also until the 20th and we'll we'll
 
02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
plan a start time I we only anticipate
 
02:17:25.709 --> 02:17:25.719 align:start position:0%
probably three bills so we're going to
 
02:17:28.389 --> 02:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
make it like around 10:30 uh so I'll
 
02:17:33.950 --> 02:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
just say 10:30 at this point for HB
 
02:17:36.509 --> 02:17:36.519 align:start position:0%
1187 on the
 
02:17:38.870 --> 02:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
20th Mr chair could I just make a quick
 
02:17:40.990 --> 02:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
note to the folks who are working on
 
02:17:42.910 --> 02:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
that um that bill I'm looking at the
 
02:17:44.230 --> 02:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
drafting for the
 
02:17:47.589 --> 02:17:47.599 align:start position:0%
amendment and um I I think they may also
 
02:17:49.030 --> 02:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
need to take a look at one of the
 
02:17:52.509 --> 02:17:52.519 align:start position:0%
subsections of the chapter RSA 33 colon
 
02:17:55.270 --> 02:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
8 what I would suggest is uh once the
 
02:17:57.830 --> 02:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
day is done you can talk with them about
 
02:18:00.150 --> 02:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
that but I'm not certain probably an
 
02:18:01.790 --> 02:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
agreement Happ to do that
 
02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:03.750 align:start position:0%
agreement Happ to do that
yep

02:18:03.750 --> 02:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:18:06.629 --> 02:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
okay uh the next bill on the list HP
 
02:18:10.110 --> 02:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
1223 again that is one we will not exec
 
02:18:14.030 --> 02:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
until 311 why ises that say 311 never
 
02:18:19.589 --> 02:18:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:24.870 --> 02:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
20th okay okay so next we will go
 
02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:28.080 align:start position:0%

02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:31.200 align:start position:0%

chairman um this is an important bill
 
02:19:22.629 --> 02:19:22.639 align:start position:0%
and when the bill was introduced here in
 
02:19:22.639 --> 02:19:24.190 align:start position:0%
and when the bill was introduced here in
committee

02:19:24.190 --> 02:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:19:28.709 --> 02:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
I in my um Zeal to be completely
 
02:19:31.309 --> 02:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
thorough with the wording of the bill
 
02:19:33.389 --> 02:19:33.399 align:start position:0%
and to ensure that there were no
 
02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
loopholes and every eye was dotted and
 
02:19:38.349 --> 02:19:38.359 align:start position:0%
every tea was
 
02:19:38.359 --> 02:19:40.349 align:start position:0%
every tea was
crossed

02:19:40.349 --> 02:19:40.359 align:start position:0%
crossed
 
02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
um the bill as introduced um could be
 
02:19:51.429 --> 02:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
construed as um very perhaps by some
 
02:19:56.990 --> 02:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
complicated and um difficult to to
 
02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
interpret while the bill was conceived
 
02:20:02.510 --> 02:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
in in my head it was very clear and when
 
02:20:06.309 --> 02:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
I do things I do things very with
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
intention and I choose my words very
 
02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
carefully well that being said I um
 
02:20:13.429 --> 02:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
based on
 
02:20:13.439 --> 02:20:14.950 align:start position:0%
based on
feedback

02:20:14.950 --> 02:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
02:20:18.990 --> 02:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
and um concerns that were expressed
 
02:20:21.469 --> 02:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
during the hearing I decided
 
02:20:25.230 --> 02:20:25.240 align:start position:0%
um to submit this amendment and to be
 
02:20:29.550 --> 02:20:29.560 align:start position:0%
clear I did um collaborate with a number
 
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
of different parties Municipal attorney
 
02:20:38.309 --> 02:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um the New Hampshire Fire
 
02:20:41.309 --> 02:20:41.319 align:start position:0%
Marshall and I came up
 
02:20:44.349 --> 02:20:44.359 align:start position:0%
with a number of different amendments
 
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
but I I had to pick one to move forward
 
02:20:49.429 --> 02:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
and that's represented here in the
 
02:20:51.550 --> 02:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of you
 
02:20:58.429 --> 02:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:02.469 --> 02:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
amendment is less wordy and and perhaps
 
02:21:05.309 --> 02:21:05.319 align:start position:0%
maybe even more precise so there's two
 
02:21:08.710 --> 02:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
two things here and what what I did is I
 
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
dialed back the um provision to have no
 
02:21:17.590 --> 02:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
less than two occupants per bedroom in
 
02:21:20.389 --> 02:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
good faith compromise to make things I
 
02:21:20.399 --> 02:21:21.469 align:start position:0%
good faith compromise to make things I
guess

02:21:21.469 --> 02:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
guess
 
02:21:25.270 --> 02:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
less complex I put that to to one
 
02:21:28.590 --> 02:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
occupant per bedroom and the other thing
 
02:21:34.190 --> 02:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
um that's here is that I added in the
 
02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
sentence that says nothing in the
 
02:21:37.830 --> 02:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
section shall prohibit the enforcement
 
02:21:39.950 --> 02:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
of the State Building Code or state fire
 
02:21:43.590 --> 02:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
code again when I file bills it's never
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
my intention to break other things I'm
 
02:21:50.230 --> 02:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
I'm very um cognizant of that and I I I
 
02:21:53.110 --> 02:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
want to make things work and I take
 
02:21:55.270 --> 02:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
great pains to to make sure that things
 
02:21:58.910 --> 02:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
are precise and correct So based on my
 
02:22:00.429 --> 02:22:00.439 align:start position:0%
discussion with the New Hampshire Fire
 
02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
Marshal um in with regards to the
 
02:22:06.270 --> 02:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
wording and looking at um life safety
 
02:22:09.950 --> 02:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
codes and fire codes he has um provided
 
02:22:13.070 --> 02:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
this committee his assurance and his
 
02:22:15.950 --> 02:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
word in writing that he has looked at
 
02:22:18.870 --> 02:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment and there is no issues or
 
02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
concerns with the ability of
 
02:22:25.750 --> 02:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
anybody to be able to enforce State
 
02:22:28.389 --> 02:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
Building Code and state fire code and I
 
02:22:32.070 --> 02:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
would also note that the word State Fire
 
02:22:35.870 --> 02:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
code encompasses fire codes as well as
 
02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
Life Safety codes that's a subtlety in
 
02:22:41.710 --> 02:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
language that people may not understand
 
02:22:46.070 --> 02:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
so um to speak to the necessity of this
 
02:22:48.630 --> 02:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
bill New Hampshire has a well-known
 
02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
deficit of rental house housing as well
 
02:22:54.429 --> 02:22:54.439 align:start position:0%
as high cost to
 
02:22:57.190 --> 02:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
rent the New Hampshire Housing Authority
 
02:23:01.389 --> 02:23:01.399 align:start position:0%
reports from 2023 that the average
 
02:23:03.670 --> 02:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment
 
02:23:08.870 --> 02:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:13.870 --> 02:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
$1,764 this is this represents an 11.4%
 
02:23:16.750 --> 02:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
rent increase Statewide in the past year
 
02:23:18.070 --> 02:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
and we have a
 
02:23:21.510 --> 02:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
0.6% rental vacancy rate
 
02:23:25.510 --> 02:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide where actually a 5% vacancy
 
02:23:27.550 --> 02:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
rate is considered a healthy
 
02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
market so an important piece of the
 
02:23:34.110 --> 02:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
solution to the housing crisis that that
 
02:23:36.030 --> 02:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
we Face here in New
 
02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in my mind is this
 
02:23:42.269 --> 02:23:42.279 align:start position:0%
bill this is a bipartisan
 
02:23:47.630 --> 02:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
Bill and it has 10 State reps 10
 
02:23:50.190 --> 02:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
sponsors from the house and two sponsors
 
02:23:54.030 --> 02:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
from from the Senate and the purpose of
 
02:23:56.790 --> 02:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is to prevent M municipalities
 
02:23:59.389 --> 02:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
from enacting or enforcing local zoning
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
ordinances that restrict renters to less
 
02:24:07.630 --> 02:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
than one person per bedroom in in a
 
02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:09.190 align:start position:0%
than one person per bedroom in in a
residential

02:24:09.190 --> 02:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
residential
 
02:24:12.110 --> 02:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
rental based on my research at least
 
02:24:14.469 --> 02:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
eight municipalities currently have some
 
02:24:17.710 --> 02:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
form of local ordinance that restricts
 
02:24:20.710 --> 02:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
Property Owners from being able to rent
 
02:24:23.469 --> 02:24:23.479 align:start position:0%
a single family dwelling to to no more
 
02:24:27.269 --> 02:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
than three unrelated individuals and as
 
02:24:30.670 --> 02:24:30.680 align:start position:0%
I um explained quite thoroughly
 
02:24:34.429 --> 02:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
in um my bill introduction what this
 
02:24:37.590 --> 02:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
means is if there is a house that has
 
02:24:39.830 --> 02:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
for example four
 
02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:42.230 align:start position:0%
for example four
bedrooms

02:24:42.230 --> 02:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
bedrooms
 
02:24:45.429 --> 02:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
reasonably in general based on the size
 
02:24:48.950 --> 02:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
of the of those bedrooms we're talking
 
02:24:51.269 --> 02:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
two people per bedroom so that's eight
 
02:24:54.630 --> 02:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
housing opportunities and in some
 
02:24:56.990 --> 02:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities they have ordinances that
 
02:24:59.630 --> 02:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
artificially restrict the number of
 
02:25:02.710 --> 02:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
unrelated people that can rent
 
02:25:06.349 --> 02:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
such a residential rental property so
 
02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
that would that leaves five in this
 
02:25:12.269 --> 02:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
example five housing
 
02:25:14.870 --> 02:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities not available off the
 
02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
market when they're sitting there
 
02:25:20.910 --> 02:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
available these bedro rooms are
 
02:25:25.389 --> 02:25:25.399 align:start position:0%
literally locked up we can't use
 
02:25:27.950 --> 02:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
them so what happens yeah these
 
02:25:31.389 --> 02:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
ordinances forc landlords to leave empty
 
02:25:31.399 --> 02:25:33.269 align:start position:0%
ordinances forc landlords to leave empty
bedrooms

02:25:33.269 --> 02:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
bedrooms
 
02:25:37.230 --> 02:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
interestingly and is noteworthy is that
 
02:25:40.230 --> 02:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
many of these municipalities grandfather
 
02:25:42.469 --> 02:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
certain select rental properties so they
 
02:25:44.910 --> 02:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
are exempt from the ordinance and I
 
02:25:47.269 --> 02:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
would contend that if this
 
02:25:50.950 --> 02:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
is a you know a real thing
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
then why why are they grandfathering
 
02:25:56.110 --> 02:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
properties to be
 
02:25:59.590 --> 02:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
clear this practice does not lend for a
 
02:26:02.670 --> 02:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
uniform application of a local ordinance
 
02:26:05.550 --> 02:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
and it should all give us
 
02:26:07.910 --> 02:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
pause furthermore these rental
 
02:26:11.309 --> 02:26:11.319 align:start position:0%
ordinances artif artificially restrict
 
02:26:13.630 --> 02:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
the number of available bedrooms for
 
02:26:16.910 --> 02:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
rent decreasing rental availability and
 
02:26:20.990 --> 02:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
in turn increasing rental costs
 
02:26:23.190 --> 02:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
as I said the State Fire Marshall has
 
02:26:25.870 --> 02:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
worked with me and has indicated that
 
02:26:28.389 --> 02:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
this amendment is compliant with All
 
02:26:31.870 --> 02:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
State Fire and Building
 
02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
Codes supporters of this bill are
 
02:26:36.910 --> 02:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
housing Advocates renters seeking a
 
02:26:40.190 --> 02:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
place to live and landlords who can if
 
02:26:42.190 --> 02:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
this bill were signed into law will be
 
02:26:44.910 --> 02:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
able to fully utilize their properties
 
02:26:47.469 --> 02:26:47.479 align:start position:0%
in a reasonable
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
manner make no mistake if this bill were
 
02:26:53.710 --> 02:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
to be signed into law with the stroke of
 
02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
a pen it will instantly make hundreds of
 
02:27:00.030 --> 02:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
desperately needed housing opportunities
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:08.469 --> 02:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
overnight moreover over time House Bill
 
02:27:11.790 --> 02:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
1281 in my mind will actually decrease
 
02:27:13.990 --> 02:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
rental costs or at least slow the rate
 
02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
of increase by increasing the supply of
 
02:27:21.150 --> 02:27:21.160 align:start position:0%
rental units available more landlords
 
02:27:24.349 --> 02:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
will then be incentivized incentivized
 
02:27:28.230 --> 02:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
to expand their rental um property
 
02:27:32.510 --> 02:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
portfolios once these ordinances are
 
02:27:35.429 --> 02:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
eliminated House Bill 1281 is an
 
02:27:38.710 --> 02:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
important bipartisan step in resolving
 
02:27:41.630 --> 02:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
the housing crisis in the granite state
 
02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
and I would respectfully ask this
 
02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
committee to please support this
 
02:27:49.110 --> 02:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:50.790 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:27:55.750 --> 02:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:59.429 --> 02:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
spear it's uh it's very nice to hear
 
02:28:01.550 --> 02:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
that the fire commissioner was consulted
 
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
on this
 
02:28:05.910 --> 02:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
however I live in a very densely
 
02:28:08.670 --> 02:28:08.680 align:start position:0%
populated community in
 
02:28:11.910 --> 02:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
Nashua this would completely overrun our
 
02:28:15.230 --> 02:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
water supply it would overrun our sewer
 
02:28:18.030 --> 02:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
capability it would overrun our garbage
 
02:28:20.469 --> 02:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
collection we don't have parking for
 
02:28:22.870 --> 02:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing and we' see landlords
 
02:28:25.309 --> 02:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
often from out of state renting
 
02:28:27.870 --> 02:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
properties with no thought whatsoever to
 
02:28:30.110 --> 02:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
what the density of the community looks
 
02:28:34.389 --> 02:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
like when I canvased back in a year and
 
02:28:37.230 --> 02:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
a half ago I actually went to the door
 
02:28:39.630 --> 02:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
of someone who came to the gun came to
 
02:28:41.790 --> 02:28:41.800 align:start position:0%
the door with a rifle strapped across
 
02:28:45.030 --> 02:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
his chest and I asked him why and it was
 
02:28:46.950 --> 02:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
because all of the properties around
 
02:28:50.349 --> 02:28:50.359 align:start position:0%
them had been rented and that he was his
 
02:28:52.630 --> 02:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
was being used as a garbage collection
 
02:28:55.429 --> 02:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
place and he was trying to stop it the
 
02:28:57.990 --> 02:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
problem we have in very densely neighbor
 
02:29:00.550 --> 02:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
in very dense neighborhoods is the fact
 
02:29:03.110 --> 02:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
that the renters because they don't own
 
02:29:05.870 --> 02:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
the property don't end up taking care of
 
02:29:08.710 --> 02:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
it the way the owners do I think that
 
02:29:11.030 --> 02:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
this cannot be left as a mandate to the
 
02:29:13.469 --> 02:29:13.479 align:start position:0%
state we don't have in some communities
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have parking we don't have
 
02:29:18.190 --> 02:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
facilities we don't have water I live
 
02:29:21.269 --> 02:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
with 18 lbs of pressure water you know
 
02:29:22.870 --> 02:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
what it's like in the State House when a
 
02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
bunch of people try to flush the toilet
 
02:29:28.070 --> 02:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
it there's no pressure and that's what
 
02:29:30.190 --> 02:29:30.200 align:start position:0%
it's like where I live you literally
 
02:29:33.349 --> 02:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
cannot take a shower where I live
 
02:29:35.429 --> 02:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
because of the amount of people on that
 
02:29:35.439 --> 02:29:36.269 align:start position:0%
because of the amount of people on that
water

02:29:36.269 --> 02:29:36.279 align:start position:0%
water
 
02:29:39.550 --> 02:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
line it's so the fact is the picture has
 
02:29:42.230 --> 02:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
to be looked at much more broad before
 
02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
you to start deciding whether and a a
 
02:29:47.150 --> 02:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
community can be take can take on the
 
02:29:49.790 --> 02:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
density that this would allow and I and
 
02:29:51.510 --> 02:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
as a a result of that I will vote
 
02:29:51.520 --> 02:29:52.830 align:start position:0%
as a a result of that I will vote
against

02:29:52.830 --> 02:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
against
 
02:29:57.269 --> 02:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
it represent yella
 
02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I
 
02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
um have some concerns about this
 
02:30:08.190 --> 02:30:08.200 align:start position:0%
amendment I liked the idea of
 
02:30:10.910 --> 02:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
restricting municipalities from
 
02:30:10.920 --> 02:30:12.510 align:start position:0%
restricting municipalities from
discrimination

02:30:12.510 --> 02:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
02:30:16.630 --> 02:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
however um I think that often times
 
02:30:20.030 --> 02:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities when you put these rules
 
02:30:22.710 --> 02:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
saying no more
 
02:30:28.070 --> 02:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
than um or uh reasonable or those types
 
02:30:31.950 --> 02:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
of things um we've found that
 
02:30:36.230 --> 02:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities like for the uh for
 
02:30:41.469 --> 02:30:41.479 align:start position:0%
um the adus require up to four parking
 
02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
spaces for a single
 
02:30:46.429 --> 02:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
Adu of less than 800 square ft and
 
02:30:50.429 --> 02:30:50.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities take Liberties and
 
02:30:52.750 --> 02:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
essentially say like when we see
 
02:30:54.550 --> 02:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
something in law that says we can't do
 
02:30:55.950 --> 02:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
more than this then we're going to just
 
02:31:00.150 --> 02:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
do the bare minimum and and I fear that
 
02:31:03.870 --> 02:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
this might encourage municipalities to
 
02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
essentially uh
 
02:31:10.469 --> 02:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
limit um one and family one and two
 
02:31:13.389 --> 02:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
family dwellings unnecessarily not even
 
02:31:16.309 --> 02:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
talking about the municipalities that
 
02:31:20.910 --> 02:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
currently are discriminating based on uh
 
02:31:25.510 --> 02:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
their the occupants marital status but
 
02:31:25.520 --> 02:31:27.070 align:start position:0%
their the occupants marital status but
actually

02:31:27.070 --> 02:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:31:30.590 --> 02:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
discriminating just because this is how
 
02:31:31.950 --> 02:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
they want to essentially plan their
 
02:31:34.990 --> 02:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
community and they only want to have the
 
02:31:39.750 --> 02:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
one um or one people in these two two uh
 
02:31:42.750 --> 02:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
family dwelling units they want to add
 
02:31:44.910 --> 02:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
that restriction just as a covenant to
 
02:31:49.389 --> 02:31:49.399 align:start position:0%
some new building um and I think that is
 
02:31:53.710 --> 02:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
just essentially encouraging them to do
 
02:31:57.110 --> 02:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
something like that which I think is
 
02:31:59.910 --> 02:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
kind of moving Us in the wrong direction
 
02:32:05.710 --> 02:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
um I am not 100% sure that this is a net
 
02:32:05.720 --> 02:32:07.750 align:start position:0%
um I am not 100% sure that this is a net
benefit

02:32:07.750 --> 02:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
02:32:13.230 --> 02:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
um just because I think there that the
 
02:32:14.910 --> 02:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
situations that the representative is
 
02:32:17.030 --> 02:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
trying to address those those
 
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
communities would just adopt a like one
 
02:32:24.389 --> 02:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
one occupant per bedroom uh restrictions
 
02:32:26.590 --> 02:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
across the board and I think that would
 
02:32:30.870 --> 02:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
actually be um harmful
 
02:32:34.910 --> 02:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
to families um across the state so I
 
02:32:38.429 --> 02:32:38.439 align:start position:0%
think this is um well-intentioned but I
 
02:32:41.469 --> 02:32:41.479 align:start position:0%
think there may be some negative
 
02:32:43.550 --> 02:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
ramifications representative
 
02:32:46.510 --> 02:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman I agree
 
02:32:49.590 --> 02:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
with my colleague representative ellaa
 
02:32:51.550 --> 02:32:51.560 align:start position:0%
that it does have
 
02:32:51.560 --> 02:32:53.110 align:start position:0%
that it does have
unintended

02:32:53.110 --> 02:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
unintended
 
02:32:56.269 --> 02:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
consequences and even though I believe
 
02:32:59.910 --> 02:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
that the sponsor has tried her best to
 
02:33:04.349 --> 02:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
try to um address the concerns that were
 
02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
raised there's the
 
02:33:06.720 --> 02:33:08.389 align:start position:0%
raised there's the
underlining

02:33:08.389 --> 02:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
underlining
 
02:33:13.550 --> 02:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
um issue of discrimination of unrelated
 
02:33:17.230 --> 02:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
persons that we heard so much about in
 
02:33:19.309 --> 02:33:19.319 align:start position:0%
the hearings and that still isn't
 
02:33:19.319 --> 02:33:21.110 align:start position:0%
the hearings and that still isn't
address

02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:33:24.469 --> 02:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
and secondly I think it's local control
 
02:33:28.030 --> 02:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
that should be regulating the number of
 
02:33:30.750 --> 02:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
persons per
 
02:33:34.670 --> 02:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
bedroom um and in one Community it may
 
02:33:38.110 --> 02:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
make sense if they have the utilities
 
02:33:41.990 --> 02:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
and the resources to handle larger
 
02:33:44.030 --> 02:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
occupancy per
 
02:33:47.710 --> 02:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
houses but in others it may not be like
 
02:33:51.070 --> 02:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
in the case of NASA and in
 
02:33:53.389 --> 02:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
Manchester um so I think it should be
 
02:33:56.070 --> 02:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
left up to the local controls to
 
02:33:59.950 --> 02:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
determine what is best for their
 
02:34:03.309 --> 02:34:03.319 align:start position:0%
communities and with that um I think we
 
02:34:07.630 --> 02:34:07.640 align:start position:0%
should oppose uh this amendment thank
 
02:34:11.630 --> 02:34:11.640 align:start position:0%
you represent maor thank you Mr chairman
 
02:34:13.389 --> 02:34:13.399 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately I'm I'm going to have
 
02:34:15.110 --> 02:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
to oppose the amendment and since the
 
02:34:16.870 --> 02:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
amendment replaces the bill that
 
02:34:19.110 --> 02:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
therefore then um oppose the bill and
 
02:34:21.269 --> 02:34:21.279 align:start position:0%
it's not as my friend representative
 
02:34:23.670 --> 02:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
priest said because I I I don't believe
 
02:34:26.429 --> 02:34:26.439 align:start position:0%
in what the bill was was trying to do
 
02:34:29.510 --> 02:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
the government should not be telling us
 
02:34:31.910 --> 02:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
um about our familiar relationships and
 
02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
and and and how we are living that way
 
02:34:35.510 --> 02:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
they and and on that grounds I think
 
02:34:37.230 --> 02:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is very important but to my
 
02:34:39.910 --> 02:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
friend uh representative Ella I agree
 
02:34:42.110 --> 02:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
the same thing I think that now what's
 
02:34:43.550 --> 02:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
going to happen with this amendment is
 
02:34:45.670 --> 02:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to have one resident per
 
02:34:46.990 --> 02:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
bedroom because that's what the
 
02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
community is going to do it doesn't I
 
02:34:52.190 --> 02:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment doesn't say that the that
 
02:34:54.670 --> 02:34:54.680 align:start position:0%
you shall comply with fire codes it say
 
02:34:57.230 --> 02:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
says you shall not prohibit being on a
 
02:34:59.309 --> 02:34:59.319 align:start position:0%
planning board for 12 years I've seen
 
02:35:01.550 --> 02:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
where parsing of words makes a big
 
02:35:03.990 --> 02:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
difference and if you shall not prohibit
 
02:35:05.790 --> 02:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
it means there will there is a loophole
 
02:35:08.309 --> 02:35:08.319 align:start position:0%
there where somebody may not
 
02:35:11.230 --> 02:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
comply uh I would prefer that that this
 
02:35:14.269 --> 02:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
bill because of its intent to increase
 
02:35:17.790 --> 02:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
affordable housing uh and and eliminate
 
02:35:20.349 --> 02:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
that piece of discrimination or audible
 
02:35:22.030 --> 02:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
I think this should go to interim study
 
02:35:25.349 --> 02:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
so we can fix this but I I think as it
 
02:35:28.269 --> 02:35:28.279 align:start position:0%
is drafted right now it's not there yet
 
02:35:30.309 --> 02:35:30.319 align:start position:0%
and I I do think we can get there and I
 
02:35:32.630 --> 02:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
want to get there but right now I don't
 
02:35:34.710 --> 02:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
think that this B bill can get us where
 
02:35:36.269 --> 02:35:36.279 align:start position:0%
we need thank
 
02:35:39.230 --> 02:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
you further comments representative
 
02:35:42.910 --> 02:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
Gallagher uh so sticking just to the
 
02:35:46.630 --> 02:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
amendment um and trying to um avoid
 
02:35:49.230 --> 02:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
discussion of the underlying bill um
 
02:35:53.389 --> 02:35:53.399 align:start position:0%
yeah I do think that um this amendment
 
02:35:56.670 --> 02:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
attempts to address some of the concerns
 
02:36:01.870 --> 02:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
raised with the original bill um and I
 
02:36:07.349 --> 02:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
think um it's a compromise and um while
 
02:36:10.269 --> 02:36:10.279 align:start position:0%
I probably would have preferred the
 
02:36:13.070 --> 02:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
original Bill if this um amendment makes
 
02:36:15.790 --> 02:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
it more likely to pass then I'd support
 
02:36:20.710 --> 02:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
it um so um as far as um whether it
 
02:36:24.429 --> 02:36:24.439 align:start position:0%
deserves more study or not um I think we
 
02:36:27.110 --> 02:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
can I I think that's a question
 
02:36:29.870 --> 02:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
independent from whether we adopt the
 
02:36:31.990 --> 02:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
amendment or not we can vote to amend
 
02:36:34.110 --> 02:36:34.120 align:start position:0%
the uh um adopt the amendment and then
 
02:36:36.910 --> 02:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
send it to interim study possibly so I
 
02:36:40.710 --> 02:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
am just going to vote to um approve the
 
02:36:42.550 --> 02:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
amendment for
 
02:36:45.469 --> 02:36:45.479 align:start position:0%
now for the
 
02:36:48.429 --> 02:36:48.439 align:start position:0%
comments representative haen Phillips
 
02:36:50.070 --> 02:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:36:52.790 --> 02:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
I I represent Handover and lime and as
 
02:36:54.670 --> 02:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
you know Dartmouth colleges in my
 
02:36:57.110 --> 02:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
districts and we also have a student
 
02:36:59.550 --> 02:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
housing and affordable housing crisis in
 
02:37:04.790 --> 02:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
our community um and I I proface that um
 
02:37:07.550 --> 02:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
the statement with um saying that I'm
 
02:37:10.510 --> 02:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
not sure that this amendment really
 
02:37:12.590 --> 02:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
addresses the issue of trying to
 
02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
increase you know those
 
02:37:18.429 --> 02:37:18.439 align:start position:0%
rental property units across your
 
02:37:20.630 --> 02:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
community with this mandatory language
 
02:37:22.389 --> 02:37:22.399 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll tell you why it's I think
 
02:37:25.429 --> 02:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
um you know our town is much smaller
 
02:37:27.910 --> 02:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
than the durhams and the the plymouths
 
02:37:31.469 --> 02:37:31.479 align:start position:0%
and the KE of the state and our planning
 
02:37:34.030 --> 02:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
board took great expense legal expense
 
02:37:36.110 --> 02:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
and time and resources to try to come up
 
02:37:39.510 --> 02:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
with a solution that met our our kind of
 
02:37:41.790 --> 02:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
rural bubble but high density housing
 
02:37:44.590 --> 02:37:44.600 align:start position:0%
for on campus and off campus student
 
02:37:47.429 --> 02:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
housing to address these needs and you
 
02:37:49.590 --> 02:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
know that response was to create a new
 
02:37:52.429 --> 02:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
higher density zoning district and to
 
02:37:54.269 --> 02:37:54.279 align:start position:0%
redefine what a family is and our
 
02:37:57.830 --> 02:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
ordinances so um you know because of the
 
02:38:01.070 --> 02:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
current enabling statutes for our you
 
02:38:03.910 --> 02:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
know zoning board and planning boards um
 
02:38:07.070 --> 02:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
we were able to meet the challenge um
 
02:38:09.950 --> 02:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
and help solve the immediate you know
 
02:38:12.870 --> 02:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
housing crisis with the past student um
 
02:38:14.870 --> 02:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
calendar year of the students coming to
 
02:38:17.110 --> 02:38:17.120 align:start position:0%
campus without a place to live so I'm
 
02:38:18.670 --> 02:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
just saying that I do believe there are
 
02:38:21.510 --> 02:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
tools that are available to each of our
 
02:38:23.590 --> 02:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
communities um and that each of our
 
02:38:25.469 --> 02:38:25.479 align:start position:0%
communities have the ability to address
 
02:38:28.190 --> 02:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
them in the way that's best seen fit so
 
02:38:30.870 --> 02:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
I really do think that the way the
 
02:38:34.469 --> 02:38:34.479 align:start position:0%
current statues exist um provide that
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
local control which is such an important
 
02:38:40.429 --> 02:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
piece of how we govern ourselves and of
 
02:38:42.070 --> 02:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
course while I agree that you know the
 
02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
housing crisis challenge is meeting all
 
02:38:47.510 --> 02:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
of us you know at different spots across
 
02:38:49.469 --> 02:38:49.479 align:start position:0%
the state it is an overwhelming issue
 
02:38:52.110 --> 02:38:52.120 align:start position:0%
issue and that as many tools as we can
 
02:38:55.190 --> 02:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
create to try to tackle that um is
 
02:38:57.710 --> 02:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
important I'm just not sure that the
 
02:38:59.990 --> 02:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory language here is going to be
 
02:39:02.030 --> 02:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
able to get each Community across the
 
02:39:05.710 --> 02:39:05.720 align:start position:0%
state to that finish line um I think
 
02:39:06.990 --> 02:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
that you're going to run into a lot of
 
02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:08.510 align:start position:0%
that you're going to run into a lot of
unintended

02:39:08.510 --> 02:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
unintended
 
02:39:10.790 --> 02:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
consequences um and I I am mostly
 
02:39:13.750 --> 02:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about the you know the one
 
02:39:16.230 --> 02:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
occupant per room and defining who a
 
02:39:17.990 --> 02:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
family is I think there are
 
02:39:20.150 --> 02:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
several you know discriminatory and
 
02:39:21.590 --> 02:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
civil rights issues that still need to
 
02:39:24.550 --> 02:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
be fleshed out so I would agree with um
 
02:39:26.389 --> 02:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
representative majori that you know
 
02:39:28.030 --> 02:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
interim study May provide a better
 
02:39:31.030 --> 02:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to hear maybe even from the
 
02:39:33.469 --> 02:39:33.479 align:start position:0%
housing um special committee on housing
 
02:39:37.070 --> 02:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
members to see where they fall um in
 
02:39:39.750 --> 02:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
line with this as well um so more voices
 
02:39:43.389 --> 02:39:43.399 align:start position:0%
can participate in that discussion so
 
02:39:47.550 --> 02:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you further
 
02:39:50.910 --> 02:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
comments representative power
 
02:39:53.269 --> 02:39:53.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I I would like
 
02:39:57.349 --> 02:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
to respond to a previous comment here
 
02:40:01.389 --> 02:40:01.399 align:start position:0%
with regards to um the state building
 
02:40:03.630 --> 02:40:03.640 align:start position:0%
and State Fire codes I I found that
 
02:40:06.469 --> 02:40:06.479 align:start position:0%
comment somewhat confusing because it
 
02:40:09.670 --> 02:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
goes without saying that those um the
 
02:40:11.710 --> 02:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
state building code and the state fire
 
02:40:15.550 --> 02:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
code shall be followed that's the law
 
02:40:18.309 --> 02:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
and furthermore the wording in this
 
02:40:21.349 --> 02:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
amendment says nothing because there was
 
02:40:23.630 --> 02:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
concern before that the the bill as
 
02:40:26.510 --> 02:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
introduced broke things and that oh you
 
02:40:28.630 --> 02:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
know building codes and fire codes would
 
02:40:30.550 --> 02:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
not be able to be enforced so that's why
 
02:40:33.230 --> 02:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
I put this specific language in that
 
02:40:36.349 --> 02:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
made it abundantly clear that
 
02:40:39.590 --> 02:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
nothing in this section and and let me
 
02:40:42.389 --> 02:40:42.399 align:start position:0%
note that this is under um rental
 
02:40:44.590 --> 02:40:44.600 align:start position:0%
occupancy so nothing in the section
 
02:40:47.070 --> 02:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
shall prohibit the enforcement of the
 
02:40:49.870 --> 02:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
State Building or fire code so that that
 
02:40:52.870 --> 02:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
was confusing and the other thing that I
 
02:40:56.550 --> 02:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:00.990 --> 02:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
that in the course of time when
 
02:41:04.110 --> 02:41:04.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities are overreaching and
 
02:41:07.950 --> 02:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
going Beyond in in in adopting
 
02:41:07.960 --> 02:41:10.590 align:start position:0%
going Beyond in in in adopting
ordinances

02:41:10.590 --> 02:41:10.600 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
02:41:14.269 --> 02:41:14.279 align:start position:0%
that are are violations in overreaches
 
02:41:16.349 --> 02:41:16.359 align:start position:0%
of the authority that the this
 
02:41:18.110 --> 02:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
legislature has given them it's
 
02:41:21.150 --> 02:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon the legislature when we
 
02:41:23.590 --> 02:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
see those violations when we see those
 
02:41:27.429 --> 02:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
abuses to step in to look to observe to
 
02:41:30.349 --> 02:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
analyze and say what you are doing in
 
02:41:32.950 --> 02:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
your M municipality through your zoning
 
02:41:36.309 --> 02:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
ordinances it's it's wrong this is a
 
02:41:39.630 --> 02:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
Dylan's rule state and municipalities
 
02:41:41.710 --> 02:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
are given the power and the authority to
 
02:41:43.269 --> 02:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
do certain
 
02:41:46.750 --> 02:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
things and when they they they take
 
02:41:49.830 --> 02:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
advantage of that they
 
02:41:52.950 --> 02:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
overreach and they cause
 
02:41:57.190 --> 02:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
problems like I said we as legislators
 
02:42:01.750 --> 02:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
must take note and must take action and
 
02:42:03.349 --> 02:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
this is one of these
 
02:42:08.230 --> 02:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
times it's very clear that ordinances
 
02:42:10.910 --> 02:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
that that leave housing
 
02:42:14.910 --> 02:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities empty vacant for no good
 
02:42:18.710 --> 02:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
reason is a problem it is contributing
 
02:42:22.990 --> 02:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
to the housing crisis here in our state
 
02:42:26.150 --> 02:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
and if we choose to do nothing to kick
 
02:42:29.510 --> 02:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
this can down the road we are part of
 
02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:31.389 align:start position:0%
this can down the road we are part of
the

02:42:31.389 --> 02:42:31.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:42:31.399 --> 02:42:33.790 align:start position:0%
the
problem

02:42:33.790 --> 02:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:42:37.870 --> 02:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
and I see this as a serious
 
02:42:41.630 --> 02:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
concern this is why I filed this
 
02:42:46.030 --> 02:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
bill and I would appreciate it if others
 
02:42:51.030 --> 02:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
here would recognize the Injustice that
 
02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:52.590 align:start position:0%
here would recognize the Injustice that
is

02:42:52.590 --> 02:42:52.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:43:00.630 --> 02:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:02.870 --> 02:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
wrong I'll just leave it at that thank
 
02:43:06.030 --> 02:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman representative kahill
 
02:43:08.670 --> 02:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um so we do we do
 
02:43:09.910 --> 02:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
have someone on the special housing
 
02:43:12.469 --> 02:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
committee sitting sitting right here um
 
02:43:16.510 --> 02:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
and we all recognize that we need to do
 
02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:17.630 align:start position:0%
and we all recognize that we need to do
things

02:43:17.630 --> 02:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:43:19.910 --> 02:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
to um
 
02:43:22.550 --> 02:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
work to mitigate our how housing problem
 
02:43:27.070 --> 02:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
um these are not easy solutions um but I
 
02:43:29.309 --> 02:43:29.319 align:start position:0%
recognize that there's enough concerns
 
02:43:31.269 --> 02:43:31.279 align:start position:0%
being raised by some of our colleagues
 
02:43:33.349 --> 02:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
here today that I would tend to agree
 
02:43:35.870 --> 02:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
that um possibly an interim study with
 
02:43:38.750 --> 02:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
that representative majori has suggested
 
02:43:41.269 --> 02:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
would be the way to
 
02:43:47.030 --> 02:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
go rep uh repes representative
 
02:43:50.070 --> 02:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
spere thank you uh I take a little bit
 
02:43:52.550 --> 02:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
of an exception to saying for no good
 
02:43:56.389 --> 02:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
reason as I said before in very dense
 
02:43:58.230 --> 02:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
communities like the ones I live like
 
02:44:01.309 --> 02:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
the one I live in and I represent it is
 
02:44:04.190 --> 02:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
very dense we have housing on rental
 
02:44:06.630 --> 02:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
properties actually on properties as
 
02:44:09.030 --> 02:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
small as a little bit larger than 1/8 of
 
02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:10.230 align:start position:0%
small as a little bit larger than 1/8 of
an

02:44:10.230 --> 02:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:44:12.870 --> 02:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
acre uh we have streets that we
 
02:44:15.750 --> 02:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
literally have to hand plow we cannot
 
02:44:18.510 --> 02:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
bring a plow down those streets we have
 
02:44:21.030 --> 02:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
streets that we've been uh upgrading
 
02:44:23.110 --> 02:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
because we can't get fire trucks down
 
02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:24.389 align:start position:0%
because we can't get fire trucks down
those

02:44:24.389 --> 02:44:24.399 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:44:27.349 --> 02:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
streets uh as you probably have read in
 
02:44:31.590 --> 02:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
the news we are both Manchester and uh
 
02:44:34.590 --> 02:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
nsha are in are not in compliance with
 
02:44:38.030 --> 02:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
the EPA and the fact that we've dumped
 
02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
20 million pounds of waste into the
 
02:44:44.070 --> 02:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
miramac river and into the nashille
 
02:44:47.590 --> 02:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
river so there are very good reasons for
 
02:44:50.550 --> 02:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
not increasing the density of some of
 
02:44:53.750 --> 02:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
these towns as far as deciding what a
 
02:44:56.269 --> 02:44:56.279 align:start position:0%
family is we have no right to step into
 
02:44:57.990 --> 02:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
that and then that needs to be fixed if
 
02:45:00.469 --> 02:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
communities are doing that sort of thing
 
02:45:02.590 --> 02:45:02.600 align:start position:0%
but the idea of just saying willy-nilly
 
02:45:05.389 --> 02:45:05.399 align:start position:0%
we're just going to increase the density
 
02:45:09.510 --> 02:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
in areas that cannot afford to do that
 
02:45:12.630 --> 02:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
that is also very bad so I think we have
 
02:45:14.309 --> 02:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
to be very careful where we're doing
 
02:45:16.590 --> 02:45:16.600 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
02:45:19.550 --> 02:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chairman initially I
 
02:45:21.910 --> 02:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
was in total agreement with the author
 
02:45:24.389 --> 02:45:24.399 align:start position:0%
of this amendment um I've thought about
 
02:45:27.510 --> 02:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
it uh quite a bit uh I've listened to
 
02:45:30.510 --> 02:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
the testimony of my peers here and as a
 
02:45:33.150 --> 02:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
result of that although I I think it's
 
02:45:34.469 --> 02:45:34.479 align:start position:0%
well intentioned what we're trying to do
 
02:45:36.510 --> 02:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to ad just address the
 
02:45:40.030 --> 02:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
housing crisis I would agree with my per
 
02:45:42.349 --> 02:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
to my left that uh we should possibly
 
02:45:44.469 --> 02:45:44.479 align:start position:0%
look at interim study to address this
 
02:45:46.469 --> 02:45:46.479 align:start position:0%
since uh we don't seem to be able to get
 
02:45:50.550 --> 02:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
to consensus on it here thank you
 
02:45:53.550 --> 02:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
further comments representative
 
02:45:56.630 --> 02:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
yella thank you
 
02:45:58.410 --> 02:45:58.420 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
02:45:58.420 --> 02:45:59.750 align:start position:0%
um I think
[Music]

02:45:59.750 --> 02:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:46:05.230 --> 02:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
that the sponsor of this legislation has
 
02:46:09.429 --> 02:46:09.439 align:start position:0%
drafted many amendments
 
02:46:14.150 --> 02:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
um um and I believe
 
02:46:20.830 --> 02:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
that um these that focusing on
 
02:46:23.269 --> 02:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
discrimination and ending the
 
02:46:27.550 --> 02:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
Discrimination seems to be from both
 
02:46:29.790 --> 02:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
sides to be an
 
02:46:34.910 --> 02:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
important um issue while
 
02:46:39.429 --> 02:46:39.439 align:start position:0%
still um not saying that you can't you
 
02:46:43.389 --> 02:46:43.399 align:start position:0%
you can do other things as far as
 
02:46:47.190 --> 02:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
limiting um if if there's a need within
 
02:46:49.550 --> 02:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
the community or there's a um there's a
 
02:46:52.870 --> 02:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
capacity issue that you might have um
 
02:46:56.910 --> 02:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
other ways of of limiting but not
 
02:46:59.790 --> 02:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
through dis discrimination I believe
 
02:47:04.950 --> 02:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
that um such an amendment could be um
 
02:47:09.950 --> 02:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
drafted in the time um before this this
 
02:47:13.429 --> 02:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
bill is is required to be out and so I
 
02:47:19.910 --> 02:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
think that um I would not support um uh
 
02:47:21.469 --> 02:47:21.479 align:start position:0%
this amendment but I think that we
 
02:47:23.670 --> 02:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
should allow this the additional
 
02:47:26.190 --> 02:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
amendments to be drafted um before the
 
02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:27.950 align:start position:0%
amendments to be drafted um before the
20th

02:47:27.950 --> 02:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
20th
 
02:47:30.510 --> 02:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
um and brought brought to this committee
 
02:47:33.030 --> 02:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
and and and not do interim study before
 
02:47:36.030 --> 02:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
then so thank you further
 
02:47:38.230 --> 02:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
comments okay I'm going to take my turn
 
02:47:41.590 --> 02:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
then representative power you can go
 
02:47:44.910 --> 02:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
um this bill uh the amendment as well
 
02:47:46.269 --> 02:47:46.279 align:start position:0%
since we're talking about the amendment
 
02:47:47.550 --> 02:47:47.560 align:start position:0%
everybody's talking about the bill I'm
 
02:47:49.030 --> 02:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
going to talk about the bill as as a
 
02:47:52.590 --> 02:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
whole both of them in my estimation are
 
02:47:54.750 --> 02:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
unacceptable simply for the well
 
02:47:57.030 --> 02:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
multiple facts but the main
 
02:47:59.710 --> 02:47:59.720 align:start position:0%
overriding issue here is like so many
 
02:48:01.830 --> 02:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
bills we're hearing and that's the
 
02:48:04.950 --> 02:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
Mandate versus the local control issue
 
02:48:08.710 --> 02:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
this is exactly another one we've heard
 
02:48:12.990 --> 02:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
um we've heard from durm planners the
 
02:48:14.710 --> 02:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
administrator the Town Council we've
 
02:48:18.030 --> 02:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
heard from Manchester mayor Ru uh Ru
 
02:48:19.950 --> 02:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
called me and said they were against it
 
02:48:21.710 --> 02:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
heard from the Lebanon City Manager the
 
02:48:24.630 --> 02:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
Plymouth Town manager the Keen uh
 
02:48:27.110 --> 02:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
development of uh director of
 
02:48:29.990 --> 02:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
development city manager fire chief all
 
02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:30.790 align:start position:0%
development city manager fire chief all
these

02:48:30.790 --> 02:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:48:32.950 --> 02:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
individuals have contacted this
 
02:48:35.790 --> 02:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
committee and there's
 
02:48:38.870 --> 02:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
a common theme amongst those most of
 
02:48:42.990 --> 02:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
them all have to do with uh College uh
 
02:48:44.590 --> 02:48:44.600 align:start position:0%
or university
 
02:48:48.429 --> 02:48:48.439 align:start position:0%
towns um the issue of whether or not
 
02:48:51.309 --> 02:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
we're overreaching or not that that's an
 
02:48:54.389 --> 02:48:54.399 align:start position:0%
opinion but it's the town has the de
 
02:48:56.950 --> 02:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
makes the decision on zoning that's what
 
02:48:58.630 --> 02:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
we've delegated to the
 
02:49:02.190 --> 02:49:02.200 align:start position:0%
towns um the town can make bad decisions
 
02:49:06.190 --> 02:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
they can make good con good decisions um
 
02:49:08.710 --> 02:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
and it they'll suffer the effects or the
 
02:49:11.070 --> 02:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
bonuses of that but that's up to the the
 
02:49:11.080 --> 02:49:12.550 align:start position:0%
bonuses of that but that's up to the the
M

02:49:12.550 --> 02:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
M
 
02:49:15.950 --> 02:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh to do this um you know
 
02:49:17.710 --> 02:49:17.720 align:start position:0%
I don't want to get into
 
02:49:19.990 --> 02:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
the what I believe is really the
 
02:49:22.830 --> 02:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
underlying reason for this for this the
 
02:49:25.110 --> 02:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
main bill and the continuing on
 
02:49:26.670 --> 02:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment but a couple of the
 
02:49:29.469 --> 02:49:29.479 align:start position:0%
individuals that testified here I'm not
 
02:49:31.190 --> 02:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
going to go down that road right now if
 
02:49:35.670 --> 02:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
we need to later I will um but when we
 
02:49:40.910 --> 02:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
throw a mandate down on a Town not only
 
02:49:43.830 --> 02:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
do while the attempt is to protect one
 
02:49:45.389 --> 02:49:45.399 align:start position:0%
person's property
 
02:49:48.389 --> 02:49:48.399 align:start position:0%
rights you're taking away the other
 
02:49:50.950 --> 02:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
person 's property rights the next door
 
02:49:53.269 --> 02:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
neighbor or whoever who has moved in or
 
02:49:56.030 --> 02:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
bought or whatever in that locality they
 
02:49:56.040 --> 02:49:56.990 align:start position:0%
bought or whatever in that locality they
buy

02:49:56.990 --> 02:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
buy
 
02:50:00.590 --> 02:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
in um for a reason
 
02:50:04.670 --> 02:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
knowing what the zoning is or at least
 
02:50:06.910 --> 02:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
you should know one of the individuals
 
02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
who testified
 
02:50:12.269 --> 02:50:12.279 align:start position:0%
here um who's in favor of this
 
02:50:15.269 --> 02:50:15.279 align:start position:0%
that when I asked him when you bought
 
02:50:18.030 --> 02:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
your first rental property there were
 
02:50:20.070 --> 02:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
you aware of the zoning and he said no
 
02:50:22.309 --> 02:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
my realtor didn't tell me Well between
 
02:50:24.309 --> 02:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
you and I that's caveat
 
02:50:26.429 --> 02:50:26.439 align:start position:0%
mtor I don't think the realtor is
 
02:50:28.349 --> 02:50:28.359 align:start position:0%
responsible for laying out exactly what
 
02:50:31.590 --> 02:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
the zoning is and then I asked him I
 
02:50:33.710 --> 02:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
said didn't you buy more rental
 
02:50:36.229 --> 02:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
properties yes well if he was already
 
02:50:38.590 --> 02:50:38.600 align:start position:0%
aware of the problems in what he
 
02:50:40.630 --> 02:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
considered problems in the town of durm
 
02:50:42.830 --> 02:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
why did he continue to you know purchase
 
02:50:47.429 --> 02:50:47.439 align:start position:0%
F the properties so um it it appears to
 
02:50:49.550 --> 02:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
me and I spoke
 
02:50:51.750 --> 02:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
very shortly after our first hearing uh
 
02:50:53.870 --> 02:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
hearing with Vice chairman power about
 
02:50:55.990 --> 02:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
this that I saw this this was uh
 
02:50:57.670 --> 02:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
individuals who are having issues with
 
02:50:59.870 --> 02:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
the town of durm who were trying to have
 
02:51:05.429 --> 02:51:05.439 align:start position:0%
us solve solve their issues um the durm
 
02:51:09.190 --> 02:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
has already at least once and if uh rep
 
02:51:10.710 --> 02:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
Howen was here he could probably be a
 
02:51:14.190 --> 02:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
little bit more educ educate us a little
 
02:51:15.950 --> 02:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
bit more on this
 
02:51:19.590 --> 02:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
but have been taken to court over over
 
02:51:23.710 --> 02:51:23.720 align:start position:0%
the their zoning that was put in in the
 
02:51:26.229 --> 02:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
1980s and they won the courts
 
02:51:27.910 --> 02:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
adjudicated and said yes what you're
 
02:51:31.750 --> 02:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
doing is okay so I I just again the
 
02:51:33.950 --> 02:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
overriding thing for me is mandate
 
02:51:36.630 --> 02:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
versus local I don't think it's um that
 
02:51:39.469 --> 02:51:39.479 align:start position:0%
we have the ability or should we do have
 
02:51:42.110 --> 02:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
the ability but we should not be forcing
 
02:51:45.990 --> 02:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
towns to do uh do one thing or another
 
02:51:47.910 --> 02:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
and I would also I know we're not on
 
02:51:49.910 --> 02:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
that subject but I would also be opposed
 
02:51:53.550 --> 02:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
to interim study on that um so that's
 
02:51:55.750 --> 02:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
what I have to say represent
 
02:51:58.429 --> 02:51:58.439 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman so I would
 
02:52:03.190 --> 02:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
just um respond with reference to the
 
02:52:06.190 --> 02:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
um I guess groups of people that you
 
02:52:09.469 --> 02:52:09.479 align:start position:0%
have listed those are in fact people
 
02:52:11.870 --> 02:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
from the municipalities based on my
 
02:52:15.030 --> 02:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
research that I shared with this
 
02:52:17.349 --> 02:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
committee they represent the
 
02:52:19.550 --> 02:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities that that in fact have
 
02:52:22.150 --> 02:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
these artificially
 
02:52:24.670 --> 02:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
in restrictive
 
02:52:27.229 --> 02:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
ordinances so the other thing that I
 
02:52:30.229 --> 02:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
would like to say is based on um the
 
02:52:32.070 --> 02:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
comments here during the executive
 
02:52:35.110 --> 02:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
session that I would respectfully ask
 
02:52:40.309 --> 02:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
that um this bill be pushed until
 
02:52:44.670 --> 02:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
um the the 20th of March as we have
 
02:52:47.750 --> 02:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
pushed other bills here that have come
 
02:52:50.429 --> 02:52:50.439 align:start position:0%
before us
 
02:52:55.670 --> 02:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
because I um have in fact drafted a
 
02:52:58.870 --> 02:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
number of versions of amendments so that
 
02:53:01.590 --> 02:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
they're available and like I explained
 
02:53:04.269 --> 02:53:04.279 align:start position:0%
previously this was the amendment that
 
02:53:07.870 --> 02:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
that I felt based on my conversations
 
02:53:11.229 --> 02:53:11.239 align:start position:0%
with individuals this would have had the
 
02:53:14.590 --> 02:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
best chance to move forward um but based
 
02:53:17.469 --> 02:53:17.479 align:start position:0%
on the feedback um I would like the
 
02:53:20.150 --> 02:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be able to
 
02:53:22.670 --> 02:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
introduce some of my other amendments
 
02:53:22.680 --> 02:53:24.750 align:start position:0%
introduce some of my other amendments
thank

02:53:24.750 --> 02:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:53:28.550 --> 02:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
you represent gallager um and on the
 
02:53:30.910 --> 02:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
topic of other amendments I'd also note
 
02:53:34.190 --> 02:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
that um representative howand had his
 
02:53:37.510 --> 02:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
own separate Amendment um I forget the
 
02:53:41.110 --> 02:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
exact number of it um that I think is
 
02:53:44.070 --> 02:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
worth um considering as well but um
 
02:53:46.950 --> 02:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
since he's couldn't be with us here
 
02:53:50.710 --> 02:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
today that um that' be another reason
 
02:53:54.590 --> 02:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
for um waiting until he can have a
 
02:53:59.030 --> 02:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
chance to introduce it himself and um
 
02:54:03.990 --> 02:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
tell us about um his idea behind
 
02:54:06.110 --> 02:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
it forther comments representative
 
02:54:09.349 --> 02:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
majori thank you Mr chairman I'm I'm I
 
02:54:10.590 --> 02:54:10.600 align:start position:0%
think I was the one who first suggested
 
02:54:12.710 --> 02:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
an interim study I'm not sure based on
 
02:54:14.229 --> 02:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
what I've heard that interim study is
 
02:54:17.070 --> 02:54:17.080 align:start position:0%
even going to be the right choice here I
 
02:54:19.309 --> 02:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
mean just sitting here I'm based on what
 
02:54:21.950 --> 02:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
I've heard Hanover probably should be
 
02:54:24.269 --> 02:54:24.279 align:start position:0%
consulted what did you do you know and
 
02:54:27.229 --> 02:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
how did you do it uh the ACLU probably
 
02:54:29.950 --> 02:54:29.960 align:start position:0%
should be consulted about the issue of
 
02:54:32.710 --> 02:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
discrimination uh the courts I I'm I'm
 
02:54:35.870 --> 02:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
starting to wonder now I I this bill is
 
02:54:37.750 --> 02:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely well intended and will do
 
02:54:39.150 --> 02:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
good things I just don't think it's
 
02:54:40.830 --> 02:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time right now and
 
02:54:43.389 --> 02:54:43.399 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that may mean that may
 
02:54:46.150 --> 02:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
mean it has to go to itl so that we can
 
02:54:47.990 --> 02:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
draft something that's or something that
 
02:54:49.950 --> 02:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
better can be drafted that's more
 
02:54:51.910 --> 02:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive I don't think this is a
 
02:54:53.429 --> 02:54:53.439 align:start position:0%
bad Bill or a bad I don't think it's a
 
02:54:55.950 --> 02:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
bad idea thank
 
02:54:59.910 --> 02:54:59.920 align:start position:0%

14 okay that motion fails representative
 
02:56:43.630 --> 02:56:43.640 align:start position:0%
majority do you have a further motion Mr
 
02:56:47.150 --> 02:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
chairman um regrettably I move itl do we
 
02:56:49.550 --> 02:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
have a second representative K uh
 
02:56:55.389 --> 02:56:55.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:58.630 --> 02:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
St I'm assuming since we discussed the
 
02:57:01.670 --> 02:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
Whole Thing Once the further
 
02:57:04.309 --> 02:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
comments about the
 
02:57:09.070 --> 02:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
bill representative gallager um
 
02:57:13.349 --> 02:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
so uh I I previously tried to keep my
 
02:57:15.990 --> 02:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
comments just to the amendment and now
 
02:57:19.630 --> 02:57:19.640 align:start position:0%
since the amendment has not been adopted
 
02:57:21.510 --> 02:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
um I think there are actually additional
 
02:57:23.190 --> 02:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
things to talk about
 
02:57:27.950 --> 02:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
um with the underlying bill um yeah I
 
02:57:32.389 --> 02:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
think the underlying bill is a good idea
 
02:57:36.710 --> 02:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
um and that um yeah a lot of the cause
 
02:57:38.710 --> 02:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
of the housing crisis is zonning
 
02:57:42.990 --> 02:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions like these um that
 
02:57:45.870 --> 02:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities Institute and that nimes
 
02:57:50.630 --> 02:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
will um take advantage of to prevent
 
02:57:53.990 --> 02:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
people from moving in um I to respond to
 
02:57:55.910 --> 02:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
some of the other points I think I also
 
02:57:58.910 --> 02:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
represent a very dense District um
 
02:58:02.510 --> 02:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
conquered w six which is just down the
 
02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
street and that's one of the things I
 
02:58:08.150 --> 02:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
love about it is how dense it is um
 
02:58:10.429 --> 02:58:10.439 align:start position:0%
density provides for walkability it
 
02:58:12.389 --> 02:58:12.399 align:start position:0%
means there's all sorts of businesses
 
02:58:14.990 --> 02:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
and other people living around that I
 
02:58:16.590 --> 02:58:16.600 align:start position:0%
can interact with I don't even have to
 
02:58:18.750 --> 02:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
own a car um
 
02:58:21.990 --> 02:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
just because I can I I I really love the
 
02:58:23.429 --> 02:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
fact that I'm able to walk here every
 
02:58:24.790 --> 02:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
day and I think more people should be
 
02:58:27.510 --> 02:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
able to have opportunities like that um
 
02:58:32.150 --> 02:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
that are brought by density and um as a
 
02:58:35.910 --> 02:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
renter myself I would object to the
 
02:58:39.269 --> 02:58:39.279 align:start position:0%
claim that renters somehow care less
 
02:58:42.910 --> 02:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
about their living space than Property
 
02:58:47.190 --> 02:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
Owners do um you know it's it's still
 
02:58:50.429 --> 02:58:50.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:53.590 --> 02:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
like you know if if you if you make a
 
02:58:55.190 --> 02:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
mess of your living space you still have
 
02:58:58.670 --> 02:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
to live with it yourself um
 
02:59:01.510 --> 02:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah I
 
02:59:04.469 --> 02:59:04.479 align:start position:0%
um I I think this bill
 
02:59:08.910 --> 02:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
is a good idea and I'll be opposing the
 
02:59:10.630 --> 02:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
itl motion on
 
02:59:13.510 --> 02:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
it for the
 
02:59:13.520 --> 02:59:15.070 align:start position:0%
it for the
comment

02:59:15.070 --> 02:59:15.080 align:start position:0%
comment
 
02:59:18.550 --> 02:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
Kell yes thank you just because I uh did
 
02:59:20.190 --> 02:59:20.200 align:start position:0%
not support the amendment does not mean
 
02:59:22.950 --> 02:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
I didn't don't support the bill the bill
 
02:59:29.070 --> 02:59:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh even unamended I support and um
 
02:59:32.750 --> 02:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
believe that that the Discrimination by
 
02:59:37.389 --> 02:59:37.399 align:start position:0%
some municipalities is um unwarranted
 
02:59:41.110 --> 02:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
and they're utilizing the
 
02:59:42.910 --> 02:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:59:45.550 --> 02:59:45.560 align:start position:0%
flexibility that the that the state has
 
02:59:49.550 --> 02:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
given to override uh uh the property
 
02:59:53.229 --> 02:59:53.239 align:start position:0%
rights of the people um and I have to
 
02:59:54.790 --> 02:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
disagree with the
 
03:00:00.469 --> 03:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
representative uh that you buy into the
 
03:00:04.030 --> 03:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
regulations that you are placed under
 
03:00:07.030 --> 03:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
when you buy the home um if that was the
 
03:00:09.269 --> 03:00:09.279 align:start position:0%
case we would never be able to amend
 
03:00:12.030 --> 03:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
zoning um I think
 
03:00:16.070 --> 03:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
that there is additional issues as far
 
03:00:18.910 --> 03:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
as that that
 
03:00:21.309 --> 03:00:21.319 align:start position:0%
um the
 
03:00:24.190 --> 03:00:24.200 align:start position:0%
people uh that there are other ways to
 
03:00:26.750 --> 03:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
address you know everyone in the whole
 
03:00:29.830 --> 03:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
state has to abide by the state fire
 
03:00:34.070 --> 03:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
code that is a state mandate right and
 
03:00:34.080 --> 03:00:35.750 align:start position:0%
code that is a state mandate right and
so

03:00:35.750 --> 03:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:00:39.110 --> 03:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's I think that some people are like
 
03:00:41.389 --> 03:00:41.399 align:start position:0%
wanting to pick and choose what the
 
03:00:45.229 --> 03:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
state is is mandating and what is not
 
03:00:48.670 --> 03:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
being mandated by by the state but in
 
03:00:53.070 --> 03:00:53.080 align:start position:0%
fact when we see abuses that it is AC
 
03:00:57.630 --> 03:00:57.640 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon us to write those abuses
 
03:01:01.150 --> 03:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
um and I've you know given examples of
 
03:01:04.429 --> 03:01:04.439 align:start position:0%
of municipalities abuses in in other
 
03:01:07.389 --> 03:01:07.399 align:start position:0%
ways than just zoning to this this
 
03:01:11.710 --> 03:01:11.720 align:start position:0%
committee before and I think that all of
 
03:01:15.030 --> 03:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
those are are things that we need to be
 
03:01:18.790 --> 03:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
consider consideration uh considering of
 
03:01:20.670 --> 03:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
when we are saying like oh we should
 
03:01:24.190 --> 03:01:24.200 align:start position:0%
just let the local tyranny run run ramp
 
03:01:27.030 --> 03:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
it and so that's why I'm going to be
 
03:01:30.910 --> 03:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
voting uh against the um itail motion
 
03:01:33.229 --> 03:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
thank you further comments
 
03:01:33.239 --> 03:01:35.750 align:start position:0%
thank you further comments
representative

03:01:35.750 --> 03:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:38.950 --> 03:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
Brown you go to him
 
03:01:40.910 --> 03:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
first you're recognized go ahead
 
03:01:43.229 --> 03:01:43.239 align:start position:0%
represent thanks Mr chairman I guess uh
 
03:01:45.510 --> 03:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
my question is there was a discussion a
 
03:01:47.630 --> 03:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
few minutes ago about uh the ability of
 
03:01:50.469 --> 03:01:50.479 align:start position:0%
push this bill back to the 20th uh
 
03:01:52.630 --> 03:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
before the motion was made was that is
 
03:01:55.670 --> 03:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
that something that we can still
 
03:01:58.429 --> 03:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
consider the current motion on the table
 
03:02:02.070 --> 03:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
is itail once this is completed you can
 
03:02:04.630 --> 03:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
see okay that's what I want to know
 
03:02:06.030 --> 03:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
thank you AB
 
03:02:09.830 --> 03:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
PRI thank you Mr chairman um I would uh
 
03:02:12.870 --> 03:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
be oppos I would be in support of the
 
03:02:15.550 --> 03:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
itl because I don't think the bill is
 
03:02:19.349 --> 03:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time I think think um
 
03:02:22.590 --> 03:02:22.600 align:start position:0%
restricting the occupants to two
 
03:02:26.790 --> 03:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
occupants per bedroom is again a mandate
 
03:02:28.590 --> 03:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
and it should be left to the local
 
03:02:31.150 --> 03:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
control to determine whether or not they
 
03:02:34.389 --> 03:02:34.399 align:start position:0%
have the resources and the desire and
 
03:02:39.030 --> 03:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
the need to do that and then it does
 
03:02:42.990 --> 03:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
address the unrelated um issue the
 
03:02:45.070 --> 03:02:45.080 align:start position:0%
discriminatory fact that we've had in
 
03:02:48.229 --> 03:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
our regulations and I appreciate that
 
03:02:51.510 --> 03:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't really address that these
 
03:02:54.630 --> 03:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
regulations should be in compliance with
 
03:02:56.030 --> 03:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
the life and
 
03:02:56.040 --> 03:02:57.950 align:start position:0%
the life and
safety

03:02:57.950 --> 03:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
safety
 
03:03:03.670 --> 03:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
um codes of our um safety and fire codes
 
03:03:06.550 --> 03:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
so and again this can be addressed by
 
03:03:10.190 --> 03:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
redrafting this thank you forther
 
03:03:12.389 --> 03:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
comments representative maor thank you
 
03:03:15.429 --> 03:03:15.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um to the underlying bill I
 
03:03:17.229 --> 03:03:17.239 align:start position:0%
I I made the motion so I certainly can't
 
03:03:18.510 --> 03:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
support it but
 
03:03:19.870 --> 03:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
again sitting on a planning board
 
03:03:21.670 --> 03:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
sitting on on a select board I've seen
 
03:03:24.590 --> 03:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
how people abuse things and when I see
 
03:03:27.030 --> 03:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
language that says shall not adopt nor
 
03:03:29.990 --> 03:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
enforce any code ordinance bylaw or
 
03:03:32.309 --> 03:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
regulation it there could be a period
 
03:03:33.750 --> 03:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
right there because that's the way
 
03:03:35.349 --> 03:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
people would read it it doesn't matter
 
03:03:37.429 --> 03:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
what it says after that people will take
 
03:03:40.030 --> 03:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
that language and they will they will
 
03:03:42.670 --> 03:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
say you cannot adopt any code any
 
03:03:46.790 --> 03:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
ordinance any bylaw period that needs to
 
03:03:49.349 --> 03:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
be addressed again we'll keep saying it
 
03:03:51.150 --> 03:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
it can be addressed I think it can be
 
03:03:52.910 --> 03:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
addressed and we can get to a good place
 
03:03:55.389 --> 03:03:55.399 align:start position:0%
but this bill as drafted is not ready
 
03:03:57.590 --> 03:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
for Prime Time thank you further

P thank you Mr chairman and in response
 
03:04:05.389 --> 03:04:05.399 align:start position:0%
to my colleagues comments that's exactly
 
03:04:08.750 --> 03:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
why I put forward an amendment based on
 
03:04:10.950 --> 03:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
feedback from the bill hearing and
 
03:04:13.990 --> 03:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
furthermore that's exactly why I have
 
03:04:16.750 --> 03:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
three other versions of an amendment
 
03:04:20.190 --> 03:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
drafted and moreover that's exactly why
 
03:04:22.990 --> 03:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
I asked that this bill be pushed to the
 
03:04:25.349 --> 03:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
20th but apparently there's no will for
 
03:04:29.469 --> 03:04:29.479 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr chairman further
 
03:04:32.389 --> 03:04:32.399 align:start position:0%

04:15:05.910 --> 04:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
Quasi judicial nature of local planning
 
04:15:10.510 --> 04:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
boards um I can tell you that the term
 
04:15:10.520 --> 04:15:11.590 align:start position:0%
boards um I can tell you that the term
quasi

04:15:11.590 --> 04:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
quasi
 
04:15:14.670 --> 04:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
judicial is not defined
 
04:15:18.189 --> 04:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
anywhere and the average person doesn't
 
04:15:19.590 --> 04:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
know what it
 
04:15:24.109 --> 04:15:24.119 align:start position:0%
means so I went to the
 
04:15:24.119 --> 04:15:25.670 align:start position:0%
means so I went to the
dictionary

04:15:25.670 --> 04:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
dictionary
 
04:15:28.429 --> 04:15:28.439 align:start position:0%
and understood that when you're
 
04:15:32.550 --> 04:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
operating in a quasi judicial capacity
 
04:15:33.870 --> 04:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's because
 
04:15:37.030 --> 04:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
your decision is
 
04:15:39.510 --> 04:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
appealable and when you act in a
 
04:15:39.520 --> 04:15:41.149 align:start position:0%
appealable and when you act in a
judicial

04:15:41.149 --> 04:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
judicial
 
04:15:44.670 --> 04:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
capacity um after hearing uh you you
 
04:15:49.070 --> 04:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
make decisions um after a
 
04:15:49.080 --> 04:15:52.149 align:start position:0%
make decisions um after a
hearing

04:15:52.149 --> 04:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:56.510 --> 04:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:56.520 --> 04:15:59.189 align:start position:0%
 
bill

04:15:59.189 --> 04:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:16:04.030 --> 04:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
also um is duplicative of 91a
 
04:16:07.030 --> 04:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
requirements which is not necessary and
 
04:16:10.750 --> 04:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
it looks like the bill is attempting to
 
04:16:13.750 --> 04:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
mandate a code of conduct for planning
 
04:16:17.550 --> 04:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
boards um which I think is absolutely
 
04:16:17.560 --> 04:16:19.630 align:start position:0%
boards um which I think is absolutely
necessary

04:16:19.630 --> 04:16:19.640 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:16:22.710 --> 04:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
um but go going back to the nature of
 
04:16:24.830 --> 04:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
local planning boards and and judicial
 
04:16:25.950 --> 04:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
and quasi
 
04:16:28.870 --> 04:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
judicial um I did some research and I
 
04:16:34.189 --> 04:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
found that planning boards um are
 
04:16:37.950 --> 04:16:37.960 align:start position:0%
also described as having administrative
 
04:16:40.469 --> 04:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
Powers legislative
 
04:16:43.710 --> 04:16:43.720 align:start position:0%
powers regulatory powers
 
04:16:46.349 --> 04:16:46.359 align:start position:0%
and nonregulatory
 
04:16:49.389 --> 04:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
Powers those last two terms came from
 
04:16:51.030 --> 04:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
the planning board
 
04:16:53.910 --> 04:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
handbook that is put out by the uh
 
04:16:57.510 --> 04:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Business and economic
 
04:17:00.309 --> 04:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
Affairs um they don't use the word
 
04:17:03.229 --> 04:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
judicial in their handbook or quazite
 
04:17:07.030 --> 04:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
judicial so that that's a problem um
 
04:17:08.870 --> 04:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
first of
 
04:17:11.750 --> 04:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
all second of all under this code of
 
04:17:14.309 --> 04:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
conduct which I think is
 
04:17:16.910 --> 04:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
necessary because I've been
 
04:17:20.109 --> 04:17:20.119 align:start position:0%
involved as a citizen activist in my
 
04:17:25.030 --> 04:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
town um being a at the time a licensed
 
04:17:27.149 --> 04:17:27.159 align:start position:0%
private investigator and detective
 
04:17:30.670 --> 04:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
agency owner this was right up my
 
04:17:34.790 --> 04:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
alley um I was kind of appalled to find
 
04:17:37.389 --> 04:17:37.399 align:start position:0%
out that our planning
 
04:17:40.469 --> 04:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
board um doesn't publish their rules of
 
04:17:43.630 --> 04:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
procedure online the average
 
04:17:46.830 --> 04:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
applicant wouldn't even know they
 
04:17:50.309 --> 04:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
exist um they don't follow their
 
04:17:53.309 --> 04:17:53.319 align:start position:0%
rules they ignore them
 
04:17:56.750 --> 04:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
completely and that
 
04:18:01.790 --> 04:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
um thinking this is absolutely necessary
 
04:18:01.800 --> 04:18:04.189 align:start position:0%
um thinking this is absolutely necessary
unfortunately

04:18:04.189 --> 04:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
04:18:08.269 --> 04:18:08.279 align:start position:0%
um they also have a separate
 
04:18:08.279 --> 04:18:11.590 align:start position:0%
um they also have a separate
section

04:18:11.590 --> 04:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:16.109 --> 04:18:16.119 align:start position:0%
for um on page the last page page
 
04:18:20.309 --> 04:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
four um starting on page three Roman
 
04:18:22.550 --> 04:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
five that a planning board shall adopt
 
04:18:24.710 --> 04:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
and operate under a set of rules of
 
04:18:28.910 --> 04:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
procedure according to 676 colon 1 and
 
04:18:32.870 --> 04:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
goes into various
 
04:18:36.790 --> 04:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
um situations where planning board
 
04:18:36.800 --> 04:18:38.349 align:start position:0%
um situations where planning board
members

04:18:38.349 --> 04:18:38.359 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:18:42.910 --> 04:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
can uh applicant can request recusal uh
 
04:18:46.189 --> 04:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
a butter to any project can request
 
04:18:49.030 --> 04:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
recusal or disqualification and we
 
04:18:51.309 --> 04:18:51.319 align:start position:0%
already have
 
04:18:51.319 --> 04:18:53.950 align:start position:0%
already have
disqualification

04:18:53.950 --> 04:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
disqualification
 
04:18:58.229 --> 04:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
um under 673 colon 14 disqualification
 
04:18:59.309 --> 04:18:59.319 align:start position:0%
of a
 
04:18:59.319 --> 04:19:01.349 align:start position:0%
of a
member

04:19:01.349 --> 04:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
member
 
04:19:04.469 --> 04:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
and they actually use the term judicial
 
04:19:07.990 --> 04:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
in that section so a planning board uh
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
member is deciding in a judicial
 
04:19:14.990 --> 04:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
capacity for various reasons they can be
 
04:19:15.000 --> 04:19:17.870 align:start position:0%
capacity for various reasons they can be
disqualified

04:19:17.870 --> 04:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
disqualified
 
04:19:21.109 --> 04:19:21.119 align:start position:0%
um the ab butter
 
04:19:24.269 --> 04:19:24.279 align:start position:0%
Clause under Roman
 
04:19:27.710 --> 04:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
8 the abutter May request a recusal or
 
04:19:29.950 --> 04:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
disqualification of a specific board
 
04:19:31.790 --> 04:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
member but it
 
04:19:36.030 --> 04:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't say for cause it doesn't say any
 
04:19:39.189 --> 04:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
reason why they can an applicant can do
 
04:19:42.149 --> 04:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
the same oh they can only request a
 
04:19:42.159 --> 04:19:43.429 align:start position:0%
the same oh they can only request a
recuse

04:19:43.429 --> 04:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
recuse
 
04:19:47.710 --> 04:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
for cause uh I I hate for cause it's so
 
04:19:50.349 --> 04:19:50.359 align:start position:0%
vague um
 
04:19:50.359 --> 04:19:51.870 align:start position:0%
vague um
under

04:19:51.870 --> 04:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:19:56.109 --> 04:19:56.119 align:start position:0%
673 colon 4 removal of a member they
 
04:19:56.119 --> 04:19:57.950 align:start position:0%
673 colon 4 removal of a member they
cite

04:19:57.950 --> 04:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
cite
 
04:20:01.510 --> 04:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
Malin neglective Duty and inefficiency
 
04:20:05.109 --> 04:20:05.119 align:start position:0%
as a cause for the selectman to remove
 
04:20:05.119 --> 04:20:06.070 align:start position:0%
as a cause for the selectman to remove
an

04:20:06.070 --> 04:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:20:11.070 --> 04:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:15.630 --> 04:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:17.229 --> 04:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
in in my
 
04:20:21.309 --> 04:20:21.319 align:start position:0%
town um we have a ethics
 
04:20:24.109 --> 04:20:24.119 align:start position:0%
problem uh I was before the board
 
04:20:26.389 --> 04:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
regarding an excavation
 
04:20:28.870 --> 04:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
complaint when one of the board members
 
04:20:33.309 --> 04:20:33.319 align:start position:0%
looked at me and into my camera and said
 
04:20:37.189 --> 04:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
she can question our decisions but not
 
04:20:37.199 --> 04:20:39.950 align:start position:0%
she can question our decisions but not
our

04:20:39.950 --> 04:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:43.510 --> 04:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
ethics so I have collected information
 
04:20:46.309 --> 04:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
on wrongdoing um by members of the
 
04:20:48.710 --> 04:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
planning board and the zba that came to
 
04:20:52.109 --> 04:20:52.119 align:start position:0%
light publicly and were
 
04:20:56.830 --> 04:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
rectified um I feel that there has to be
 
04:20:59.429 --> 04:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
a way to
 
04:21:02.269 --> 04:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
prevent people's rights from being
 
04:21:07.070 --> 04:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
trampled on in in these towns that have
 
04:21:10.510 --> 04:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
board members who run
 
04:21:14.149 --> 04:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
unopposed they get on the board
 
04:21:15.790 --> 04:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
04:21:18.109 --> 04:21:18.119 align:start position:0%
self-educate they aren't giving any
 
04:21:20.750 --> 04:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
training materials they're not directed
 
04:21:25.750 --> 04:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
to the chapter uh that regulates their
 
04:21:29.750 --> 04:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
conduct and so as I was going through
 
04:21:33.550 --> 04:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
the be website I
 
04:21:38.269 --> 04:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
encountered the test that you can take
 
04:21:40.950 --> 04:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh based on the planning board
 
04:21:44.670 --> 04:21:44.680 align:start position:0%
handbook um one is a certificate you get
 
04:21:47.149 --> 04:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
a certificate uh at the end of the test
 
04:21:49.670 --> 04:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
if you pass and the other any you just
 
04:21:50.830 --> 04:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
take it for
 
04:21:54.469 --> 04:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
fun um I couldn't pass the one for
 
04:21:58.590 --> 04:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
fun even though I thought that I I
 
04:22:03.030 --> 04:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
could um so I wondered and did speak
 
04:22:06.590 --> 04:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
with Stephanie at um B Anda she was
 
04:22:08.910 --> 04:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
formerly with OSI the office of
 
04:22:11.429 --> 04:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
strategic initiatives I talked with her
 
04:22:13.389 --> 04:22:13.399 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
04:22:16.790 --> 04:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
and I brought her attention to this
 
04:22:21.389 --> 04:22:21.399 align:start position:0%
bill and suggested that
 
04:22:23.790 --> 04:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
maybe what
 
04:22:27.590 --> 04:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
if once you are seated on the
 
04:22:30.710 --> 04:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
board uh you were required to take the
 
04:22:30.720 --> 04:22:32.990 align:start position:0%
board uh you were required to take the
certificate

04:22:32.990 --> 04:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
04:22:36.550 --> 04:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
test and each year that you're you're on
 
04:22:40.229 --> 04:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
the board and you would try to achieve a
 
04:22:42.790 --> 04:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
certificate and whether or not you
 
04:22:45.070 --> 04:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
achieve the certificate would be
 
04:22:47.040 --> 04:22:47.050 align:start position:0%
indicated by your
 
04:22:47.050 --> 04:22:48.229 align:start position:0%
indicated by your
[Music]

04:22:48.229 --> 04:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:22:52.030 --> 04:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
name in the annual
 
04:22:58.550 --> 04:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
report and this would give um uh
 
04:23:01.070 --> 04:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
constituents members of the
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
community um knowledge of the Acumen of
 
04:23:09.309 --> 04:23:09.319 align:start position:0%
the people who are serving in these
 
04:23:09.319 --> 04:23:10.830 align:start position:0%
the people who are serving in these
positions

04:23:10.830 --> 04:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
positions
 
04:23:14.269 --> 04:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
so I support the
 
04:23:17.750 --> 04:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
itl and I'm rather passionate about this
 
04:23:21.229 --> 04:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
subject in fact I think that whatever is
 
04:23:23.149 --> 04:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
implemented for the planning board
 
04:23:25.950 --> 04:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
should be identical for the
 
04:23:31.550 --> 04:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
zba and I think that the whole
 
04:23:35.830 --> 04:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
um chapter needs to be looked at and
 
04:23:39.070 --> 04:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
those sections fixed that would come in
 
04:23:41.870 --> 04:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
line with what uh representative oery is
 
04:23:45.030 --> 04:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve thank
 
04:23:48.149 --> 04:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
you for the comments representative
 
04:23:51.149 --> 04:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman I will be
 
04:23:55.950 --> 04:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
also supporting the itl of hb1 1284 I
 
04:23:59.109 --> 04:23:59.119 align:start position:0%
don't think the uh the bill is necessary
 
04:24:01.309 --> 04:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
we are already doing this in the
 
04:24:03.990 --> 04:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
majority of our communities and I can
 
04:24:06.630 --> 04:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
sympathize with my fellow representative
 
04:24:09.149 --> 04:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
in her community but I think that's an
 
04:24:13.710 --> 04:24:13.720 align:start position:0%
exception as opposed to um
 
04:24:15.950 --> 04:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
what is what is currently going on in
 
04:24:19.149 --> 04:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so again I will support
 
04:24:21.870 --> 04:24:21.880 align:start position:0%

zero okay that closes the exact session
 
04:27:02.710 --> 04:27:02.720 align:start position:0%

1280 when the clerk gives me the nod we
 
04:27:09.030 --> 04:27:09.040 align:start position:0%

04:27:14.950 --> 04:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:18.309 --> 04:27:18.319 align:start position:0%
1345 relative to the length of terms for
 
04:27:21.030 --> 04:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
Coos County
 
04:27:28.109 --> 04:27:28.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:32.030 --> 04:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
yella um it sounds like an itl to me but
 
04:27:36.309 --> 04:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh I make a motion at itl thank
 
04:27:39.070 --> 04:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
you do we have a second I second that Mr
 
04:27:40.870 --> 04:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
chairman representative Brown seconds
 
04:27:42.750 --> 04:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
the motion would you like to speak to
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
your motion represent
 
04:27:50.910 --> 04:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
Kella um yes I believe that
 
04:27:50.920 --> 04:27:53.710 align:start position:0%
Kella um yes I believe that
um

04:27:53.710 --> 04:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:58.990 --> 04:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
that that this bill is um kind of
 
04:28:03.670 --> 04:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
perpetuating a problem I think that when
 
04:28:08.990 --> 04:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
we first heard about Rockingham trying
 
04:28:11.229 --> 04:28:11.239 align:start position:0%
to and I am a member of Rockingham
 
04:28:16.070 --> 04:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
Rockingham trying to switch from um two
 
04:28:18.429 --> 04:28:18.439 align:start position:0%
legislative uh a two-year legislative
 
04:28:20.710 --> 04:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
cycle to a four-year legislative cycle I
 
04:28:24.149 --> 04:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
think that it was um some
 
04:28:27.070 --> 04:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
Representatives trying to do their
 
04:28:30.910 --> 04:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
friends a favor and trying to make them
 
04:28:34.229 --> 04:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
not have to run as often I don't think
 
04:28:37.070 --> 04:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
that it was the
 
04:28:40.870 --> 04:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
constituents that said oh we don't want
 
04:28:45.309 --> 04:28:45.319 align:start position:0%
to have this control over this the
 
04:28:47.189 --> 04:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
county officers like we have control
 
04:28:49.830 --> 04:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
over the state reps and as we have over
 
04:28:49.840 --> 04:28:51.030 align:start position:0%
over the state reps and as we have over
the

04:28:51.030 --> 04:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:56.030 --> 04:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
governorship it is just people trying to
 
04:28:59.149 --> 04:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
help out them their friends um I think
 
04:29:02.790 --> 04:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
that the argument about um you know that
 
04:29:05.790 --> 04:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
there is it's a complex job and people
 
04:29:07.590 --> 04:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
have to learn it I think that is no
 
04:29:11.870 --> 04:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
different than being uh the governor or
 
04:29:11.880 --> 04:29:13.309 align:start position:0%
different than being uh the governor or
uh

04:29:13.309 --> 04:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:29:16.269 --> 04:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
even a State Rep um I think that we
 
04:29:20.349 --> 04:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
learn as we go and we have expertise as
 
04:29:25.670 --> 04:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
we serve longer um just like they do um
 
04:29:28.910 --> 04:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
04:29:31.070 --> 04:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
that there
 
04:29:31.080 --> 04:29:32.670 align:start position:0%
that there
is

04:29:32.670 --> 04:29:32.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:29:35.750 --> 04:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
um like taking away the opportunity for
 
04:29:38.269 --> 04:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
a Mis for the voters to be able to
 
04:29:42.830 --> 04:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
change course if they chose um someone
 
04:29:45.710 --> 04:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
that kind of was taking their County in
 
04:29:47.950 --> 04:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
the wrong direction whether that be the
 
04:29:51.990 --> 04:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
the the sheriff or the register of deeds
 
04:29:56.830 --> 04:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
or the uh the County Attorney the County
 
04:30:01.429 --> 04:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
Attorney wasn't Prosecuting cases or or
 
04:30:05.309 --> 04:30:05.319 align:start position:0%
um was was uh you
 
04:30:08.630 --> 04:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
know having favoritism towards someone
 
04:30:11.389 --> 04:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
or or something I think that the voters
 
04:30:13.229 --> 04:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
should be able to take action against
 
04:30:16.469 --> 04:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
that I think that you know just as if
 
04:30:17.950 --> 04:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
the governor is doing something
 
04:30:21.349 --> 04:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
inappropriate you should be able to um
 
04:30:23.670 --> 04:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
vote for the governor to be replaced in
 
04:30:27.389 --> 04:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
two years I don't think that I I would
 
04:30:30.269 --> 04:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
not be in favor of of changing our terms
 
04:30:33.189 --> 04:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
to four years as a state reps I am not
 
04:30:34.910 --> 04:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
in favor of changing Senators even
 
04:30:38.590 --> 04:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
though senators are are um you know
 
04:30:43.189 --> 04:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
have a much more uh full place I'm not I
 
04:30:45.630 --> 04:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be in favor of changing the
 
04:30:48.309 --> 04:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
governorship uh to to four years so I
 
04:30:50.349 --> 04:30:50.359 align:start position:0%
think that 2 years is the correct amount
 
04:30:54.630 --> 04:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
of time and that we made an error
 
04:30:58.990 --> 04:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
in uh extending the length of of time
 
04:31:00.790 --> 04:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
for County officers for Rockingham
 
04:31:03.149 --> 04:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
County and so for that reason I don't
 
04:31:05.550 --> 04:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
want to perpetuate um expanding that
 
04:31:09.590 --> 04:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
error instead um I would prefer to see a
 
04:31:12.389 --> 04:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
build reversing that kind of like we we
 
04:31:14.910 --> 04:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
we saw earlier today with uh reversing
 
04:31:18.510 --> 04:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
the changes on2 I think that um there
 
04:31:20.030 --> 04:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
was an error made and I think we need
 
04:31:22.269 --> 04:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
need to remedy that thank
 
04:31:25.510 --> 04:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
you further comments uh representative
 
04:31:27.790 --> 04:31:27.800 align:start position:0%

fourth term here and every term there
 
04:31:35.550 --> 04:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
has been one bill from some or other
 
04:31:40.389 --> 04:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
County to change one or other thing
 
04:31:44.950 --> 04:31:44.960 align:start position:0%

04:31:53.349 --> 04:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding um this one with the
 
04:31:55.469 --> 04:31:55.479 align:start position:0%
terms of officers we did it in
 
04:31:57.910 --> 04:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
Rockingham and you look at the chapters
 
04:32:00.389 --> 04:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
of the of about the counties and then
 
04:32:04.030 --> 04:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
there are these carots for a particular
 
04:32:06.670 --> 04:32:06.680 align:start position:0%
County because of its situation
 
04:32:08.990 --> 04:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
geographically or it situation
 
04:32:10.910 --> 04:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
demographically or as far you know
 
04:32:12.670 --> 04:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
population wise
 
04:32:16.389 --> 04:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
um and I really want to get working with
 
04:32:19.910 --> 04:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire um uh County
 
04:32:22.630 --> 04:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
Association to figure out that chapter
 
04:32:25.429 --> 04:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
which is relatively short but each each
 
04:32:27.950 --> 04:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh section of it has a lot of pieces and
 
04:32:30.109 --> 04:32:30.119 align:start position:0%
that's because every county is different
 
04:32:33.429 --> 04:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
when we did this uh uh change for
 
04:32:35.870 --> 04:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County I will say that it was
 
04:32:38.469 --> 04:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
well let's see how it goes and that was
 
04:32:42.349 --> 04:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
last year or the year before um so maybe
 
04:32:44.790 --> 04:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen how it goes but I agreed
 
04:32:47.389 --> 04:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
with them in that uh the positions that
 
04:32:50.389 --> 04:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
we're talking about are kind of career
 
04:32:54.830 --> 04:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
positions um that need this need a a
 
04:32:59.510 --> 04:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
cons consistent um leadership much like
 
04:33:01.990 --> 04:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh when the governor comes in he can
 
04:33:03.830 --> 04:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
replace all of the department
 
04:33:06.070 --> 04:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners if he wants to so when a
 
04:33:08.629 --> 04:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
new new governor comes in they can
 
04:33:11.029 --> 04:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
replace everybody that's leading any of
 
04:33:12.869 --> 04:33:12.879 align:start position:0%
the Departments and that would be the
 
04:33:15.789 --> 04:33:15.799 align:start position:0%
same thing here if we keep on doing the
 
04:33:18.990 --> 04:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
every twoyear cycle of Elections and and
 
04:33:21.990 --> 04:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
these folks are bossed by the
 
04:33:24.150 --> 04:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
Departments ahead of them not by the
 
04:33:27.070 --> 04:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
voters actually
 
04:33:30.390 --> 04:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
um although you know we can wait and un
 
04:33:32.470 --> 04:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
disel them by voting in for somebody
 
04:33:34.750 --> 04:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
else but I I just want to say that it
 
04:33:37.949 --> 04:33:37.959 align:start position:0%
makes more sense for this level of of U
 
04:33:40.189 --> 04:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
Administration to have a longer term in
 
04:33:42.269 --> 04:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
order to not have to change over
 
04:33:44.949 --> 04:33:44.959 align:start position:0%
employees to have a consistent work uh
 
04:33:48.429 --> 04:33:48.439 align:start position:0%
working environment uh than working for
 
04:33:50.070 --> 04:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
a year and then running for election per
 
04:33:52.470 --> 04:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
year and having people in their
 
04:33:54.789 --> 04:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
departments do
 
04:33:59.109 --> 04:33:59.119 align:start position:0%
um dis not discom but not not
 
04:34:03.150 --> 04:34:03.160 align:start position:0%
continuously the same kind of work or
 
04:34:08.269 --> 04:34:08.279 align:start position:0%
Works um outcome s of but thank you Mr
 
04:34:10.709 --> 04:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
chair representative
 
04:34:10.719 --> 04:34:12.230 align:start position:0%
chair representative
Lala

04:34:12.230 --> 04:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
Lala
 
04:34:15.830 --> 04:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I would uh voice
 
04:34:19.551 --> 04:34:19.561 align:start position:0%
my agreement with my colleague about uh
 
04:34:20.590 --> 04:34:20.600 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
04:34:25.551 --> 04:34:25.561 align:start position:0%
continuity when you have in our case um
 
04:34:27.390 --> 04:34:27.400 align:start position:0%
and in situations where we have a
 
04:34:30.869 --> 04:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
two-year term there there are no staff
 
04:34:33.349 --> 04:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
members that we have to bring along with
 
04:34:36.269 --> 04:34:36.279 align:start position:0%
us I think during the hearing uh when
 
04:34:39.510 --> 04:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
the Coos County uh people were here they
 
04:34:42.670 --> 04:34:42.680 align:start position:0%
made a really good argument to the fact
 
04:34:47.510 --> 04:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
that you need that continuity of of uh
 
04:34:52.429 --> 04:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
um of service uh not so much with the
 
04:34:56.029 --> 04:34:56.039 align:start position:0%
with the uh the people that are elected
 
04:34:58.510 --> 04:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
but with the staff that comes along with
 
04:35:02.070 --> 04:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
that and the the systems that are put in
 
04:35:06.470 --> 04:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
place uh and and so to me that four
 
04:35:11.429 --> 04:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
years uh makes perfect sense um and the
 
04:35:14.949 --> 04:35:14.959 align:start position:0%
the the other thing about uh Coos County
 
04:35:18.230 --> 04:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
and and the point was made that there
 
04:35:22.750 --> 04:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
are some unique aspects of Coos County
 
04:35:27.269 --> 04:35:27.279 align:start position:0%
being so Rural and having so many towns
 
04:35:30.590 --> 04:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
that don't have local police departments
 
04:35:32.750 --> 04:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we have a foreign
 
04:35:36.709 --> 04:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
border that borders Coos County and uh
 
04:35:39.990 --> 04:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have so many
 
04:35:42.429 --> 04:35:42.439 align:start position:0%
unincorporated communi
 
04:35:46.629 --> 04:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
up there so to me all of those factors
 
04:35:51.830 --> 04:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
weigh in to making uh uh that this bill
 
04:35:55.349 --> 04:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me so I will be voting
 
04:35:57.629 --> 04:35:57.639 align:start position:0%
against the
 
04:35:59.629 --> 04:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
itl representative
 
04:36:04.310 --> 04:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
PRI thank you Mr uh Mr chairman um I
 
04:36:08.990 --> 04:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
will also be voting no on the um
 
04:36:11.830 --> 04:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
itl uh for the reasons that have been
 
04:36:15.029 --> 04:36:15.039 align:start position:0%
stated by representative Gilman and L
 
04:36:18.590 --> 04:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
Alis um there is a learning curve to
 
04:36:21.390 --> 04:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
these three professional positions or
 
04:36:24.390 --> 04:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
four I should say and they you know
 
04:36:25.949 --> 04:36:25.959 align:start position:0%
whenever you're on a learning curve it
 
04:36:29.029 --> 04:36:29.039 align:start position:0%
it costs the taxpayers money for them to
 
04:36:34.269 --> 04:36:34.279 align:start position:0%
be trained as to what is going on and
 
04:36:38.269 --> 04:36:38.279 align:start position:0%
one year is probably in some cases not
 
04:36:41.869 --> 04:36:41.879 align:start position:0%
enough and two years they have to spend
 
04:36:45.910 --> 04:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
a campaigning again for the next year
 
04:36:48.670 --> 04:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
and so I really think it makes sense
 
04:36:51.150 --> 04:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
especially for coas County because of
 
04:36:54.750 --> 04:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
its size and its complexities that this
 
04:36:56.869 --> 04:36:56.879 align:start position:0%
makes sense thank
 
04:37:01.070 --> 04:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
you repr kill thank you Mr chair um I
 
04:37:04.750 --> 04:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
too will be voting against the itl um I
 
04:37:07.510 --> 04:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't on this committee a few years ago
 
04:37:10.029 --> 04:37:10.039 align:start position:0%
when Rockingham County was changed to
 
04:37:12.310 --> 04:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
fouryear terms but I'm I'm a member of
 
04:37:13.990 --> 04:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
I'm currently a member of the Rockingham
 
04:37:18.429 --> 04:37:18.439 align:start position:0%
County delegation and um I think I paid
 
04:37:20.709 --> 04:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
attention to those hearings and a lot of
 
04:37:22.910 --> 04:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
the stuff that was said was I think on
 
04:37:25.029 --> 04:37:25.039 align:start position:0%
average um sheriffs have like sixe terms
 
04:37:28.269 --> 04:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
around in other states and I think that
 
04:37:32.470 --> 04:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
that gives the people a a way better
 
04:37:35.949 --> 04:37:35.959 align:start position:0%
product um because of what my colleague
 
04:37:37.789 --> 04:37:37.799 align:start position:0%
just mentioned training I mean they have
 
04:37:39.590 --> 04:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
to go through so much training and learn
 
04:37:42.269 --> 04:37:42.279 align:start position:0%
that job and and I think it's benefited
 
04:37:44.349 --> 04:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County that we we've made the
 
04:37:46.429 --> 04:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
change I mean we're leading the way on
 
04:37:48.670 --> 04:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
all the drug interjections right now
 
04:37:50.310 --> 04:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
like we're doing really good things with
 
04:37:52.269 --> 04:37:52.279 align:start position:0%
our departments our registry of deeds is
 
04:37:54.869 --> 04:37:54.879 align:start position:0%
unbelievable right so she she's been
 
04:37:58.510 --> 04:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
doing huge things with um caling all all
 
04:38:00.269 --> 04:38:00.279 align:start position:0%
our past stuff she's working on a
 
04:38:02.429 --> 04:38:02.439 align:start position:0%
multi-year project if she had
 
04:38:04.910 --> 04:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
to stop in the middle of her project to
 
04:38:07.390 --> 04:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
run and for reelection well and she is
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
saving us money um so I think that
 
04:38:14.070 --> 04:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
we we gave it for Rockingham County I
 
04:38:15.990 --> 04:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
think it would be very hard for us to
 
04:38:18.750 --> 04:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
say no to another County when their
 
04:38:21.029 --> 04:38:21.039 align:start position:0%
entire I think pretty much their entire
 
04:38:23.029 --> 04:38:23.039 align:start position:0%
delegation came here all all their
 
04:38:25.910 --> 04:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and all all asked us to do
 
04:38:28.470 --> 04:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
it I think it would be very very hard
 
04:38:30.869 --> 04:38:30.879 align:start position:0%
for us to say no to them there's that's
 
04:38:33.750 --> 04:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
and so I'll be voting against the
 
04:38:35.990 --> 04:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
itl representative
 
04:38:39.109 --> 04:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman this is my
 
04:38:42.070 --> 04:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
second term on serving on municipal
 
04:38:45.230 --> 04:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
in County government and that is correct
 
04:38:47.709 --> 04:38:47.719 align:start position:0%
we we had a bill in
 
04:38:52.029 --> 04:38:52.039 align:start position:0%
2022 um that's been commented upon that
 
04:38:54.310 --> 04:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
that did change the length of terms for
 
04:38:57.709 --> 04:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
the Rockingham County officers from 2 to
 
04:38:57.719 --> 04:38:59.949 align:start position:0%
the Rockingham County officers from 2 to
four

04:38:59.949 --> 04:38:59.959 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:39:04.230 --> 04:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
and if so when the bill came before this
 
04:39:07.709 --> 04:39:07.719 align:start position:0%
committee the committee actually um
 
04:39:09.230 --> 04:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
adopted an
 
04:39:12.269 --> 04:39:12.279 align:start position:0%
amendment which because in in the
 
04:39:14.189 --> 04:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
committee we we thought that it was in
 
04:39:18.349 --> 04:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
fact a a warranted and a good idea to to
 
04:39:22.390 --> 04:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
um have that change from the two to four
 
04:39:24.070 --> 04:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:39:27.070 --> 04:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
committee supported an amendment to have
 
04:39:31.510 --> 04:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
this apply to all of the counties within
 
04:39:34.349 --> 04:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
the state and that passed out of our
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
committee um 19 to Z went on consent
 
04:39:39.868 --> 04:39:39.878 align:start position:0%
calendar however on the house floor it
 
04:39:41.910 --> 04:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
was removed from the consent calendar
 
04:39:44.670 --> 04:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
and that amendment was was stripped off
 
04:39:47.590 --> 04:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
and it was passed just for Rockingham
 
04:39:51.990 --> 04:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
County so um that all being said I I do
 
04:39:55.390 --> 04:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
see the value in the cont continuity
 
04:39:57.628 --> 04:39:57.638 align:start position:0%
that's afforded by changing this from
 
04:40:00.788 --> 04:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
two to four years that that gives the um
 
04:40:02.868 --> 04:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
the different offices the positions and
 
04:40:04.750 --> 04:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
the different offices the ability to be
 
04:40:07.868 --> 04:40:07.878 align:start position:0%
able to focus on the jobs at hand and
 
04:40:11.030 --> 04:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
not have to Pivot and start a campaign
 
04:40:14.430 --> 04:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
um when you have just twoyear
 
04:40:18.270 --> 04:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
terms and um just to back up with
 
04:40:20.230 --> 04:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
representative from Rockingham County
 
04:40:24.270 --> 04:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
said um yes in fact the nine delegation
 
04:40:27.868 --> 04:40:27.878 align:start position:0%
um members of Co Coos County they did
 
04:40:30.150 --> 04:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
vote to approve the bill as did the
 
04:40:35.708 --> 04:40:35.718 align:start position:0%
three commissioners of Coos County to so
 
04:40:40.510 --> 04:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
um I would support that for that reason
 
04:40:43.550 --> 04:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
and the reasons stated I I do support
 
04:40:45.628 --> 04:40:45.638 align:start position:0%
this underlying bill I'll be voting
 
04:40:48.350 --> 04:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
against the itl motion because with
 
04:40:51.628 --> 04:40:51.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:54.270 --> 04:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
government these issues we can change
 
04:40:57.868 --> 04:40:57.878 align:start position:0%
the statute when we have the the support
 
04:41:00.470 --> 04:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
of the delegation and and the
 
04:41:02.948 --> 04:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and to me this is this is
 
04:41:05.750 --> 04:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
what I see in front of me Coos County
 
04:41:08.628 --> 04:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
wants this so I'm I'm willing to support
 
04:41:10.230 --> 04:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr
 
04:41:12.868 --> 04:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
chairman for the comments representative
 
04:41:16.510 --> 04:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chairman um I tend to
 
04:41:17.990 --> 04:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
agree with my peers that have just
 
04:41:20.788 --> 04:41:20.798 align:start position:0%
spoken about the fact that it should be
 
04:41:23.110 --> 04:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
Statewide and the reason why I agree
 
04:41:25.470 --> 04:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
with it um on our County delegation we
 
04:41:29.110 --> 04:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
just had our uh uh County attorney
 
04:41:31.390 --> 04:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
resigned to take another job here in
 
04:41:36.590 --> 04:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
conquer and uh her Deputy uh was sworn
 
04:41:39.350 --> 04:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
in as her replacement as she recommended
 
04:41:40.788 --> 04:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
and he's immediately going to have to
 
04:41:43.550 --> 04:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
run for for office this fall uh when you
 
04:41:45.910 --> 04:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
look at attorneys especially in places
 
04:41:50.350 --> 04:41:50.360 align:start position:0%
like uh Carol County or Coos County the
 
04:41:52.230 --> 04:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
difficulty to find someone that you
 
04:41:54.670 --> 04:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
might feel is qualified would take a
 
04:41:57.230 --> 04:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
little bit more time especially
 
04:41:59.310 --> 04:41:59.320 align:start position:0%
regarding the learning curve so I think
 
04:42:00.990 --> 04:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate for this type of
 
04:42:03.948 --> 04:42:03.958 align:start position:0%
position to be a a longer term and i
 
04:42:07.270 --> 04:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
would support an amendment to uh make it
 
04:42:10.150 --> 04:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
the same as Rockingham County thank
 
04:42:10.160 --> 04:42:12.430 align:start position:0%
the same as Rockingham County thank
you

04:42:12.430 --> 04:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:42:15.788 --> 04:42:15.798 align:start position:0%
representative kill I did want to add I
 
04:42:18.628 --> 04:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
while I I think this is beneficial I do
 
04:42:21.270 --> 04:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
think that to my colleague if if you
 
04:42:22.550 --> 04:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
think that this should be changed you
 
04:42:24.830 --> 04:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
should put a bill in to to change it
 
04:42:26.948 --> 04:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
back like a separate
 
04:42:28.990 --> 04:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
bill in the
 
04:42:34.230 --> 04:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:37.868 --> 04:42:37.878 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none um I'll make a
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
quick couple um I'm in complete
 
04:42:43.390 --> 04:42:43.400 align:start position:0%
agreement with representative
 
04:42:47.990 --> 04:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
yella um I I believe it was a it was
 
04:42:49.708 --> 04:42:49.718 align:start position:0%
wrong I wasn't here on the committee but
 
04:42:52.788 --> 04:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
I believe it was wrong to go to um to
 
04:42:56.230 --> 04:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
start allowing individual counties to
 
04:42:58.708 --> 04:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
get away from the uniformity of having
 
04:43:01.110 --> 04:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
the counties operate the same way I can
 
04:43:04.390 --> 04:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
give you exact two great reasons why the
 
04:43:06.590 --> 04:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
terms need to be short uh I don't know
 
04:43:07.830 --> 04:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
how many of you are familiar with the
 
04:43:09.550 --> 04:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
sheriff situation we've been dealing
 
04:43:12.270 --> 04:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
with in straford County uh there there's
 
04:43:14.750 --> 04:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
a a reason right there alone we also had
 
04:43:17.670 --> 04:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
a similar situation where uh an elected
 
04:43:21.070 --> 04:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
attorney was promoted somewhere else um
 
04:43:24.070 --> 04:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
so now um in my County as we talked
 
04:43:26.910 --> 04:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
about on a previous Bill the county is a
 
04:43:30.390 --> 04:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
majority of one party versus the other
 
04:43:32.230 --> 04:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
there's no election it's just basically
 
04:43:34.788 --> 04:43:34.798 align:start position:0%
appointed by the county delegation um so
 
04:43:37.510 --> 04:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
in that case I would like I would rather
 
04:43:39.670 --> 04:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
instead of waiting four years to see
 
04:43:41.948 --> 04:43:41.958 align:start position:0%
that attorney be elected did through the
 
04:43:47.110 --> 04:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
the normal election process as far as uh
 
04:43:50.550 --> 04:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
Coos we heard a lot of comments
 
04:43:53.510 --> 04:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
and couple of the things kind of stuck
 
04:43:57.070 --> 04:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
out one of them was yes the comment was
 
04:43:59.550 --> 04:43:59.560 align:start position:0%
made yes some people uh Run for the
 
04:44:02.030 --> 04:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
office to figure out if they like the
 
04:44:05.470 --> 04:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
job well I'm not so sure that's a reason
 
04:44:07.310 --> 04:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
to be running for some of these jobs
 
04:44:09.990 --> 04:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
that that kind of says to me that
 
04:44:11.670 --> 04:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
they're they're trying to
 
04:44:13.270 --> 04:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
that it may they may not even be there
 
04:44:16.670 --> 04:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
for a full term to be to begin with I
 
04:44:18.868 --> 04:44:18.878 align:start position:0%
spoke about uh our Sheriff's issue and
 
04:44:21.190 --> 04:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
the removal process and what we've gone
 
04:44:21.200 --> 04:44:22.110 align:start position:0%
the removal process and what we've gone
through

04:44:22.110 --> 04:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:44:26.190 --> 04:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
there um the other thing was uh one of
 
04:44:28.670 --> 04:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
the individuals captain of a sheriff I
 
04:44:30.910 --> 04:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
believe made the comment well this we
 
04:44:32.910 --> 04:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
don't really have big turnover in Coos
 
04:44:35.430 --> 04:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
anyway so I'm I'm not
 
04:44:38.350 --> 04:44:38.360 align:start position:0%
sure um how
 
04:44:43.030 --> 04:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
much uh time they actually have to spend
 
04:44:45.670 --> 04:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
campaigning so
 
04:44:49.230 --> 04:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
I I I again I'm I'm
 
04:44:51.470 --> 04:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
for almost
 
04:44:54.350 --> 04:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
recapturing Rockingham County back to a
 
04:44:58.110 --> 04:44:58.120 align:start position:0%
two-year term rather than expanding it
 
04:45:00.150 --> 04:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
county by county getting away from the
 
04:45:02.350 --> 04:45:02.360 align:start position:0%
uniformity so I I will vote in favor of
 
04:45:04.990 --> 04:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
the itail further
 
04:45:07.628 --> 04:45:07.638 align:start position:0%

04:50:32.990 --> 04:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
I have a motion representative priest
 
04:50:35.628 --> 04:50:35.638 align:start position:0%

04:50:41.440 --> 04:50:43.590 align:start position:0%
to ought to pass
HB

04:50:43.590 --> 04:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
HB
 
04:50:45.990 --> 04:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
1371 do we have a
 
04:50:49.190 --> 04:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
second second representative majori
 
04:50:51.430 --> 04:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
seconds representative priest would you
 
04:50:53.310 --> 04:50:53.320 align:start position:0%
like to
 
04:50:56.070 --> 04:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
speak yes I would thank you very much Mr
 
04:50:58.788 --> 04:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
chairman I think this is a very
 
04:51:02.670 --> 04:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
important uh element for community's
 
04:51:06.350 --> 04:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
master plan and I think it should be in
 
04:51:10.548 --> 04:51:10.558 align:start position:0%
the sections where it the that the Comm
 
04:51:12.868 --> 04:51:12.878 align:start position:0%
communities may consider it so it's not
 
04:51:16.868 --> 04:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
a mandate it's just one of the sections
 
04:51:21.470 --> 04:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
on section three that they need to
 
04:51:24.788 --> 04:51:24.798 align:start position:0%
address if they want to like
 
04:51:27.110 --> 04:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
Transportation or Economic Development
 
04:51:29.430 --> 04:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
or natural resources but I think it
 
04:51:32.830 --> 04:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
rises to that element of
 
04:51:35.628 --> 04:51:35.638 align:start position:0%
importance especially
 
04:51:40.590 --> 04:51:40.600 align:start position:0%
um in this age where uh landfills are
 
04:51:43.990 --> 04:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
coming less and less and we need to
 
04:51:47.310 --> 04:51:47.320 align:start position:0%
focus on how we can reduce the amount of
 
04:51:51.670 --> 04:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
waste in our communities thank
 
04:51:54.270 --> 04:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
you further comments representative
 
04:51:57.230 --> 04:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
Brown yes Mr chairman could you clarify
 
04:51:58.430 --> 04:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
something for me is there anything in
 
04:52:01.430 --> 04:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
the current law that uh prohibits them
 
04:52:05.430 --> 04:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
from doing that anyways without this
 
04:52:08.150 --> 04:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
change interesting you should ask that
 
04:52:13.230 --> 04:52:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:16.510 --> 04:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
it's one of those issues that I've long
 
04:52:19.788 --> 04:52:19.798 align:start position:0%
thought that when you get into this
 
04:52:22.390 --> 04:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
P particular
 
04:52:26.750 --> 04:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
RSA it's a NeverEnding list of what
 
04:52:29.030 --> 04:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
towns may
 
04:52:31.350 --> 04:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
do there's nothing that prevents them
 
04:52:33.670 --> 04:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
from already doing this they can already
 
04:52:37.030 --> 04:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
it's just it's it's a master plan here's
 
04:52:39.430 --> 04:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
what you may consider in your master
 
04:52:39.440 --> 04:52:41.030 align:start position:0%
what you may consider in your master
plan

04:52:41.030 --> 04:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
plan
 
04:52:43.990 --> 04:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
um I've always thought it might be
 
04:52:46.788 --> 04:52:46.798 align:start position:0%
easier just to up on the top and then
 
04:52:48.310 --> 04:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
don't quote me on this I'm kind of doing
 
04:52:51.070 --> 04:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
a paraphrase here but and the town may
 
04:52:54.628 --> 04:52:54.638 align:start position:0%
consider any other items they wish in
 
04:52:58.230 --> 04:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
their plant this is just adding one more
 
04:53:01.190 --> 04:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
I don't see it honestly as I'm I'm kind
 
04:53:02.708 --> 04:53:02.718 align:start position:0%
of in the middle I really don't care
 
04:53:04.470 --> 04:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
about it I I don't think it's that
 
04:53:04.480 --> 04:53:05.708 align:start position:0%
about it I I don't think it's that
meaningful

04:53:05.708 --> 04:53:05.718 align:start position:0%
meaningful
 
04:53:09.110 --> 04:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
but hope that answers your question
 
04:53:13.708 --> 04:53:13.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:16.708 --> 04:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman I I I can
 
04:53:18.910 --> 04:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
defer to representative
 
04:53:21.990 --> 04:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
majority seeing that representative
 
04:53:26.150 --> 04:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
Brown just spoke no okay so um my
 
04:53:30.670 --> 04:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this bill would um
 
04:53:35.948 --> 04:53:35.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:38.990 --> 04:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
statute relative to the master plan and
 
04:53:40.910 --> 04:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
like you said there's there's section a
 
04:53:42.430 --> 04:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
through o and this just would add
 
04:53:44.270 --> 04:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
another one and to be clear that these
 
04:53:45.990 --> 04:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
are optional
 
04:53:51.270 --> 04:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
portions so the addition of of this um
 
04:53:54.310 --> 04:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
particular section on waste reduction to
 
04:53:58.230 --> 04:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
me causes no harm additionally I'd like
 
04:54:02.628 --> 04:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
to add that having spoke to um a member
 
04:54:06.110 --> 04:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
of my local planning board it was
 
04:54:10.070 --> 04:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
commented to me that by adding this to
 
04:54:12.110 --> 04:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
this section of Statute that this would
 
04:54:16.628 --> 04:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
therefore enable the municipality to um
 
04:54:20.670 --> 04:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
consider and propose uh ordinances um
 
04:54:23.430 --> 04:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
surrounding this this this issue which I
 
04:54:26.990 --> 04:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
think is an important tool so I will be
 
04:54:29.830 --> 04:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
supporting an
 
04:54:31.830 --> 04:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
OTP representative
 
04:54:35.150 --> 04:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
major thank you Mr chairman I I will be
 
04:54:39.110 --> 04:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
um supporting the OTP on this um just
 
04:54:41.548 --> 04:54:41.558 align:start position:0%
say that I know I'm supposed to take out
 
04:54:43.190 --> 04:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
the garbage but I don't unless my wife
 
04:54:45.030 --> 04:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
reminds me and she has to remind me all
 
04:54:48.470 --> 04:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
the time so I I think it would be I
 
04:54:51.030 --> 04:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
while I agree any the towns can do this
 
04:54:52.948 --> 04:54:52.958 align:start position:0%
we already can do this I think it's very
 
04:54:54.628 --> 04:54:54.638 align:start position:0%
important to have it in front of them as
 
04:54:57.070 --> 04:54:57.080 align:start position:0%
somebody many of us in this room are on
 
04:54:58.750 --> 04:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
planning boards and we've sat there and
 
04:55:00.868 --> 04:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
we know what our role is when we review
 
04:55:03.590 --> 04:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
and and revise our master plan having it
 
04:55:06.230 --> 04:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
in front of me just the words I I'm
 
04:55:08.548 --> 04:55:08.558 align:start position:0%
reminded let's consider this I I think
 
04:55:11.430 --> 04:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
as as was just said uh I think it does
 
04:55:14.510 --> 04:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
no harm and therefore it is good thank
 
04:55:17.948 --> 04:55:17.958 align:start position:0%
you for the comments representative
 
04:55:20.948 --> 04:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair um I also am
 
04:55:23.270 --> 04:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
going to in I'm in favor of this bill
 
04:55:26.708 --> 04:55:26.718 align:start position:0%
and um as representative majori said uh
 
04:55:29.150 --> 04:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes people just need a little kick
 
04:55:31.628 --> 04:55:31.638 align:start position:0%
to start thinking about things and my
 
04:55:33.548 --> 04:55:33.558 align:start position:0%
town recently went through its five-year
 
04:55:36.990 --> 04:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
upgrade of the master plan and when and
 
04:55:38.868 --> 04:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
we presented the list of what's
 
04:55:40.830 --> 04:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
recommended by the state
 
04:55:43.590 --> 04:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
um it it got people thinking about well
 
04:55:45.548 --> 04:55:45.558 align:start position:0%
what's more important is it the energy
 
04:55:48.270 --> 04:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
section or is it Regional concerns or is
 
04:55:51.708 --> 04:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
it public service um and we had just
 
04:55:54.190 --> 04:55:54.200 align:start position:0%
added the energy section last year I
 
04:55:56.830 --> 04:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
believe or no
 
04:55:56.840 --> 04:55:58.708 align:start position:0%
believe or no
2013

04:55:58.708 --> 04:55:58.718 align:start position:0%
2013
 
04:56:03.070 --> 04:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
um so adding this also uh
 
04:56:05.628 --> 04:56:05.638 align:start position:0%
um on Waste Management we have another
 
04:56:09.430 --> 04:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
bill about uh waste management districts
 
04:56:12.350 --> 04:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
and my t has actually gone into quite a
 
04:56:15.868 --> 04:56:15.878 align:start position:0%
healthy um series of of waste management
 
04:56:18.350 --> 04:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
or waste reduction uh but there isn't
 
04:56:20.548 --> 04:56:20.558 align:start position:0%
any goal set for how much we want to do
 
04:56:22.788 --> 04:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
it's just here's the tools to use it and
 
04:56:24.590 --> 04:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
if you put it in the master plan you
 
04:56:27.270 --> 04:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
need you also need to set a short and
 
04:56:30.990 --> 04:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
long and Midterm goal to get to the
 
04:56:33.750 --> 04:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
point of you know we want only 5% waste
 
04:56:37.230 --> 04:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
reduction this year Etc so again it's
 
04:56:39.628 --> 04:56:39.638 align:start position:0%
just um adding it to the list yeah it
 
04:56:41.910 --> 04:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
seems kind of foolish to have this list
 
04:56:44.830 --> 04:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
and let people you know let Town towns
 
04:56:46.868 --> 04:56:46.878 align:start position:0%
figure out what they want but having
 
04:56:48.788 --> 04:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
that little nudge that says consider
 
04:56:50.990 --> 04:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
these things please I think is a good
 
04:56:52.990 --> 04:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
idea thank
 
04:56:55.510 --> 04:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
you further
 
04:56:57.948 --> 04:56:57.958 align:start position:0%
comments uh representative
 
04:57:01.788 --> 04:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
Guth thank you Mr chairman I agree that
 
04:57:04.868 --> 04:57:04.878 align:start position:0%
uh this is uh something that individual
 
04:57:07.990 --> 04:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
towns could do that do anyway however I
 
04:57:10.990 --> 04:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
think it's as many of the previous
 
04:57:13.070 --> 04:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
speakers have said it's a good thing to
 
04:57:15.510 --> 04:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
have it in front of you not only that I
 
04:57:18.470 --> 04:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
think the solid waste is probably
 
04:57:20.230 --> 04:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
depending on how you're getting rid of
 
04:57:23.430 --> 04:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
your waste is a significant part of the
 
04:57:26.750 --> 04:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
budgets uh in in the communities and
 
04:57:30.548 --> 04:57:30.558 align:start position:0%
also it ends up in the CIP Capital
 
04:57:33.910 --> 04:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan if it's in your master
 
04:57:37.030 --> 04:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
plan and there could be some significant
 
04:57:41.310 --> 04:57:41.320 align:start position:0%
major costs uh down the road in uh in
 
04:57:45.350 --> 04:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
the uh plan for your Solid Waste uh and
 
04:57:49.910 --> 04:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:53.788 --> 04:57:53.798 align:start position:0%

chairman representative Brown seconds
 
05:00:34.628 --> 05:00:34.638 align:start position:0%
the motion of
 
05:00:36.868 --> 05:00:36.878 align:start position:0%
itl represented McDonald would you like
 
05:00:38.190 --> 05:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
to speak to
 
05:00:45.510 --> 05:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:47.948 --> 05:00:47.958 align:start position:0%
okay this uh what happened up in Cal
 
05:00:50.110 --> 05:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
County this past year or so I guess it
 
05:00:52.628 --> 05:00:52.638 align:start position:0%
was we had a uh County building there
 
05:00:54.470 --> 05:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
was a courthouse Sheriff's Office and
 
05:00:56.350 --> 05:00:56.360 align:start position:0%
pretty much all all facilities for the
 
05:01:00.830 --> 05:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
county and uh we sold it to given it to
 
05:01:03.070 --> 05:01:03.080 align:start position:0%
uh aome Historic Society to run it for a
 
05:01:04.830 --> 05:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
dollar to put the historical thing in
 
05:01:06.910 --> 05:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
there and they backed up we couldn't
 
05:01:09.310 --> 05:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
afford to to heat the building anymore
 
05:01:11.030 --> 05:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
plus the building has got all the common
 
05:01:12.868 --> 05:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
things that you find in a 100y old
 
05:01:14.910 --> 05:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
building sounding the pipes and things
 
05:01:18.548 --> 05:01:18.558 align:start position:0%
like that so the uh County Commissioners
 
05:01:20.830 --> 05:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
decided to sell it they put an ad in the
 
05:01:23.750 --> 05:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh in the local paper it ran and they
 
05:01:26.708 --> 05:01:26.718 align:start position:0%
got two bids they got one from uh a
 
05:01:29.110 --> 05:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
charter school and another one from a
 
05:01:31.350 --> 05:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
kind of a developer that wanted to put
 
05:01:34.070 --> 05:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing or some type of
 
05:01:35.788 --> 05:01:35.798 align:start position:0%
housings or apartments and and that
 
05:01:37.350 --> 05:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
would have destroyed the entire
 
05:01:40.030 --> 05:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
character of the building itself had the
 
05:01:41.390 --> 05:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
courtroom and things like that that were
 
05:01:43.910 --> 05:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
important to the community to uh to
 
05:01:47.070 --> 05:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
remember so uh they put it in the paper
 
05:01:48.548 --> 05:01:48.558 align:start position:0%
it came before the they did the uh
 
05:01:51.150 --> 05:01:51.160 align:start position:0%
purchase and sale agreement uh the
 
05:01:52.390 --> 05:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioners brought it before the
 
05:01:55.150 --> 05:01:55.160 align:start position:0%
delegation and we voted to accept the AG
 
05:01:57.670 --> 05:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
the uh the deal for $1 with a condition
 
05:01:59.070 --> 05:01:59.080 align:start position:0%
it would stay basically the same as it
 
05:02:00.830 --> 05:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
is and if there was any issues
 
05:02:02.030 --> 05:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
financially it would come back to the
 
05:02:05.270 --> 05:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
county and that upset a few people in uh
 
05:02:08.750 --> 05:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
in some of the communities um but again
 
05:02:10.070 --> 05:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
we didn't try to hide anything it was
 
05:02:12.110 --> 05:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
done through public hearings and public
 
05:02:13.750 --> 05:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
comments and all the other things and I
 
05:02:16.350 --> 05:02:16.360 align:start position:0%
think this bill does a little bit more
 
05:02:19.350 --> 05:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
than than uh it should do this 15 days
 
05:02:21.510 --> 05:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
to do everything I think is a little uh
 
05:02:24.150 --> 05:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
outrageous what happens if uh we put
 
05:02:25.270 --> 05:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
this thing in the newspaper and there's
 
05:02:29.708 --> 05:02:29.718 align:start position:0%
13 days short to be 13 days now we've
 
05:02:30.830 --> 05:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
got to purchase and sale I'm going to
 
05:02:32.110 --> 05:02:32.120 align:start position:0%
come to the county and say now you can't
 
05:02:33.270 --> 05:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
sell it because you didn't put in the
 
05:02:36.470 --> 05:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
newspaper for for 15 days I think it
 
05:02:38.150 --> 05:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
should be left up to individual County
 
05:02:40.830 --> 05:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
to set up their own policies and rolled
 
05:02:43.788 --> 05:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
and if uh people in the community upset
 
05:02:45.470 --> 05:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
with it they can come in and tell the uh
 
05:02:46.628 --> 05:02:46.638 align:start position:0%
during the hearings for the community
 
05:02:47.990 --> 05:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
and the rules and the Commissioners
 
05:02:50.590 --> 05:02:50.600 align:start position:0%
Conde or the delegation Conde and if
 
05:02:52.230 --> 05:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
people AR happy with us then they can
 
05:02:54.788 --> 05:02:54.798 align:start position:0%
vote us out but I think this uh goes a
 
05:02:57.190 --> 05:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
little bit too far uh this particular
 
05:03:01.628 --> 05:03:01.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:04.350 --> 05:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
itl for count representative uh
 
05:03:06.830 --> 05:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
representative major thank you Mr
 
05:03:10.390 --> 05:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
chairman um ditto
 
05:03:12.830 --> 05:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
but for all the other reasons I mean to
 
05:03:15.030 --> 05:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
to pass the Bill a property was sold for
 
05:03:17.948 --> 05:03:17.958 align:start position:0%
a dollar there was no uh there was no
 
05:03:22.390 --> 05:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
appraisal done for that property um and
 
05:03:25.868 --> 05:03:25.878 align:start position:0%
and I this what this process will do is
 
05:03:28.390 --> 05:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
provide for that kind of
 
05:03:30.990 --> 05:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
transparency uh that is necessary for
 
05:03:33.910 --> 05:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
the community to the to the extent that
 
05:03:36.110 --> 05:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
you are trying to preserve the historic
 
05:03:38.948 --> 05:03:38.958 align:start position:0%
nature of of a building I completely
 
05:03:41.230 --> 05:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
agree um and I think that that is
 
05:03:43.230 --> 05:03:43.240 align:start position:0%
vitally important sometimes and I think
 
05:03:45.230 --> 05:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
people will will respect that they know
 
05:03:46.670 --> 05:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
what they will be getting I can think of
 
05:03:49.868 --> 05:03:49.878 align:start position:0%
one Community next to me um where where
 
05:03:51.510 --> 05:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
that is happening with a with an old
 
05:03:53.390 --> 05:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
theater uh hopefully it's opening
 
05:03:55.150 --> 05:03:55.160 align:start position:0%
happening with an old theater but I
 
05:03:57.628 --> 05:03:57.638 align:start position:0%
think this bill is an important process
 
05:04:00.548 --> 05:04:00.558 align:start position:0%
by which uh a community can actually
 
05:04:02.868 --> 05:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
maintain the value and I do mean that in
 
05:04:05.948 --> 05:04:05.958 align:start position:0%
all- encompassing way of of their
 
05:04:08.390 --> 05:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
property uh and still provide the
 
05:04:10.628 --> 05:04:10.638 align:start position:0%
greater transparency to to the residents
 
05:04:13.190 --> 05:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
of their Community thank you
 
05:04:15.510 --> 05:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative Brown thank you Mr
 
05:04:16.990 --> 05:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
chairman um just for everybody's
 
05:04:19.670 --> 05:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
information I'm on that same delegation
 
05:04:23.670 --> 05:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
and from uh what I saw it was a proper
 
05:04:26.030 --> 05:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
process where we did go out and get bids
 
05:04:28.548 --> 05:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
we got two bids uh we wanted to preserve
 
05:04:31.350 --> 05:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
the the historical character of the
 
05:04:33.868 --> 05:04:33.878 align:start position:0%
facility uh we were paying I think it
 
05:04:37.150 --> 05:04:37.160 align:start position:0%
was an excess of $40,000 a year just to
 
05:04:40.628 --> 05:04:40.638 align:start position:0%
keep it from deteriorating at all
 
05:04:43.110 --> 05:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
um and that there was no interest from
 
05:04:45.390 --> 05:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
anybody else other than those two biders
 
05:04:48.590 --> 05:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
in this entire process so it was costing
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
the county money to maintain it there
 
05:04:53.150 --> 05:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
was no interest in doing anything um as
 
05:04:55.270 --> 05:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:04:57.628 --> 05:04:57.638 align:start position:0%
there's the availability for charter
 
05:04:59.470 --> 05:04:59.480 align:start position:0%
schools in certain areas is not that
 
05:05:02.230 --> 05:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
great and they had agreed to keep the
 
05:05:04.310 --> 05:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
building in historical condition and
 
05:05:06.070 --> 05:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
actually they were planning to use the
 
05:05:08.548 --> 05:05:08.558 align:start position:0%
courthouse as part of their classroom
 
05:05:10.830 --> 05:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
situation so we felt it was very
 
05:05:13.390 --> 05:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
beneficial to keep that character in
 
05:05:16.070 --> 05:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
place and to reduce or eliminate the
 
05:05:19.910 --> 05:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
cost to the county of $4,000 a year U
 
05:05:22.270 --> 05:05:22.280 align:start position:0%
and and uh tried to expedite the I
 
05:05:23.750 --> 05:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say expedite but try to make a
 
05:05:26.110 --> 05:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable disposition with this
 
05:05:29.070 --> 05:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
facility and uh limit the expenses to
 
05:05:33.030 --> 05:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
the county thank you further comments
 
05:05:33.040 --> 05:05:34.708 align:start position:0%
the county thank you further comments
representative

05:05:34.708 --> 05:05:34.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:05:37.548 --> 05:05:37.558 align:start position:0%
PRI thank you Mr chairman I will be
 
05:05:40.868 --> 05:05:40.878 align:start position:0%
voting against the it on this motion I
 
05:05:44.230 --> 05:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
think this bill um makes great strives
 
05:05:45.750 --> 05:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:05:49.750 --> 05:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
transparent on the cell of property they
 
05:05:50.948 --> 05:05:50.958 align:start position:0%
want to
 
05:05:54.948 --> 05:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
dispose and um I think we uh it gives
 
05:05:59.070 --> 05:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
the community a chance to weigh in on
 
05:06:02.590 --> 05:06:02.600 align:start position:0%
the sale we have a project in Manchester
 
05:06:03.670 --> 05:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
was an old
 
05:06:05.990 --> 05:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
schoolhouse and but it was very
 
05:06:08.948 --> 05:06:08.958 align:start position:0%
important to that neighborhood and
 
05:06:10.548 --> 05:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
originally they were just going to give
 
05:06:15.310 --> 05:06:15.320 align:start position:0%
it to um another social Organization for
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
a dollar or some very minimal amount and
 
05:06:21.510 --> 05:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
there was really concerns uh of the
 
05:06:23.830 --> 05:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
community that maybe this wasn't the
 
05:06:29.670 --> 05:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
best use reuse of this facility and I
 
05:06:34.628 --> 05:06:34.638 align:start position:0%
think a bill like this um would give the
 
05:06:36.590 --> 05:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
people in the community a chance to
 
05:06:40.030 --> 05:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
weigh in and come up with the best
 
05:06:43.430 --> 05:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
reuse and uh for a particular facility
 
05:06:44.708 --> 05:06:44.718 align:start position:0%
and come up with
 
05:06:47.708 --> 05:06:47.718 align:start position:0%
restrictions that would uh preserve some
 
05:06:50.750 --> 05:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
of the if it's historical some of the
 
05:06:53.708 --> 05:06:53.718 align:start position:0%
elements that are uh that makes it that
 
05:06:57.230 --> 05:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
way and I think all of the dates that
 
05:07:01.548 --> 05:07:01.558 align:start position:0%
are in the Bill it says minimum of 15
 
05:07:04.990 --> 05:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
days um and then up to at at least 30
 
05:07:07.750 --> 05:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
days so I think a community would give
 
05:07:10.990 --> 05:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
would be very wise to give as much
 
05:07:14.110 --> 05:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
notice to the uh to the residents as
 
05:07:17.510 --> 05:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
possible so that is the reason why I
 
05:07:22.510 --> 05:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
would vote to itl this to vote against
 
05:07:25.670 --> 05:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
iing it so another motion can be raised
 
05:07:25.680 --> 05:07:26.788 align:start position:0%
iing it so another motion can be raised
thank

05:07:26.788 --> 05:07:26.798 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:07:29.110 --> 05:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
you further comments representative
 
05:07:32.310 --> 05:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman as I recall
 
05:07:34.510 --> 05:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
um from the bill hearing there are a
 
05:07:36.708 --> 05:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
number of questions and concerns with
 
05:07:40.030 --> 05:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
regards to um some of the
 
05:07:42.150 --> 05:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
um specifications within the language of
 
05:07:45.868 --> 05:07:45.878 align:start position:0%
the bill and I had the impression that
 
05:07:48.670 --> 05:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
an amendment would be forthcoming that
 
05:07:51.868 --> 05:07:51.878 align:start position:0%
some um committee members were were
 
05:07:53.628 --> 05:07:53.638 align:start position:0%
going to be reaching out to the prime
 
05:07:56.590 --> 05:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor to address those issues that
 
05:07:59.150 --> 05:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
that were raised during the hearing and
 
05:08:01.990 --> 05:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that no such attempt has
 
05:08:04.628 --> 05:08:04.638 align:start position:0%
been made and there is no Amendment for
 
05:08:07.270 --> 05:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
us to consider um for those reasons I
 
05:08:10.230 --> 05:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
will have to be supporting the it motion
 
05:08:13.070 --> 05:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you further comments
 
05:08:13.080 --> 05:08:15.470 align:start position:0%
thank you further comments
representative

05:08:15.470 --> 05:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:08:20.310 --> 05:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
lales it seems to me that that generally
 
05:08:24.590 --> 05:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
people on the committee are in favor of
 
05:08:28.310 --> 05:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
the overall goal of what this bill is
 
05:08:32.590 --> 05:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
trying to do but it seems like to me
 
05:08:35.430 --> 05:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
that there are issues with the bill as
 
05:08:37.990 --> 05:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's currently written what I would like
 
05:08:41.430 --> 05:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
to see h at this point it looks like I
 
05:08:45.470 --> 05:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
will be voting itl but would hope that
 
05:08:48.310 --> 05:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
we would come back and build a
 
05:08:51.510 --> 05:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
consensus to accomplish what the bill is
 
05:08:56.230 --> 05:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
trying to uh to address so I will be
 
05:08:59.830 --> 05:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
voting itl with the thought that the
 
05:09:02.470 --> 05:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
underlying factors of the bill that have
 
05:09:05.750 --> 05:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
been expressed really need to be
 
05:09:08.910 --> 05:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
addressed thank you thank you further
 
05:09:08.920 --> 05:09:11.190 align:start position:0%
addressed thank you thank you further
comments

05:09:11.190 --> 05:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
comments
 
05:09:14.190 --> 05:09:14.200 align:start position:0%
questions uh quick comment from
 
05:09:17.670 --> 05:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
myself agree 100% with the last two uh
 
05:09:21.230 --> 05:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
speakers um there are many issues that
 
05:09:23.670 --> 05:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
throughout the hearing we a lot of us
 
05:09:26.230 --> 05:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
questioned um from both sides of the
 
05:09:28.628 --> 05:09:28.638 align:start position:0%
aisle the definition of realtor I saw
 
05:09:30.350 --> 05:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
something that somebody said that's
 
05:09:32.750 --> 05:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
actually not um the the real term we
 
05:09:35.150 --> 05:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
need to be in there the 2/3 majority
 
05:09:37.910 --> 05:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
that was a question minimum of 15 days
 
05:09:39.548 --> 05:09:39.558 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of us thought that needed to be
 
05:09:42.110 --> 05:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
more 30 days for the next one we thought
 
05:09:44.230 --> 05:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
that one should be more qualified
 
05:09:47.470 --> 05:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
appraiser who's a qualified appraiser um
 
05:09:51.310 --> 05:09:51.320 align:start position:0%
I I also agree with where the intent is
 
05:09:54.590 --> 05:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
going with this uh but it's just there's
 
05:09:56.070 --> 05:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
just too many issues and as
 
05:09:58.670 --> 05:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
representative power said U I was
 
05:10:00.310 --> 05:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
expecting an amendment and I kept
 
05:10:02.230 --> 05:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
wondering when and if it was coming and
 
05:10:05.030 --> 05:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
it never came so for that reason alone I
 
05:10:07.548 --> 05:10:07.558 align:start position:0%
I have to vote itl on
 
05:10:09.868 --> 05:10:09.878 align:start position:0%
it representative p
 
05:10:12.230 --> 05:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh point of inquiry wouldn't it be
 
05:10:15.788 --> 05:10:15.798 align:start position:0%
better since we're pretty much all in
 
05:10:19.830 --> 05:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
favor of the concept of this bill to
 
05:10:22.390 --> 05:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
vote down the itl and put this as an
 
05:10:25.270 --> 05:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
interim study so maybe we could get an
 
05:10:27.948 --> 05:10:27.958 align:start position:0%
amendment back that addresses all of
 
05:10:27.958 --> 05:10:28.990 align:start position:0%
amendment back that addresses all of
these

05:10:28.990 --> 05:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:10:32.670 --> 05:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
concerns the current motion on the table
 
05:10:35.230 --> 05:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
is itl we we'll do that motion and then
 
05:10:38.230 --> 05:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
we can proceed from there how's
 
05:10:38.240 --> 05:10:40.510 align:start position:0%
we can proceed from there how's
that

05:10:40.510 --> 05:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:10:42.788 --> 05:10:42.798 align:start position:0%

yes as I previous thank you Mr chairman
 
05:13:15.708 --> 05:13:15.718 align:start position:0%
as I previously said there are many
 
05:13:18.590 --> 05:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
things about this bill that we all can
 
05:13:20.910 --> 05:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
agree upon and we all think are
 
05:13:23.310 --> 05:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
important but there are some things that
 
05:13:25.788 --> 05:13:25.798 align:start position:0%
we need to tweak and I think we can use
 
05:13:28.510 --> 05:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
this time to tweak those items and get
 
05:13:30.990 --> 05:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
them correct thank

05:13:57.868 --> 05:13:57.878 align:start position:0%
deemed it was important could use that
 
05:14:01.390 --> 05:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
interim study to on those bills that
 
05:14:04.750 --> 05:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
could be corrected am I I will have to
 
05:14:07.150 --> 05:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
look in I do not believe that's the case
 
05:14:09.830 --> 05:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
but I can I will check with clerk I okay
 
05:14:11.990 --> 05:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
I believe interim study is
 
05:14:15.590 --> 05:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
simply um you get together and then the
 
05:14:17.830 --> 05:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
chairman decides or the committee
 
05:14:19.990 --> 05:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
whatever decides on whether or not they
 
05:14:24.548 --> 05:14:24.558 align:start position:0%
recommend further study in the future or
 
05:14:27.830 --> 05:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh future legislation that's my
 
05:14:29.390 --> 05:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
understanding thank you but I will
 
05:14:31.310 --> 05:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
double check for you so anyway uh sorry
 
05:14:33.470 --> 05:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
to interrupt uh further comments on the
 
05:14:36.390 --> 05:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
inter room study representative
 
05:14:39.510 --> 05:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
yella yes um
 
05:14:42.670 --> 05:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
it's been said multiple times that
 
05:14:45.390 --> 05:14:45.400 align:start position:0%
everyone thinks that this is uh has some
 
05:14:50.110 --> 05:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
Merit and I just wanted to uh voice my
 
05:14:53.590 --> 05:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
opposition to the whole idea of this
 
05:14:56.390 --> 05:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
bill and so that I'm on the record that
 
05:14:58.190 --> 05:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
I don't actually think that there is
 
05:15:00.150 --> 05:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
anything to fix because I don't think
 
05:15:02.310 --> 05:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
there is actually a problem that the
 
05:15:04.708 --> 05:15:04.718 align:start position:0%
that the bill sponsor essentially said
 
05:15:06.150 --> 05:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
that they were asleep at the wheel when
 
05:15:09.548 --> 05:15:09.558 align:start position:0%
they were voting and this is not going
 
05:15:12.948 --> 05:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
to wake them up right they need if they
 
05:15:16.190 --> 05:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
didn't pay attention to the vote that's
 
05:15:19.548 --> 05:15:19.558 align:start position:0%
whether it's three fourths requirement
 
05:15:23.990 --> 05:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
or a a unanimous requirement if they're
 
05:15:25.788 --> 05:15:25.798 align:start position:0%
just not paying attention then it's
 
05:15:29.190 --> 05:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
going to end up still passing the same
 
05:15:31.070 --> 05:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
way and they they're going to have some
 
05:15:33.990 --> 05:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
regret and that's what happens when
 
05:15:35.670 --> 05:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
you're not paying attention so I don't
 
05:15:37.470 --> 05:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
actually think that any legislation on
 
05:15:41.590 --> 05:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:44.590 --> 05:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
representative Elward um point of
 
05:15:46.910 --> 05:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
information Mr
 
05:15:50.628 --> 05:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
chairman other committees hold work
 
05:15:55.670 --> 05:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:58.470 --> 05:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
session I I look at work session I was
 
05:16:04.190 --> 05:16:04.200 align:start position:0%
on labor um and for a couple one term
 
05:16:07.910 --> 05:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
Finance I don't recall us doing work
 
05:16:10.510 --> 05:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
sessions and you guys do in labor we
 
05:16:14.990 --> 05:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
never did I I see work sessions
 
05:16:18.070 --> 05:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
as kind of what we do here we discuss
 
05:16:20.788 --> 05:16:20.798 align:start position:0%
before we exec a bill a work session
 
05:16:23.868 --> 05:16:23.878 align:start position:0%
would be to get together I think discuss
 
05:16:27.948 --> 05:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
it in advance of coming to an exec
 
05:16:30.390 --> 05:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
session that's how I would see it we do
 
05:16:33.910 --> 05:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
our no well well that's how I understand
 
05:16:35.910 --> 05:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
it anyway that's that's the way I have
 
05:16:37.788 --> 05:16:37.798 align:start position:0%
looked at it that's the way I have kind
 
05:16:39.510 --> 05:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
of run the committee
 
05:16:43.590 --> 05:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
um we each have our caucuses to discuss
 
05:16:47.910 --> 05:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
the bills and then we come here and
 
05:16:51.470 --> 05:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
um so that's how I see it whether
 
05:16:54.310 --> 05:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
it's the way to run it or not that's the
 
05:16:57.628 --> 05:16:57.638 align:start position:0%
way I've chosen to run it representative
 
05:17:00.390 --> 05:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
05:17:03.390 --> 05:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
spear uh I'm on usually on Commerce and
 
05:17:05.910 --> 05:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
commerce has work sessions all the time
 
05:17:08.470 --> 05:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
but the work session happens before the
 
05:17:10.510 --> 05:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
execu session it happens after the
 
05:17:13.510 --> 05:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
hearing before the exec session in which
 
05:17:15.430 --> 05:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
we all get together and say this is what
 
05:17:17.430 --> 05:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
we heard let's get some more information
 
05:17:19.230 --> 05:17:19.240 align:start position:0%
let's modify the bill let's do what we
 
05:17:21.350 --> 05:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
can to make it right so when we go to
 
05:17:24.270 --> 05:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
the exec session it's just one right
 
05:17:25.990 --> 05:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
after the other you know everything's
 
05:17:27.830 --> 05:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
been hashed out already so once we've
 
05:17:29.590 --> 05:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
gone to exact we we don't go back to
 
05:17:29.600 --> 05:17:34.030 align:start position:0%
gone to exact we we don't go back to
work

05:17:34.030 --> 05:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
