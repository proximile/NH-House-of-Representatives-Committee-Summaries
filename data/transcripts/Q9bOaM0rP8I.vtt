00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
amendment um it's
 
00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:30.039 align:start position:0%
20242 3 6h but it was prepared by the
 
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor representative Kaplan but
 
00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
it does a great job of addressing the
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
issues that came forth in the public
 
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
hearing it limits this mapping to just
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
State Forest um it has a de definite
 
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
timeline which addresses some of the
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
costs um so Mr chair if I could indulge
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
you to ask the committee to spend a
 
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
minute just looking on this I think it
 
00:25:54.669 --> 00:25:54.679 align:start position:0%
would address a lot of the issues that
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%

uh we if the oh if I if the itl Was
 
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
Defeated guess we would look at that but
 
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
I would I would allow I would allow for

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
Dees uh and it's enabling legislation it
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
is an all after the enacting Clause I
 
00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
believe let me just bring it back up um
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
yeah it's all after the enacting Clause
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
so it takes into account their feedback
 
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
it enables towns should they choose and
 
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
only if they vote Yes on two issues one
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
is wanting to transfer it and also
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
wanting to uh fund it and if either
 
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
question fails by the local governing
 
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
body whatever that may be um then the
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
offer to transfer the dam would be
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
rejected so both tests have to pass and
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's enabling legislation to allow
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
localities to control and perhaps
 
00:35:58.309 --> 00:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
improve their own infrastructure if they
 
00:35:58.319 --> 00:35:59.190 align:start position:0%
improve their own infrastructure if they
want

00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
to and that was the feedback we got and
 
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
does representative Derby thank you Mr
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
chair with um with one minor
 
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
clarification that if it if it fails the
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
municipality the department um may offer
 
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:18.280 align:start position:0%
it to an association of land owners or
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
any interested parties registered as a
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
public entity um so there is there is an
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
an option and um the amendment also
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh address the concern that I have about
 
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
um about how to vet those um non-public
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
and or those um those private uh
 
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
landowner associations that um before
 
00:36:44.589 --> 00:36:44.599 align:start position:0%
the uh before the loan is offered they
 
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
financially representative M thank you
 
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:53.839 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um one last thing I forgot
 
00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
to mention is it does establish that
 
00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund but funds it at at a dollar uh
 
00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
so this bill presumably will go to
 
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
finance and they'll have a look at it
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
and might get considered the next budget
 
00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
year or who knows uh but there isn't a a
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
funding beyond that that dollar to to
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
make loans so the municipality would
 
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:15.079 align:start position:0%
have to figure out basically how to how
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
to fund it if they wanted to do whatever
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
their governing body chooses they
 
00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
do any other any other question I well
 
00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
let me let me first off um I have a
 
00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:27.470 align:start position:0%
let me let me first off um I have a
concern

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
that not everybody has a copy of
 
00:37:35.069 --> 00:37:35.079 align:start position:0%
this this in front of them
 
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
uh is is these copy machines still still
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
broken upstairs
 
00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
yeah if you every what you could you
 
00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:49.640 align:start position:0%
could take my copy
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.599 --> 00:37:59.349 align:start position:0%
 
down

00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:19.480 align:start position:0%

minutes while we we wait uh one one
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
additional thing we're going to run into
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
another there's
 
00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.470 align:start position:0%

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:41.480 align:start position:0%

00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:45.319 align:start position:0%
hello there's another memo there there's
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
I received a memo that there's
 
00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
another uh
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that also wants to be uh to
 
00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
this bill however it was built around
 
00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.109 align:start position:0%
this bill however it was built around
the

00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
original U the the bill as originally
 
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
put forth we will take that up unless
 
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
you you wish to remove that
 
00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.190 align:start position:0%
you you wish to remove that
representative

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
lante um no well it was built around the
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
amendment but the paragraph that was
 
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
affected is the same in all versions of
 
00:39:23.309 --> 00:39:23.319 align:start position:0%
the amendment okay of the bill and the
 
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
amendment okay well that's the reason I
 
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
called the the the uh the big Amendment
 
00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
first was because I was concerned that
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
yes uh if we had if if we put your
 
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
amendment in it or if if your amendment
 
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
was successful and the Second Amendment
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
the big Amendment came in it would wipe
 
00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:47.670 align:start position:0%
the big Amendment came in it would wipe
that

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
out thank you Mr chairman just to to
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
clarify parliamentary wise the motion on
 
00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
the floor is ought to pass as amended
 
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
with amended 0227 yes if if that passes
 
00:39:58.589 --> 00:39:58.599 align:start position:0%
it would then potentially be open to
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
further Amendment or not yes it would
 
00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so do we need to take action
 
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
on the motion on the floor uh yes we
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%

relative uh to environmental surity

bonds and for businesses that pose a
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
significant risk to the state's natural
 
00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:49.109 align:start position:0%
significant risk to the state's natural
resources

00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:49.119 align:start position:0%

00:41:57.069 --> 00:41:57.079 align:start position:0%
for a motion
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
itl do I have a
 
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
chair you like to speak on your motion
 
00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:12.839 align:start position:0%
yes I
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
would um well I really appreciate the
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
attent of this bill to make polluters um
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
pay um I there were a lot of problems
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
with the bill um first it was really
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
overly broad um referring to um anybody
 
00:42:33.549 --> 00:42:33.559 align:start position:0%
who works in an industry that may
 
00:42:38.109 --> 00:42:38.119 align:start position:0%
pollute the soil water um or air might
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
be subject to the shity bond and it
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
seemed that um in order for this the
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
bond to be truly a deterrent from
 
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
pollution it would have to be enormous
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
not to be written off as an upfront
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
business expense that the industry may
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
be willing to pay and then go on
 
00:43:04.109 --> 00:43:04.119 align:start position:0%
polluting for 30 years making enormous
 
00:43:08.549 --> 00:43:08.559 align:start position:0%
profits um it seems that bonds work
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
better to have an industry do something
 
00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
good like the last house my husband and
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
I built we had a bond to plant some
 
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
trees um which we did and then we were
 
00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:22.829 align:start position:0%
trees um which we did and then we were
paid

00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:22.839 align:start position:0%
paid
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
back um but ultimately seems like the
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
best way to pre is to prevent the
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
pollution in the first place rather than
 
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
to put out a bond to make the polluters
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.349 --> 00:43:46.359 align:start position:0%
afterwards so that is my perspective
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
that we need to instead of doing the
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%

you might want to say
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
any on
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
the thank you Mr chairman so the mo the
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
motion I've made is that the committee
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
that the committee
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
adopt Amendment 20240 227h for House
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 1429 now everybody has a hard copy
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
was emailed yesterday he's a hard copy
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
now and it was this was the discussion
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
it made a couple of points that it was
 
00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
enabling uh that it requires the test to
 
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
the governmental body to accept to to
 
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
agree to accept it and fund it and there
 
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
as representative Derby pointed out
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
there's some alternate mechanisms of
 
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
funding uh as well and the Loan Fund is
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
funded at at a dollar so essentially un
 
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
unfunded at that point if if you and
 
00:48:38.829 --> 00:48:38.839 align:start position:0%
that would only come into play if the
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
municipality wanted a loan right or need
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
needed to apply for a loan so at some
 
00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
future date that could be funded by
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
Finance or another
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%

open a further Amendment yeah yes but
 
00:50:46.109 --> 00:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
first i'm looking at the further
 
00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
Amendment the further Amendment
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it came in based
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
on it's it has amend the bill by
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
replacing all after the enacting Clause
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
so what we just did would be erased by
 
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
this amendment we be back to the
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
beginning there could I speak to that
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
for a moment uh yes I don't if we before
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
we before I accept the
 
00:51:17.549 --> 00:51:17.559 align:start position:0%
amendment if we say because my amendment
 
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
was based on the original amendment by
 
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
representative Mur which was changed
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
just last night that if we just say that
 
00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
my amendment is based on the amendment
 
00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.829 align:start position:0%
my amendment is based on the amendment
just

00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
adopted my amendment is only one line I
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
I realize but the only the only thing
 
00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
that I had received up until this point
 
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
was not what you what has been presented
 
00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:51.799 align:start position:0%
here it was only thing I received
 
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
was the after line 17
 
00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
after Downstream and add other words
 
00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
adding that section I thought that would
 
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:03.400 align:start position:0%
be the
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
amendment I did too all I asked OS was
 
00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
to add that one line I didn't realize
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
they were going to
 
00:52:13.549 --> 00:52:13.559 align:start position:0%
say replace the whole thing because I
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
did only change one
 
00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
line I I realized
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
but where is
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
the where is I
 
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:25.910 align:start position:0%
the where is I
uh

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
committee uh committee
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
researcher we
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
can't if we adopt this
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment first huh no it has not it has
 
00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:45.640 align:start position:0%
not been moved okay I'm just looking at
 
00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing I'm in a situation
 
00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:51.640 align:start position:0%
where this is a this amendment wipes out
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment we just voted which
 
00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:57.640 align:start position:0%
is changes several
 
00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:59.230 align:start position:0%
is changes several
things

00:52:59.230 --> 00:52:59.240 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh so what I have to do we'd have to do
 
00:53:08.349 --> 00:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
is I can allow you to uh get back to OS
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible and get another
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
amendment or get the amendment such that
 
00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
it does not
 
00:53:17.789 --> 00:53:17.799 align:start position:0%
interfere or or like like it was
 
00:53:21.789 --> 00:53:21.799 align:start position:0%
originally put in to just mentioning the
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
spot where it would go in and and
 
00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
uh then we would that we would then
 
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
continue with this the uh the hearing on
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
this on on this I'd have to postpone the
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
hearing till later on in the day ex the
 
00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:40.510 align:start position:0%
hearing till later on in the day ex the
executive

00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
executive
 
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
session um would it be possible for me
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
to suggest an amendment should it pass
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
and go to the Senate that I amended at
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
that stage well definitely you could
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
also sub I don't want to hold everything
 
00:53:57.789 --> 00:53:57.799 align:start position:0%
up you could also uh you could also oh
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
there's a spider on
 
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
it I gave it
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
to uh you can do it as a floor
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment and you could do it as a yeah
 
00:54:10.829 --> 00:54:10.839 align:start position:0%
you could do it as a floor Amendment
 
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
Finance or in finance it would be
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
there okay so you wish to withdraw it
 
00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:28.829 --> 00:54:28.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
on I guess the motion is ought to pass
 
00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
as amended as
 
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:40.880 align:start position:0%

04045 HBA
 
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
1045 relative to requiring a Powerbolt
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
operator to wear an engine cut off
 
00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
switch while operating certain power
 
00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
bolts traveling over Headway
 
00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:53.079 align:start position:0%
speed they're recognized as
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
representative done for a motion
 
00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:57.640 align:start position:0%
I make a motion ought to
 
00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
pass motion is ought to pass is there a
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
second second by representative rung

would you like to speak to your
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
motion yes I think this is a safety
 
00:58:11.789 --> 00:58:11.799 align:start position:0%
issue and something that um we should
 
00:58:14.109 --> 00:58:14.119 align:start position:0%
have so I think it's it'll prevent the
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
boats from going in circles and we
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
should we should do
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
this would you like to speak to your a
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
second um I'll just say that the
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
testimony given by captain Levy was very
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
powerful about the need for this and um
 
00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:29.559 align:start position:0%
also just want to note that I'm a
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on this Bill thank
 
00:58:35.029 --> 00:58:35.039 align:start position:0%

00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:40.440 align:start position:0%

on this bill and it will save lives and
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
that's what we're doing here is trying
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
to save lives and I imagine that the
 
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances where this will be helpful
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
will be be helpful for everyone involved
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%

00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair this is uh definitely an
 
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
important bill um and I think that it
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
will um help to save lives and help to
 
00:59:20.349 --> 00:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
keep people safe um as I expressed
 
00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
during my questions um I I do have one
 
00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
very small concern um with the bill
 
00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
which has to do with um people trolling
 
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
um above what I uh as I interpret the
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
language Headway speed meaning the um
 
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
the speed where no wake is produced
 
00:59:44.029 --> 00:59:44.039 align:start position:0%
people troll up to three and a half
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
miles an hour which um can and often
 
00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:49.720 align:start position:0%
does produce a small wake that same
 
00:59:54.069 --> 00:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
Headway speed language is used in um uh
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
in no wake zones and you wouldn't be
 
00:59:59.670 --> 00:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
allowed to go um produce that size wake
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
in a no wake zone as um Captain Dunley
 
01:00:06.349 --> 01:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
um testified um that's not the intent of
 
01:00:08.349 --> 01:00:08.359 align:start position:0%
this bill um and I think this bill
 
01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
should pass however I um if I were to
 
01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
vote against it it would be just to
 
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
express my concern that that Clause
 
01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:18.799 align:start position:0%
should be added to um the language um so
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
that it could be considered by the
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.559 --> 01:00:25.430 align:start position:0%

motion of itl on this
 
01:02:52.349 --> 01:02:52.359 align:start position:0%
bill is there a
 
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
second I'll second it
 
01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
who was
 
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
okay you wish to speak on your motion
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
yes I do Mr chair thank you um so I just
 
01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
had a couple of concerns with this bill
 
01:03:12.549 --> 01:03:12.559 align:start position:0%
um and I don't want
 
01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
to make a flat out
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
um ban
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
or just go ahead and pass a bill that
 
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
releases any um accountability between
 
01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
boat owners and so when I thought about
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
this I thought you know how do private
 
01:03:34.109 --> 01:03:34.119 align:start position:0%
property owners receive uh what do they
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
do how is it determined who has the
 
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
right of
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
way when it comes to leaving their docks
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
and the other thing was that um we don't
 
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
have a really clear
 
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
definition of the toileting facilities
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
on these boats so um at this point point
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
I think the emails were really
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
compelling um and we're really concerned
 
01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
about the health of the laks so I would
 
01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
like to see um something that is more of
 
01:04:08.549 --> 01:04:08.559 align:start position:0%
a compromise um than this bill puts
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
forth thank you Mr chair for the
 
01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
speak representative D wish to speak on
 
01:04:20.349 --> 01:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
your second yeah I'll just say this
 
01:04:22.349 --> 01:04:22.359 align:start position:0%
committee received over 200 emails
 
01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:25.039 align:start position:0%
against this and my constituent spoke
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
loud and clear that they did not want
 
01:04:26.559 --> 01:04:28.549 align:start position:0%
loud and clear that they did not want
this

01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:04:32.029 --> 01:04:32.039 align:start position:0%
so representative L montin
 
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
for um should speak yes I I will vote
 
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
for the itl but I did want to speak to
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
the bill because I I had some concerns
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
about the bill the bill well statute now
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
still allows overnight Moorings and
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
houseboats on these bodies of water but
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
only if associated with property on the
 
01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:00.839 align:start position:0%
shore either by that owner or by a
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
friend of theirs with
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
permission and the water does belong to
 
01:05:08.589 --> 01:05:08.599 align:start position:0%
everybody I was disturbed by some of the
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
language in the email
 
01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
suggesting that I don't want house boats
 
01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
in front of my property as if they own
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
the water as well and they
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
don't my other issue is that I I once
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
lived on a house boat myself for one
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
winter on an inland waterway in the city
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
of Boston and for three Summers where I
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
was a seasonal worker and it was
 
01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
affordable housing for me and we have a
 
01:05:39.309 --> 01:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
housing problem in New Hampshire
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
especially in the in the Lakes region in
 
01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:43.720 align:start position:0%
the Summer where they need workers who
 
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
can't find a place to live and work for
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
the season but I did feel the bill
 
01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:49.990 align:start position:0%
the season but I did feel the bill
didn't

01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
really address the many concerns we
 
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
would have about
 
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
sanitation but most of the complaints
 
01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:58.430 align:start position:0%
sanitation but most of the complaints
about

01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
noise are happening already with party
 
01:06:03.309 --> 01:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
boats this has nothing to do with party
 
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
boats going around the lake at night so
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
I hope that this bill can come back with
 
01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps a very complicated way that we
 
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
can look at protecting water quality and
 
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
also providing opportunities for
 
01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.789 align:start position:0%
also providing opportunities for
seasonal

01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
seasonal
 
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
housing um
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
so that's I just wanted to say that
 
01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:27.710 align:start position:0%
so that's I just wanted to say that
about

01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:32.559 align:start position:0%

Bill second by rep representative Healey
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
oh you wish to speak to your motion yes
 
01:09:46.669 --> 01:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you very much um as was
 
01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
explained during the public hearing what
 
01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
this bill does is it allows the
 
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services to
 
01:09:56.189 --> 01:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
enforce violations of the shoreline
 
01:09:59.470 --> 01:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
protection water quality act um
 
01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
presently the statute really complicates
 
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
their ability to enforce because it
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
requires them to demonstrate that
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
there's been damage to a water body and
 
01:10:11.310 --> 01:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
many times that damage may take years
 
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
it's cumulative with other actions so um
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
it right now the only change this makes
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
the statute is it maintains the language
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
it says persons violating the provisions
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
of this chapter
 
01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
shall be subject to the following and it
 
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
maintains all the current enforcement
 
01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
actions but it deletes the language that
 
01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
says and damaging the public water way
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
who after notification by the department
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
failed to make a good faith effort at
 
01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:39.640 align:start position:0%
remediation and
 
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
restoration that that language um that
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is proposing to eliminate has
 
01:10:47.709 --> 01:10:47.719 align:start position:0%
really complicated the process of
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement because it puts the burden
 
01:10:53.709 --> 01:10:53.719 align:start position:0%
on the state to determine what good
 
01:10:57.229 --> 01:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
faith means um in addition to the issue
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
I brought up about um assessing damage
 
01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
to a water body so this has the support
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
um I think you know when we heard
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
testimony um from Darlene forest from
 
01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
she explained some situations where
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
they've been handcuffed and I did
 
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
believe I do believe she sent an email
 
01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
out within the last couple days um I
 
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
think it was to you representative
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
Harvey bolo um asked for other examples
 
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
she sent four other examples which
 
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
really documents the need to have this
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
you yours to speak dear
 
01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
second I think she covered it pretty
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
well um I just wanted to add that there
 
01:11:41.709 --> 01:11:41.719 align:start position:0%
some of the companies or entities that
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
have uh uh done this numerous times that
 
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
so anyone else wish to speak to the bill
 
01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:54.350 align:start position:0%
so anyone else wish to speak to the bill
representative

01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I I believe this
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
is a critical bill and it's really
 
01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
important and some of the egregious
 
01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
violations that we were presented with
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
make it really a much more important
 
01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
bill and um these violations can now be
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
pursued and the owners and violators can
 
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
be held accountable thank you for
 
01:12:18.189 --> 01:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
bringing this
 
01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
forth representative Darby for a thank
 
01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair just expanding on
 
01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
representative Run's remarks very
 
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
briefly um we heard that uh in order for
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh Dees to enforce the current statute
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
they have to prove damage the entire
 
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
water body which is impossible um they
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
they said it is impossible on water
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
bodies the size of Lake sanap or lake
 
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
winaki in addition we heard and uh
 
01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
examples were provided of how Department
 
01:12:47.950 --> 01:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services wants to work
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
with property owners in order to um
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
mitigate they're not looking to find
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
people except when the those um those
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
parties are not willing to um to abide
 
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
abide by the um Shoreline protection act
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
so this is this is a critical
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh tool um but would only be
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%

01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
happened when you get too many pieces of

paper passing along you can have you got
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%

on line 20 the last four words of line
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
20 or provide required information this
 
01:16:24.990 --> 01:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
closes um what I perceive as a loophole
 
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
in uh the original Bill where the um
 
01:16:31.229 --> 01:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
owner of the vessel doesn't have to um
 
01:16:35.070 --> 01:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
provide a report until after the 15-day
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh period for reporting the accident
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
um this would say this would indicate
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
that if the operator of the vessel um
 
01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
did not or was not able to provide the
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
information either providing it to the
 
01:16:53.790 --> 01:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
um operator of the other vessel or the
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
property that was damaged or reporting
 
01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
it to Marine Patrol then the um then the
 
01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
owner of the vessel would need to
 
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
provide that as soon as they were U made
 
01:17:11.629 --> 01:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%

loophole and closing it because that
 
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
would be a significant issue for Marine
 
01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
Patrol um for the boat owner to be to
 
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%

septic designer I have been for nearly
 
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
30 years um as my sons are um which I'm
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
proud of that also the when we are
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
looking at a new piece of land that it's
 
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
never been developed and a test pit is
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
dug to figure out where the water the
 
01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
seasonal high water is in the ground uh
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's determined by permitted septic
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
designers and soil scientists once that
 
01:28:10.350 --> 01:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
level is found then the new septic
 
01:28:13.390 --> 01:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
system for the first time is built 4
 
01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
feet above the bottom of it is 4 feet
 
01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
above that seasonal high water I I do
 
01:28:21.149 --> 01:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
have to tell you when you dig a hole in
 
01:28:23.229 --> 01:28:23.239 align:start position:0%
the ground and you looking for water and
 
01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
you find water that isn't necessarily
 
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
the seasonal high water there's
 
01:28:31.189 --> 01:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
fluctuation in the spring in the summer
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
water water table goes deeper comes up
 
01:28:37.390 --> 01:28:37.400 align:start position:0%
but over the course of 20 years or so a
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
profile is developed in the soil
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
coloring texture and so forth and the
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
skill of that Designer that soil
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
scientists is what determines that so if
 
01:28:52.669 --> 01:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
if the water table this seasonal high
 
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
water was at grade here on the floor you
 
01:28:59.350 --> 01:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
would have to build somewhere at this
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
height over a number of years septic
 
01:29:05.669 --> 01:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
systems don't last forever and um they
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
used to last a lot longer in the past
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
but because now with the heavy
 
01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
detergents medications we take um and
 
01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing the lifespan of
 
01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:17.800 align:start position:0%
septic system is much
 
01:29:20.270 --> 01:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
shorter so the state has always
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
developed a policy that the first time
 
01:29:26.189 --> 01:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
it's built here uh the second time you
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
evaluate the soil again but instead of
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
four feet it comes down to two feet
 
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
water what this um what this does is in
 
01:29:41.470 --> 01:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
the first place when you go to design
 
01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
septic systems and you use what is
 
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
considered the standard tried and true
 
01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
method in our state which is Stone
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
aggregate clean Stone uh three 3/4 in to
 
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
2 in as long as you're you're using that
 
01:29:59.550 --> 01:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
material and you are putting 6 in of
 
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
sand under it which helps with treatment
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
the first design can go back at two foot
 
01:30:06.910 --> 01:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
above seasonal high water as it would be
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
if if the system were to fail the stone
 
01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
and pipe system works so well because
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's larger than the other systems that
 
01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
are out there there's great voids
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
between the stone and the sand is is a
 
01:30:24.149 --> 01:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
great agent so how does that help
 
01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
housing um many of you um my age or
 
01:30:30.149 --> 01:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
older know that uh as you drive around
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
the good land is gone you're working on
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
lots that are just not as s you know
 
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:39.400 align:start position:0%
acable to uh new
 
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
systems many times if you have to
 
01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
develop a septic system to build a de
 
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
septic system up here for a homeowner
 
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
that involves having to add a pump into
 
01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
the system a large larger septic tank
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
and so forth and that in turn in today's
 
01:30:58.910 --> 01:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
money this wasn't the case 20 years ago
 
01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
but in today's money adds thousands of
 
01:31:04.629 --> 01:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
dollars into that initial
 
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
install if you're trying to develop
 
01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
homes and you're trying to keep some
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
cost down one of one of those major
 
01:31:16.109 --> 01:31:16.119 align:start position:0%
Investments is a septic system and by
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
permitting the septic system to be lower
 
01:31:23.109 --> 01:31:23.119 align:start position:0%
in the ground and a house on a on a
 
01:31:26.830 --> 01:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
traditional plane allows the sewer to
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
leave the house and go by gravity into
 
01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
the ground into the system it it doesn't
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen every time but many times
 
01:31:39.709 --> 01:31:39.719 align:start position:0%
it will so it came out of a great
 
01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation out of U out of the uh
 
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
special housing committee to back this
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a great list of uh
 
01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
supporters that are co-sponsors on here
 
01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:53.030 align:start position:0%
supporters that are co-sponsors on here
and

01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
and that is the emphasis of what we are
 
01:31:57.550 --> 01:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding that the
 
01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
department um the department will uh
 
01:32:03.390 --> 01:32:03.400 align:start position:0%
speak afterwards and uh will be in
 
01:32:05.109 --> 01:32:05.119 align:start position:0%
support I'm more than happy to take
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
questions if I gloss over something for
 
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative any
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
R thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
represent Muki for taking my question so
 
01:32:22.229 --> 01:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
if I'm to understand this so when the
 
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
initial design goes in it has to be 4
 
01:32:27.590 --> 01:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
feet above the high seasonal High
 
01:32:30.030 --> 01:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
Watermark correct but if that is
 
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
replaced then it only has to go be 2
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
feet above so this bill would just
 
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
require 2 feet at the very beginning is
 
01:32:39.149 --> 01:32:39.159 align:start position:0%
that correct that is correct
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative providing you're using
 
01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
stone stone and pipe or Stone Chambers
 
01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
okay kind a followup Mr chair thank you
 
01:32:49.229 --> 01:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
and you also mentioned something which
 
01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
kind of perked my curiosity you said
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
that septic systems today don't last as
 
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
long because of medication and our
 
01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
detergents could you explain why the um
 
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
I I'd be happy to and thank you for the
 
01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
question and I'm sure the department
 
01:33:06.189 --> 01:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
will have a better answer than mine um
 
01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
the septic system operates uh uh
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
anerobic without air and with air so
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
when the so when it's sitting in the
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
tank and it's breaking down and going
 
01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
through the biologic anding papers waste
 
01:33:24.669 --> 01:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
and so forth it it's Anor iic there and
 
01:33:27.790 --> 01:33:27.800 align:start position:0%
when you upset that chemistry how quick
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
things will break down inside that
 
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
concrete tank and you introduce a lot of
 
01:33:36.189 --> 01:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
medications uh it it will cause the
 
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
system to stop working and die basically
 
01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:45.400 align:start position:0%
in in the tank um the strong detergents
 
01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
do prevent the bacterial activity to
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
happen in there again to break down
 
01:33:53.310 --> 01:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
you're trying to break down uh nitrates
 
01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
phosphates all those things before it
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
gets out into the field and
 
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um it's having a great
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
effect also uh Hollywood showers we have
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
teenagers they jump in the shower and
 
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
they generate a tremendous amount of
 
01:34:11.149 --> 01:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
water that flows through the system and
 
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
it short circuits the biology and pushes
 
01:34:16.109 --> 01:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
it out but but two of the major things
 
01:34:18.109 --> 01:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
are medications unfortunately you can't
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
control that and strong
 
01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:22.629 align:start position:0%
control that and strong
detergents

01:34:22.629 --> 01:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
detergents
 
01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for the
 
01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you for
 
01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you Mr
 
01:34:33.109 --> 01:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
chairman next I have from the dees
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
trobridge hello good morning uh Mr chair
 
01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for the
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
record my name is Philip tro bridge I'm
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
the L the manager of the land resources
 
01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
program at New Hampshire Dees of which
 
01:35:00.270 --> 01:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
the subsurface systems Bureau is a part
 
01:35:01.950 --> 01:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
um representative makoni did a great
 
01:35:04.510 --> 01:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
introduction to this bill regarding um
 
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
seasonal High the you seasonal high
 
01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:08.360 align:start position:0%
water table and the reasons behind it
 
01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
and the um this recommendation coming
 
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
out of the special committee for housing
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
uh I will not repeat that uh the
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
department does support this bill um we
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
have looked at it in terms of water
 
01:35:21.790 --> 01:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
quality because obviously the question
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
is is there is this going to cause some
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
sort of problem of water quality and and
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
u based on our 50 years of experience
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
with septic systems we do not believe
 
01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
that is the case we've had many cases
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
where systems have been put in with the
 
01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
two feet of separation for a replacement
 
01:35:40.709 --> 01:35:40.719 align:start position:0%
as representative mikoni mentioned and
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
as long as there is this six inches of
 
01:35:44.830 --> 01:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
sand which is really what does the heavy
 
01:35:47.229 --> 01:35:47.239 align:start position:0%
lifting of treatment for a stone and
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
pipe septic system uh we have found that
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
that is AD provides adequate treatment
 
01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
for on-site
 
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
Wastewater uh we also have a lot of
 
01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
experience um with other types of
 
01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
systems uh there are Innovative
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
Technologies some of you may be familiar
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
with that are allowed to have reduced
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
separation to the groundwater and in
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
some cases even a smaller leech field
 
01:36:11.790 --> 01:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
than a conventional system uh and again
 
01:36:13.950 --> 01:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
those systems have uh proven to be
 
01:36:16.590 --> 01:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
effective at treating waste uh so
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
looking at the the fact that we have a a
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
housing you know challenge in the state
 
01:36:24.189 --> 01:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
uh and we wanted and there was a review
 
01:36:25.950 --> 01:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
of the septic system
 
01:36:29.709 --> 01:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
regulations to to see how we could
 
01:36:33.310 --> 01:36:33.320 align:start position:0%
facilitate housing in a responsible way
 
01:36:34.830 --> 01:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
um what the representative has put
 
01:36:39.070 --> 01:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:42.030 --> 01:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
responsible thank you any
 
01:36:45.070 --> 01:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative rang thank you
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair Mr tro thank you for taking my
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
question you talked about the new
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
technologies that require or less land
 
01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
for a leech field so does the department
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
have rules in place to approve those
 
01:36:59.910 --> 01:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
kind of systems in New Hampshire so that
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of communities that may
 
01:37:04.629 --> 01:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
require a lot a minimum lot size to
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
handle a leech field now can maybe
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
adjust their zoning to accommodate the
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
the smaller leech Fields yes thank you
 
01:37:15.709 --> 01:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
for your question um yes the department
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
has rules uh we we essentially approve U
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
certain types of Technologies with
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
different set backs and they have to
 
01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
demonstrate performance to us to say
 
01:37:28.109 --> 01:37:28.119 align:start position:0%
that they can then meet it can be as
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
good or better than our Stone and pipe
 
01:37:33.629 --> 01:37:33.639 align:start position:0%
systems um so those that's a whole other
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
option that that people have and it
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
really depends on the lot um they tend
 
01:37:42.430 --> 01:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
to be a little bit more expensive um and
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh and there's all different types so
 
01:37:44.910 --> 01:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
it's and some of them require
 
01:37:47.229 --> 01:37:47.239 align:start position:0%
maintenance and some of them don't so
 
01:37:49.950 --> 01:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
there there's a there's additional
 
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
factors that need to be considered when
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
using those uh the traditional Stone and
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
pipe systems that we're talking about in
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
this bill you know are for lack of a
 
01:38:01.629 --> 01:38:01.639 align:start position:0%
better word open source you know it's
 
01:38:01.639 --> 01:38:03.189 align:start position:0%
better word open source you know it's
not

01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
proprietary anyone can build them um and
 
01:38:08.910 --> 01:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
uh they're very tried and true
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
technology thank you follow just follow
 
01:38:14.189 --> 01:38:14.199 align:start position:0%
one follow thank you so both both you
 
01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
and uh representative makoni talked
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
about that one of the impetus for this
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
bill is housing and you know this would
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
help encourage more housing make it less
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
expensive but I was wondering what the
 
01:38:28.709 --> 01:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
department thinks about when there are
 
01:38:30.510 --> 01:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
housing developments or we're trying to
 
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
encourage this is to maybe step away
 
01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
from septic like would septic be like
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
the plan a or would it be encouraged to
 
01:38:41.589 --> 01:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
have a sewer system installed to service
 
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
that neighborhood or are there any type
 
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
of community community septic systems um
 
01:38:51.550 --> 01:38:51.560 align:start position:0%
that you know may it it would take away
 
01:38:53.229 --> 01:38:53.239 align:start position:0%
the risk of a homeowner of having a
 
01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
septic system fail because all of their
 
01:38:57.709 --> 01:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
septic is going to a community system is
 
01:38:59.390 --> 01:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
there any movement on the department to
 
01:39:01.390 --> 01:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
look at those
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities an excellent question um I
 
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
would say right now there are there's
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
move there's movement and there all of
 
01:39:11.310 --> 01:39:11.320 align:start position:0%
the options that you mentioned are
 
01:39:13.950 --> 01:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
allowed and discussed with any
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
development uh the um I think among the
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
development Community um water and
 
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
wastewater is starting to become a
 
01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
primary question that they ask when they
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
talk about can we develop in this area
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
and there's an awareness that if you
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
want to do um high density housing you
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
really do need to be on Municipal
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
Services because you um you can't put 50
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
septic systems on a one acre lot you
 
01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:41.320 align:start position:0%
know if you wanted to do a multif family
 
01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
unit multif family development so and
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
and that's really planning that's done
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
at the municipal level and I know
 
01:39:50.109 --> 01:39:50.119 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of work for
 
01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities to to expand their
 
01:39:54.189 --> 01:39:54.199 align:start position:0%
services or understand where there's
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
capacity and where where there isn't uh
 
01:39:59.870 --> 01:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
and to make those Investments um
 
01:40:01.870 --> 01:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
Community Systems is a whole other
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
option and it is considered when you
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
have multi you know multi-unit housing
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
and sometimes that's the best option and
 
01:40:11.669 --> 01:40:11.679 align:start position:0%
if you have a developer that is doing
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
one of those big developments um they're
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
sophisticated and they understand that
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
it may be better to have you know a
 
01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
community system or a few community
 
01:40:23.470 --> 01:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
systems rather than you know a bunch of
 
01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:25.589 align:start position:0%
systems rather than you know a bunch of
individual

01:40:25.589 --> 01:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:40:28.990 --> 01:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
systems representative Darby thank you
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
question um I'm so this you know this
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
seems like an obvious uh benefit um but
 
01:40:41.669 --> 01:40:41.679 align:start position:0%
I wonder um as I this this bill amends
 
01:40:45.390 --> 01:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
485 829 um and as you read through the
 
01:40:47.950 --> 01:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
rest of that um that par that chapter
 
01:40:51.310 --> 01:40:51.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph um there's no other sort of
 
01:40:53.550 --> 01:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
explicit requirements in terms of you
 
01:40:56.109 --> 01:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
know separation it it seems to be in
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
subsection B that it's um proposed by
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
the you know the department they make
 
01:41:03.950 --> 01:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
the standards um and so I'm wondering
 
01:41:06.669 --> 01:41:06.679 align:start position:0%
why there need to be a specific call out
 
01:41:08.910 --> 01:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
here in this one case as opposed to the
 
01:41:10.589 --> 01:41:10.599 align:start position:0%
department making
 
01:41:13.790 --> 01:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
rules uh another excellent question um
 
01:41:16.589 --> 01:41:16.599 align:start position:0%
we do have rules that have lots of other
 
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
requirements for septic systems uh
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
there's setbacks to surface water
 
01:41:23.189 --> 01:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh there's setbacks to very poorly
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
drained soils and wetlands um setbacks
 
01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:28.679 align:start position:0%
to property lines there's rules
 
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
regarding um on-site Wells it's all
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
kinds of things um uh I think the not
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
having been here when 45 was 45a was
 
01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:40.719 align:start position:0%
written I suspect that at the time you
 
01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
know this vertical separation to the
 
01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
groundwater was seen as you know an
 
01:41:47.709 --> 01:41:47.719 align:start position:0%
important setback that needed to be um
 
01:41:51.149 --> 01:41:51.159 align:start position:0%
established in statute um and then would
 
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
leave it up to the department to add in
 
01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:53.950 align:start position:0%
leave it up to the department to add in
these

01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
other um you know separation distances
 
01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:02.149 align:start position:0%
other um you know separation distances
through

01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:05.629 --> 01:42:05.639 align:start position:0%
rule oh what okay but I I didn't
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
understand are you saying that it the 4
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
feet was actually Incorporated P
 
01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
previously in um 45
 
01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
45a um maybe I'm not understanding so
 
01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
you're saying that it was not uh I I
 
01:42:19.629 --> 01:42:19.639 align:start position:0%
didn't see it I don't see any um oh
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
specific separation at all oh I see okay
 
01:42:23.589 --> 01:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
my apologies I don't have it in front of
 
01:42:29.550 --> 01:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
me so I I am uh I am am not sure the I I
 
01:42:32.910 --> 01:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
believe uh the goal here is um this was
 
01:42:34.830 --> 01:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
a came out of a legislative study
 
01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
committee um of a a change that could be

we heard particularly from Mr trobridge
 
03:09:50.670 --> 03:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
at Dees is that uh changing this
 
03:09:53.030 --> 03:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
regulation to only allow 2 feet above
 
03:09:55.550 --> 03:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
the seasonal high water Mark has shown

to be sufficient on replacement so it it
 
03:09:59.710 --> 03:09:59.720 align:start position:0%

for as long as as I've been out 30 30
 
03:15:15.990 --> 03:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
plus years but there's there's been an
 
03:15:19.510 --> 03:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
issue with the process as it is right
 
03:15:22.389 --> 03:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
now uh there have been some
 
03:15:26.590 --> 03:15:26.600 align:start position:0%

and homes and everything are at Peak uh
 
03:15:34.670 --> 03:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
pricing um you were always it was always
 
03:15:36.710 --> 03:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
intended that you were the owner of the
 
03:15:38.550 --> 03:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
home I bought a piece of land I'm the
 
03:15:41.950 --> 03:15:41.960 align:start position:0%
owner of the home I'm I'm a crafty
 
03:15:44.389 --> 03:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
person man or woman I can you know build
 
03:15:46.469 --> 03:15:46.479 align:start position:0%
a building I can do my own Plumbing I
 
03:15:49.030 --> 03:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
can do my electric I sure as heck can do
 
03:15:50.309 --> 03:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
a septic
 
03:15:53.990 --> 03:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
system um but what ended up happening is
 
03:15:56.710 --> 03:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
it happened in my area I'm I'm in the uh
 
03:16:00.229 --> 03:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
Carol County is um some people started
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
saying I'm here's what I'm going to do
 
03:16:03.950 --> 03:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
I'm going to buy a piece of land I'm
 
03:16:05.630 --> 03:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
going to build a house I'm going to tell
 
03:16:07.309 --> 03:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
the building inspector I'm going to tell
 
03:16:10.229 --> 03:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
the state that I'm doing all the work
 
03:16:12.349 --> 03:16:12.359 align:start position:0%
myself and that it's going to be the
 
03:16:14.389 --> 03:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
home that I'm going to move into and I'm
 
03:16:16.469 --> 03:16:16.479 align:start position:0%
going to live in and that's why I should
 
03:16:18.550 --> 03:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
be able to do it but what they're doing
 
03:16:21.469 --> 03:16:21.479 align:start position:0%
is they're skirting the system they'll
 
03:16:23.189 --> 03:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
they'll build the house they'll build
 
03:16:25.710 --> 03:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
their septic system and they'll offer
 
03:16:27.710 --> 03:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
the home for sale immediately and move
 
03:16:30.550 --> 03:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
on to the next the next system so they
 
03:16:33.630 --> 03:16:33.640 align:start position:0%
they might be they might be handy at at
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
framing um and I'd like to say that it's
 
03:16:39.510 --> 03:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
rocket science me myself my family are
 
03:16:41.630 --> 03:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
septic installers I'd like to say it's
 
03:16:44.469 --> 03:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
science but it's not but it it it does
 
03:16:47.070 --> 03:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
involve a high degree of following
 
03:16:49.229 --> 03:16:49.239 align:start position:0%
elevations and slopes and everything
 
03:16:52.269 --> 03:16:52.279 align:start position:0%
else and the department was running this
 
03:16:53.830 --> 03:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
was brought in by the department the
 
03:16:55.670 --> 03:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
department was running into problems
 
03:16:57.110 --> 03:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
that when they send their Regional
 
03:17:00.990 --> 03:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
inspectors out uh one issue is they have
 
03:17:04.510 --> 03:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
no idea how it was supposed to be built
 
03:17:07.070 --> 03:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh they don't know how far a baffle
 
03:17:09.349 --> 03:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
should extend in they've using the wrong
 
03:17:11.670 --> 03:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
pipe they're sloped incorrectly and it's
 
03:17:13.550 --> 03:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
causing the Department to go back three
 
03:17:17.550 --> 03:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
and four times in some cases five times
 
03:17:21.670 --> 03:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh to oversee this and in my area we've
 
03:17:24.550 --> 03:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
had the abuse of developers and I guess
 
03:17:26.830 --> 03:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
my and and I've also developed property
 
03:17:29.790 --> 03:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
so believe me I'm not putting a blanket
 
03:17:32.670 --> 03:17:32.680 align:start position:0%
over developers but uh there are some
 
03:17:35.630 --> 03:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
individuals that would would buy a
 
03:17:38.229 --> 03:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
subdivision and build each house sell
 
03:17:41.269 --> 03:17:41.279 align:start position:0%
that house move to the next one and they
 
03:17:43.870 --> 03:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
were doing this continuously and the
 
03:17:45.710 --> 03:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
department was was knowing that and
 
03:17:49.630 --> 03:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
seeing problems so the reason um that's
 
03:17:51.710 --> 03:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
the emphasis and I will let the
 
03:17:56.030 --> 03:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
department uh speak to to that but in a
 
03:17:58.510 --> 03:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
sense it it's permitting a home owner
 
03:17:59.950 --> 03:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
and they're going to have to sign an
 
03:18:01.870 --> 03:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
affidavit as I understand it that
 
03:18:03.269 --> 03:18:03.279 align:start position:0%
they're going to remain in the home for
 
03:18:06.429 --> 03:18:06.439 align:start position:0%
two years um that they themselves are
 
03:18:07.710 --> 03:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
going to be the
 
03:18:11.550 --> 03:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
person um that is going to make do the
 
03:18:14.070 --> 03:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
install they're not going to hire
 
03:18:17.150 --> 03:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
subcontractors and I believe that uh
 
03:18:17.160 --> 03:18:18.189 align:start position:0%
subcontractors and I believe that uh
most

03:18:18.189 --> 03:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
most
 
03:18:20.590 --> 03:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
importantly uh in item three the
 
03:18:22.830 --> 03:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
property owner will hire permitted
 
03:18:26.630 --> 03:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
septic system designer or permitted
 
03:18:29.710 --> 03:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
installer to certify that the system is
 
03:18:32.910 --> 03:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
built the way it was intended to be so
 
03:18:35.790 --> 03:18:35.800 align:start position:0%
it will it'll be an education for them
 
03:18:38.269 --> 03:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
and then the construction will be
 
03:18:40.550 --> 03:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
overseen uh to make sure that it was
 
03:18:44.070 --> 03:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
built correctly because is when the when
 
03:18:46.469 --> 03:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
the state comes to the
 
03:18:48.790 --> 03:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
inspection they're seeing the top of the
 
03:18:50.910 --> 03:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
field and how does the top of the field
 
03:18:52.790 --> 03:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
and they and they'll see some piping and
 
03:18:55.710 --> 03:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
it's in going in these directions but
 
03:18:58.189 --> 03:18:58.199 align:start position:0%
they don't see what's between the top of
 
03:19:00.950 --> 03:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
the system and down to grade and by
 
03:19:03.070 --> 03:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
allowing some oversight and that's very
 
03:19:04.830 --> 03:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
important if Dirk gets run into the
 
03:19:07.269 --> 03:19:07.279 align:start position:0%
stone or other things it'll shortcircuit
 
03:19:09.830 --> 03:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
the life of the system so uh the
 
03:19:11.389 --> 03:19:11.399 align:start position:0%
department had asked me to bring this
 
03:19:13.630 --> 03:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
forward and I'm happy to answer
 
03:19:15.830 --> 03:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
questions and I know Mr throwbridge is
 
03:19:19.790 --> 03:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
here to explain it in much better
 
03:19:24.269 --> 03:19:24.279 align:start position:0%
detail just a just a question uh on
 
03:19:28.870 --> 03:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
procedure uh you're you're uh you wish
 
03:19:31.790 --> 03:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
to speak to the amendment also or just
 
03:19:34.630 --> 03:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
to the bill itself I apologize Mr
 
03:19:36.550 --> 03:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
chairman I was speaking to the amendment
 
03:19:39.110 --> 03:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
the am okay that's fine that's fine I
 
03:19:42.710 --> 03:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
just the amendment replaces the uh LSR M
 
03:19:46.110 --> 03:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
all right any questions uh by members of
 
03:19:46.120 --> 03:19:47.590 align:start position:0%
all right any questions uh by members of
the

03:19:47.590 --> 03:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:19:50.750 --> 03:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
committee represent representative Bron
 
03:19:51.990 --> 03:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:19:54.670 --> 03:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
03:19:57.229 --> 03:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
if I'm not to understand this right I'll
 
03:19:59.309 --> 03:19:59.319 align:start position:0%
use my own example so let's say my
 
03:20:02.269 --> 03:20:02.279 align:start position:0%
septic system fails and I'm going
 
03:20:04.189 --> 03:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
decideed I'm I need to save some money I
 
03:20:05.349 --> 03:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
want to have it done quickly I'm going
 
03:20:08.710 --> 03:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
to do it myself so if I use the same
 
03:20:11.990 --> 03:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
design of the original septic system I
 
03:20:14.550 --> 03:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
can go and have that work done I just
 
03:20:16.389 --> 03:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
it's just if I have a new design I have
 
03:20:20.510 --> 03:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
to have a uh a certified designer do
 
03:20:23.910 --> 03:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
that so they there're
 
03:20:26.790 --> 03:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
and so that you have you have two
 
03:20:30.389 --> 03:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
methods that you're your use if you are
 
03:20:33.469 --> 03:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
uh as a with a new septic system you as
 
03:20:36.710 --> 03:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
a homeowner under conditions can build
 
03:20:38.590 --> 03:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
can build that septic system with a
 
03:20:42.150 --> 03:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
state approved design or you would would
 
03:20:45.590 --> 03:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
hire a permitted installer to do that
 
03:20:47.910 --> 03:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
your I think your questions further on
 
03:20:50.510 --> 03:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
is that I have a home the septics failed
 
03:20:53.070 --> 03:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
I have a previously approved septic
 
03:20:55.670 --> 03:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
system can I just go ahead and rebuild
 
03:20:58.269 --> 03:20:58.279 align:start position:0%
that and I think that there are
 
03:21:01.070 --> 03:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
conditions on the age and so forth that
 
03:21:03.110 --> 03:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
would permit that but I think that would
 
03:21:05.469 --> 03:21:05.479 align:start position:0%
be better answered by the department
 
03:21:08.510 --> 03:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and then one followup Mr
 
03:21:13.269 --> 03:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
and then so this affidavit um that the
 
03:21:15.309 --> 03:21:15.319 align:start position:0%
they'll live in the domicile for at
 
03:21:18.229 --> 03:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
least two years I don't really
 
03:21:20.990 --> 03:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
understand the relevance of that because
 
03:21:22.670 --> 03:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
we have people that know they have a
 
03:21:24.590 --> 03:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
septic system in failure and they still
 
03:21:29.030 --> 03:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
live in the house so um you know we know
 
03:21:31.510 --> 03:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
just from the some of the testimony
 
03:21:33.910 --> 03:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
we've had around septic systems in the
 
03:21:36.590 --> 03:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
Shoreland area that you know some people
 
03:21:40.189 --> 03:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
do but it doesn't behold someone to have
 
03:21:41.830 --> 03:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
to live in that house I mean I'm Wonder
 
03:21:43.630 --> 03:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
wondering people who maybe have a
 
03:21:45.750 --> 03:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
transfer a work transfer or something
 
03:21:48.070 --> 03:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
and they may have signed this domicile
 
03:21:49.950 --> 03:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
but they I mean this affidavit but then
 
03:21:52.389 --> 03:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
they realize oh my gosh I'm being
 
03:21:54.590 --> 03:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
transferred next you know within that
 
03:21:54.600 --> 03:21:55.790 align:start position:0%
transferred next you know within that
two

03:21:55.790 --> 03:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:21:58.429 --> 03:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
years I'm just wondering what what's the
 
03:22:00.469 --> 03:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
purpose of having that
 
03:22:02.510 --> 03:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
affidavit the
 
03:22:06.550 --> 03:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
it's how much how much teeth is in item
 
03:22:08.990 --> 03:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
number four I can't tell you it's meant
 
03:22:13.550 --> 03:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
to be a deterrent to stop that developer
 
03:22:15.550 --> 03:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
from buying one home building it and
 
03:22:17.590 --> 03:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
moving over to the next one so at least
 
03:22:19.309 --> 03:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
there's a paper trail that the
 
03:22:21.990 --> 03:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
department if they find that this person
 
03:22:25.550 --> 03:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
is is there will always be latitude for
 
03:22:27.269 --> 03:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're saying your work
 
03:22:28.950 --> 03:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
takes you away and you have to sell the
 
03:22:30.830 --> 03:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
home there there's no penalty attached
 
03:22:34.750 --> 03:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
to this my understanding and and um Mr
 
03:22:37.510 --> 03:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
to bridge will address it further it's
 
03:22:42.309 --> 03:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
it's to put that person that flips homes
 
03:22:45.150 --> 03:22:45.160 align:start position:0%
um aware of the fact that they're not to
 
03:22:48.710 --> 03:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:51.590 --> 03:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
that question representative
 
03:22:53.189 --> 03:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative wolf then representative
 
03:22:56.710 --> 03:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
Don thank you Mr chairman um thank you
 
03:22:58.030 --> 03:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
03:23:02.349 --> 03:23:02.359 align:start position:0%
questions um so somebody can come in and
 
03:23:03.710 --> 03:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
put in a new
 
03:23:07.550 --> 03:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
system and tell you that they' complied
 
03:23:10.110 --> 03:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
with all the rules and regulations is
 
03:23:12.110 --> 03:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
there anybody do they have to have an
 
03:23:15.030 --> 03:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
inspection before they cover it
 
03:23:18.950 --> 03:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
over yes representative they do so it's
 
03:23:23.349 --> 03:23:23.359 align:start position:0%
a two-part process um so you the
 
03:23:25.469 --> 03:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
designer comes in or the soil scientist
 
03:23:28.150 --> 03:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
or the engineer comes in and says this
 
03:23:29.950 --> 03:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
is this is what you're going to build
 
03:23:31.710 --> 03:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
and it's state approved and it's been
 
03:23:34.309 --> 03:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
reviewed step number one by the state
 
03:23:38.150 --> 03:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
step number two is that who someone
 
03:23:40.070 --> 03:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's permitted to build that or a
 
03:23:42.229 --> 03:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
homeowner that's following the same
 
03:23:45.110 --> 03:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
regulations then goes out and constructs
 
03:23:47.910 --> 03:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
that system after they've constructed
 
03:23:49.950 --> 03:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
that system before they can get an
 
03:23:52.389 --> 03:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
operational approval which is what the
 
03:23:55.469 --> 03:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
state says in the town I believe before
 
03:23:58.229 --> 03:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
they will grant an OP a um certificate
 
03:24:00.990 --> 03:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
of occupancy the state comes out and
 
03:24:03.030 --> 03:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
inspects the septic system it's a
 
03:24:08.670 --> 03:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:12.269 --> 03:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
question okay so they they can't
 
03:24:16.110 --> 03:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
go forward without the state inspection
 
03:24:19.750 --> 03:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
correct once it's been built once it's
 
03:24:19.760 --> 03:24:23.429 align:start position:0%
correct once it's been built once it's
been

03:24:23.429 --> 03:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:27.630 --> 03:24:27.640 align:start position:0%
built okay I and again as representative
 
03:24:31.030 --> 03:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
run said I don't know why the two-year
 
03:24:32.670 --> 03:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
thing is in there I'd like to see some
 
03:24:34.550 --> 03:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
03:24:38.630 --> 03:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
monetary uh penalty because somebody's
 
03:24:41.229 --> 03:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
going to file an affidavit okay and they
 
03:24:44.590 --> 03:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
don't do anything they they sell it
 
03:24:46.150 --> 03:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
they're long gone they've sold that
 
03:24:48.590 --> 03:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
house they're onward to the next seven
 
03:24:50.070 --> 03:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
houses they build
 
03:24:50.080 --> 03:24:51.590 align:start position:0%
houses they build
them

03:24:51.590 --> 03:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:24:54.189 --> 03:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
that's I understand the point be the
 
03:24:58.189 --> 03:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:01.429 --> 03:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
committee representative ding question
 
03:25:02.990 --> 03:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:25:06.790 --> 03:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
my question um I in here it says a
 
03:25:09.429 --> 03:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
permitted septic system installed uh can
 
03:25:12.469 --> 03:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
you tell me how someone gets a to become
 
03:25:14.630 --> 03:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
a certified septic system installer what
 
03:25:16.309 --> 03:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
is the what is the organization that
 
03:25:18.910 --> 03:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
actually certifies you as a septic
 
03:25:21.309 --> 03:25:21.319 align:start position:0%
system installer and uh what's that
 
03:25:26.389 --> 03:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
process okay so in in our state um the
 
03:25:28.830 --> 03:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
03:25:32.750 --> 03:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
subsurface overseas permitting of
 
03:25:34.950 --> 03:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
persons with qualifications to be
 
03:25:38.790 --> 03:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
designers or installers or
 
03:25:42.510 --> 03:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
both the state also has a license
 
03:25:44.590 --> 03:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
procedure not to muddle it so people
 
03:25:47.269 --> 03:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
that inspect septic systems that's a
 
03:25:50.710 --> 03:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
license but the permitting for designers
 
03:25:53.790 --> 03:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
and installers is done by the department
 
03:25:55.469 --> 03:25:55.479 align:start position:0%
um the requirement it's going to be
 
03:25:58.710 --> 03:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
discussed later in another hearing here
 
03:26:01.150 --> 03:26:01.160 align:start position:0%
is that they are to take a test a
 
03:26:03.710 --> 03:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
written test that's offered I believe
 
03:26:07.229 --> 03:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
once or twice a year um and have to have
 
03:26:07.239 --> 03:26:09.110 align:start position:0%
once or twice a year um and have to have
some

03:26:09.110 --> 03:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:26:12.469 --> 03:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
um uh credentials as having been in the
 
03:26:14.590 --> 03:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
business and passed the test and they
 
03:26:19.790 --> 03:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:22.790 --> 03:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
permit sentive harp for a question thank
 
03:26:24.790 --> 03:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
you represent thank you representative
 
03:26:26.309 --> 03:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
03:26:29.590 --> 03:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
question um it looks like in number
 
03:26:31.710 --> 03:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
three you're
 
03:26:35.110 --> 03:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
really suggesting that I get an ASB
 
03:26:38.150 --> 03:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
built plan even though you say a letter
 
03:26:42.510 --> 03:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be similar to a as built
 
03:26:44.510 --> 03:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
plan because you have the septic
 
03:26:46.590 --> 03:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
approved plan but then when you're
 
03:26:48.630 --> 03:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
normally done would you not get an as
 
03:26:51.070 --> 03:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
built plan this just says you're going
 
03:26:54.830 --> 03:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
to get a letter or certification but
 
03:26:56.950 --> 03:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you be just
 
03:27:01.469 --> 03:27:01.479 align:start position:0%
like the dees I'm doing my work I finish
 
03:27:03.990 --> 03:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
it if I don't have you overseeing every
 
03:27:05.830 --> 03:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
letter you don't know how much sand I
 
03:27:07.150 --> 03:27:07.160 align:start position:0%
have you don't know where I put the
 
03:27:10.389 --> 03:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
pipes so I'm not against the idea
 
03:27:11.950 --> 03:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
somebody should look at it but it's
 
03:27:15.510 --> 03:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
almost as if how you going to really do
 
03:27:17.830 --> 03:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
that and is it going to lead to an as
 
03:27:20.150 --> 03:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
built plan
 
03:27:23.750 --> 03:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
situation the presently in regulations
 
03:27:26.750 --> 03:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
when you're doing an install if
 
03:27:28.990 --> 03:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
everything everything on a house site
 
03:27:32.110 --> 03:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
can move a house can move the septic
 
03:27:34.990 --> 03:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
tank can move the piping can move the
 
03:27:36.950 --> 03:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
only thing that has to stay in that
 
03:27:40.030 --> 03:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
place is the septic field itself it has
 
03:27:41.870 --> 03:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
to remain there
 
03:27:45.469 --> 03:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
the word as built typically comes in uh
 
03:27:47.710 --> 03:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
when the septic tank got moved the house
 
03:27:51.710 --> 03:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
got moved or piping got moved and the
 
03:27:54.830 --> 03:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
installer Andor homeowner in limited
 
03:27:57.910 --> 03:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
instances where homeowner can do that is
 
03:28:01.030 --> 03:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
obligated by the department to have that
 
03:28:04.429 --> 03:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
amended plan available so all those
 
03:28:06.870 --> 03:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
changes so when the inspector comes he
 
03:28:09.910 --> 03:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
sees or she sees what is there what
 
03:28:12.510 --> 03:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
happened years ago the Department wasn't
 
03:28:16.269 --> 03:28:16.279 align:start position:0%
requiring it today it's an assurance to
 
03:28:18.429 --> 03:28:18.439 align:start position:0%
you as the new homeowner that that's
 
03:28:22.030 --> 03:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
where things are but if nothing changed
 
03:28:24.309 --> 03:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
and everything stayed where it was you
 
03:28:26.429 --> 03:28:26.439 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily need that amended
 
03:28:29.150 --> 03:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
plan I don't know if that helps you sir
 
03:28:31.990 --> 03:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
or want to rephrase
 
03:28:34.510 --> 03:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
it might I or a
 
03:28:38.030 --> 03:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
followup I'll try to rephrase it how are
 
03:28:40.189 --> 03:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
you going to be able to certify as the
 
03:28:42.550 --> 03:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
installer that it was done properly if
 
03:28:44.309 --> 03:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
you weren't like a clerk of the works
 
03:28:46.429 --> 03:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
watching them do
 
03:28:46.439 --> 03:28:48.990 align:start position:0%
watching them do
it

03:28:48.990 --> 03:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:28:51.870 --> 03:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
okay the depart the department has been
 
03:28:54.750 --> 03:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
wrestling with this issue for a long
 
03:28:57.750 --> 03:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
time with the homeowner install and it's
 
03:29:00.309 --> 03:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
been interpreted differently by the
 
03:29:03.750 --> 03:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
department on what they can do and can't
 
03:29:08.670 --> 03:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
do and the current
 
03:29:12.150 --> 03:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
interpretation um
 
03:29:15.830 --> 03:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
a homeowner a homeowner presently can't
 
03:29:18.070 --> 03:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
so a homeowner's built their septic
 
03:29:20.670 --> 03:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
system and they're ready for they're
 
03:29:23.830 --> 03:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
ready for it to be inspected there's not
 
03:29:26.750 --> 03:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
a mechanism out there right now for the
 
03:29:30.710 --> 03:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
home owner to enter the system digitally
 
03:29:33.750 --> 03:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
and say it's time for inspection so the
 
03:29:36.510 --> 03:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
homeowners had to be going through an
 
03:29:38.870 --> 03:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
installer to get that
 
03:29:43.950 --> 03:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
done and if this has happened in my
 
03:29:47.469 --> 03:29:47.479 align:start position:0%
area and it has
 
03:29:51.189 --> 03:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
then as we get involved as the installer
 
03:29:54.309 --> 03:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
I won't certify I won't call in that
 
03:29:57.229 --> 03:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
plan unless I've seen four or five steps
 
03:29:58.950 --> 03:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
happen because I don't want my name
 
03:30:01.269 --> 03:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
associated with it I I think they're
 
03:30:03.309 --> 03:30:03.319 align:start position:0%
trying they're trying to work out this
 
03:30:07.389 --> 03:30:07.399 align:start position:0%
issue but um if in the future if this
 
03:30:09.870 --> 03:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
were to pass I can assure you if someone
 
03:30:12.030 --> 03:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
came to our company our family business
 
03:30:14.790 --> 03:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
to do this we are going to want to see
 
03:30:16.950 --> 03:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
the soil before it was you know that it
 
03:30:19.389 --> 03:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
was cleared materials were correct and
 
03:30:19.399 --> 03:30:21.150 align:start position:0%
was cleared materials were correct and
everything

03:30:21.150 --> 03:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
everything
 
03:30:24.469 --> 03:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
else so you would look at it can I have
 
03:30:24.479 --> 03:30:26.389 align:start position:0%
else so you would look at it can I have
one

03:30:26.389 --> 03:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:30:29.950 --> 03:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
followup I I'm represent Builders but I
 
03:30:33.990 --> 03:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
don't do septic systems so I I'm sort of
 
03:30:36.150 --> 03:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
trying to follow the idea and it was
 
03:30:38.469 --> 03:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the homeowner can have
 
03:30:42.469 --> 03:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
the system done unless he Subs it out to
 
03:30:45.950 --> 03:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
somebody but I'm a homeowner I'm going
 
03:30:47.510 --> 03:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
to sub out the guy that's going to bring
 
03:30:49.269 --> 03:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
the sand I'm going to sub out the guy
 
03:30:51.030 --> 03:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to bring the pipes I'm I'm
 
03:30:53.070 --> 03:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
not bringing all that somebody's going
 
03:30:54.790 --> 03:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
to install the sand they're going to
 
03:30:57.429 --> 03:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
excavate they're going to so I'm the GC
 
03:30:58.750 --> 03:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
the general
 
03:31:01.189 --> 03:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
contractor but I'm not doing the work
 
03:31:04.110 --> 03:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
I'm just the GC so I don't know how this
 
03:31:07.950 --> 03:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
fits into the homeowner does it okay so
 
03:31:10.110 --> 03:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and you bring
 
03:31:12.590 --> 03:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
up several GR points and if you took the
 
03:31:14.750 --> 03:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
little interpretation it would say that
 
03:31:16.429 --> 03:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
I had to go get the pipe and I had do
 
03:31:20.590 --> 03:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
everything else um and for a septic
 
03:31:22.269 --> 03:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
installer doing this work himself he
 
03:31:24.830 --> 03:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
does exactly what you just mentioned we
 
03:31:26.710 --> 03:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
call have tanks delivered and all that
 
03:31:29.189 --> 03:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
sort of thing what they're trying what
 
03:31:32.150 --> 03:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
the the intent is when it comes time to
 
03:31:34.510 --> 03:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
put that pipe in the ground in the stone
 
03:31:36.630 --> 03:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
or plastic tubes or whatever it is
 
03:31:38.870 --> 03:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
they're using the intent is that the
 
03:31:42.550 --> 03:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
homeowner is actually doing that work oh
 
03:31:45.189 --> 03:31:45.199 align:start position:0%

have a permitted installer to do it and
 
03:31:49.790 --> 03:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
that's what these developers are doing

we have now Dees does a wonderful
 
03:32:55.309 --> 03:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
job inspecting systems along the process
 
03:32:58.309 --> 03:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
certainly and I think that was maybe
 
03:33:01.510 --> 03:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
looking at more problems than solving
 
03:33:01.520 --> 03:33:02.790 align:start position:0%
looking at more problems than solving
thank

03:33:02.790 --> 03:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:33:09.750 --> 03:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:14.229 --> 03:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative we septic system that
 
03:33:28.910 --> 03:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:28.920 --> 03:33:32.429 align:start position:0%
 
tank

03:33:32.429 --> 03:33:32.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:32.439 --> 03:33:39.550 align:start position:0%
 
problem

03:33:39.550 --> 03:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:42.630 --> 03:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
system thank thank you for the question
 
03:33:46.590 --> 03:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
so when we speak of a septic system most
 
03:33:48.870 --> 03:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
most of the regulation is about the
 
03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
leech field itself in the tank that it's
 
03:33:56.710 --> 03:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
connected to um the plan says how those
 
03:33:58.510 --> 03:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
things are going there how the tanks
 
03:34:01.349 --> 03:34:01.359 align:start position:0%
constructed in the piping you are not
 
03:34:06.070 --> 03:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
permitted to make a repair to a septic
 
03:34:09.389 --> 03:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
field without a plan in hand uh there
 
03:34:11.630 --> 03:34:11.640 align:start position:0%
are some instances is a homeowner if you
 
03:34:13.469 --> 03:34:13.479 align:start position:0%
have a pipe that's broken from the house
 
03:34:17.229 --> 03:34:17.239 align:start position:0%
to the to the tank you can do that if
 
03:34:20.630 --> 03:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
you have my understanding is a septic
 
03:34:24.750 --> 03:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
tank um that is there's there's baffles
 
03:34:27.830 --> 03:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
in there the baffles are uh waste comes
 
03:34:31.510 --> 03:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
into the tank and it drops it down into
 
03:34:34.710 --> 03:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
the uh the tank as opposed to letting it
 
03:34:36.990 --> 03:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
float and the same thing when it goes
 
03:34:38.630 --> 03:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
out there's a baffle so you're drawing
 
03:34:40.309 --> 03:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
from what they call called the clear
 
03:34:43.349 --> 03:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
Zone if those baffles were to break or
 
03:34:46.150 --> 03:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
to fail you could do that work and not
 
03:34:49.510 --> 03:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
need a permit to do that but they when
 
03:34:54.510 --> 03:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
the state comes to to inspect the final
 
03:34:57.269 --> 03:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
product they look at the septic field
 
03:34:59.950 --> 03:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
the septic tank and all the
 
03:35:02.990 --> 03:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
piping within four feet of the building
 
03:35:05.030 --> 03:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
they they can't go into the building and
 
03:35:07.110 --> 03:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
an installer cannot make Plumbing
 
03:35:09.750 --> 03:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
changes inside a building I don't know
 
03:35:15.429 --> 03:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:17.950 --> 03:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey bu thank you very
 
03:35:20.550 --> 03:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
much real quick question um thank you
 
03:35:24.189 --> 03:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
for that uh clarification now yes uh
 
03:35:28.150 --> 03:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
homeowner can't replace the septic field
 
03:35:30.710 --> 03:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
can they replace just the sand or can
 
03:35:34.469 --> 03:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
they add sand no no okay that also
 
03:35:39.309 --> 03:35:39.319 align:start position:0%
requires a designer installer okay thank
 
03:35:43.269 --> 03:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
you oops sentive from thank you Mr chair
 
03:35:47.229 --> 03:35:47.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so the
 
03:35:49.150 --> 03:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
um powers that we're giving the
 
03:35:51.189 --> 03:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
homeowners to do this work that's under
 
03:35:51.199 --> 03:35:52.469 align:start position:0%
homeowners to do this work that's under
this

03:35:52.469 --> 03:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:35:54.750 --> 03:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
amendment just in your professional
 
03:35:56.790 --> 03:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
opinion um representative makoni how
 
03:35:59.269 --> 03:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
many of them do you think would could do
 
03:36:02.349 --> 03:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
an adequate job with just the average
 
03:36:04.550 --> 03:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
homeowner because it seems I'm I'm just
 
03:36:06.429 --> 03:36:06.439 align:start position:0%
getting the sense that for a homeowner
 
03:36:08.429 --> 03:36:08.439 align:start position:0%
to be able to take advantage of this
 
03:36:09.550 --> 03:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
they would have to have a lot of
 
03:36:11.269 --> 03:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
specialized skills
 
03:36:13.590 --> 03:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
that we now put on to septic system
 
03:36:15.110 --> 03:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
installers how many people could
 
03:36:18.269 --> 03:36:18.279 align:start position:0%
actually do that work themselves okay as
 
03:36:21.349 --> 03:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
I mentioned I'm I'm a family business I
 
03:36:24.950 --> 03:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
my sons are all designers and myself and
 
03:36:26.990 --> 03:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
and we will
 
03:36:30.070 --> 03:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
process out of out of let's say the last
 
03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
100 septic designs we've we've submitted
 
03:36:37.110 --> 03:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
I have probably had eight people that
 
03:36:39.189 --> 03:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
were trades people that could very
 
03:36:41.870 --> 03:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
easily do it themselves
 
03:36:43.870 --> 03:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
it's not a it's not a really large
 
03:36:46.269 --> 03:36:46.279 align:start position:0%
percentage but they sit there scratching
 
03:36:48.550 --> 03:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
their head that I've moved made a
 
03:36:51.070 --> 03:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
conscious move to come to New Hampshire
 
03:36:52.670 --> 03:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
the live fre or die State and you're
 
03:36:54.670 --> 03:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
telling me I can't build a septic system
 
03:36:56.870 --> 03:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
and you know I own trucks and I know how
 
03:36:58.990 --> 03:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
to use a laser level and so forth It's
 
03:37:02.790 --> 03:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
not a huge percentage but it's um it's
 
03:37:04.750 --> 03:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
warranted they've always had the ability
 
03:37:07.189 --> 03:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
I I believe it's just tightening up the
 
03:37:09.389 --> 03:37:09.399 align:start position:0%
rains a
 
03:37:09.399 --> 03:37:11.590 align:start position:0%
rains a
little

03:37:11.590 --> 03:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
little
 
03:37:15.389 --> 03:37:15.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:19.349 --> 03:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
else seeing no one thank you very much
 
03:37:33.590 --> 03:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:36.590 --> 03:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
good morning good afternoon Mr chairman
 
03:37:39.910 --> 03:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee um for the
 
03:37:41.550 --> 03:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
record my my name is Philip Trowbridge
 
03:37:43.229 --> 03:37:43.239 align:start position:0%
I'm the manager of the land resources
 
03:37:45.830 --> 03:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
management program at New Hampshire
 
03:37:49.389 --> 03:37:49.399 align:start position:0%
Dees um so uh representative Muni has
 
03:37:50.630 --> 03:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
done an excellent job of I think
 
03:37:52.030 --> 03:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
describing a lot of the background
 
03:37:55.750 --> 03:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
associated with this bill so I'm um not
 
03:37:59.150 --> 03:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
going to cover that material um what I
 
03:38:00.349 --> 03:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
want to say clearly is that the
 
03:38:02.110 --> 03:38:02.120 align:start position:0%
department supports this
 
03:38:05.389 --> 03:38:05.399 align:start position:0%
bill um and that we feel that this is an
 
03:38:07.110 --> 03:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
improvement over the current
 
03:38:10.830 --> 03:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
situation uh the current statute allows
 
03:38:12.349 --> 03:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
for these homeowner
 
03:38:14.590 --> 03:38:14.600 align:start position:0%
installations um without any of the
 
03:38:16.189 --> 03:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
safeguards that we'd be adding through
 
03:38:19.870 --> 03:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment the uh the oversight by a
 
03:38:23.670 --> 03:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
permanent installer the certification by
 
03:38:25.590 --> 03:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
through an affidavit that this house is
 
03:38:28.830 --> 03:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
not going to be flipped um for
 
03:38:32.030 --> 03:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
development um and that those are the
 
03:38:33.150 --> 03:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
things that we've had the biggest
 
03:38:34.710 --> 03:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
challenge with over
 
03:38:37.750 --> 03:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
time um representative harb you asked
 
03:38:39.910 --> 03:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
about you know as builts and how this is
 
03:38:39.920 --> 03:38:40.830 align:start position:0%
about you know as builts and how this is
different

03:38:40.830 --> 03:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:38:42.110 --> 03:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things I wanted to point
 
03:38:45.830 --> 03:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
out is that um the area below the septic
 
03:38:48.110 --> 03:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
system the base the base of it below the
 
03:38:50.870 --> 03:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
Lee field uh needs to be what's called
 
03:38:53.670 --> 03:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
scarified so they'll excavate down to
 
03:38:55.870 --> 03:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
where the base of the leech field should
 
03:38:58.070 --> 03:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
be but then there also should use
 
03:39:00.429 --> 03:39:00.439 align:start position:0%
equipment to to loosen up the
 
03:39:03.590 --> 03:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
soil uh and to prepare that bed bottom
 
03:39:05.550 --> 03:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
for the leech field it's something that
 
03:39:07.910 --> 03:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
we cannot observe as the state when we
 
03:39:11.150 --> 03:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
come in later and and we're just um
 
03:39:13.550 --> 03:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
looking at really the top of the system
 
03:39:16.030 --> 03:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
and that's if you notice in the
 
03:39:18.550 --> 03:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
amendment on
 
03:39:21.990 --> 03:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
line um
 
03:39:27.070 --> 03:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
15 we called out specifically um the
 
03:39:28.950 --> 03:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to the base of
 
03:39:31.510 --> 03:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
the affluent disposal area as one of the
 
03:39:33.910 --> 03:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
things that we feel very strongly that
 
03:39:35.590 --> 03:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
the you know this installer who was
 
03:39:37.910 --> 03:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
overse seeeing the project would would
 
03:39:39.870 --> 03:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
look at because that's really kind of
 
03:39:42.389 --> 03:39:42.399 align:start position:0%
where a lot of these systems succeed or
 
03:39:44.910 --> 03:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
fail and and so it's a little you know
 
03:39:47.269 --> 03:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
the the as built might look the same as
 
03:39:49.189 --> 03:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
you know the leechfield is at this
 
03:39:51.670 --> 03:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
elevation it's in this area but that
 
03:39:55.110 --> 03:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
preparation of the basil area um is
 
03:39:56.429 --> 03:39:56.439 align:start position:0%
something that have to be observed at
 
03:39:58.870 --> 03:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
that time and representative Maki
 
03:40:00.469 --> 03:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
alluded to that of saying there's a few
 
03:40:03.269 --> 03:40:03.279 align:start position:0%
things that he'd want to be seeing uh to
 
03:40:05.990 --> 03:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
certify to make that
 
03:40:09.150 --> 03:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
certification um we also added a
 
03:40:11.710 --> 03:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
safeguard to say that the property owner
 
03:40:13.710 --> 03:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
or a permited septic system installer
 
03:40:16.510 --> 03:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
perform all the work to construct with
 
03:40:19.070 --> 03:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
the Waste Disposal system that's at line
 
03:40:21.910 --> 03:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
12 um this is getting to the point of
 
03:40:25.469 --> 03:40:25.479 align:start position:0%
the intent here is that we're not hiring
 
03:40:29.790 --> 03:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
subcontractors we're not hiring the uh
 
03:40:32.349 --> 03:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
landscapers to do the work and so it's
 
03:40:33.790 --> 03:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
it's kind of it's saying there are those
 
03:40:35.309 --> 03:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
people who have these skills they have
 
03:40:37.830 --> 03:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
the equipment and um you know the
 
03:40:39.950 --> 03:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
legislature had established this you
 
03:40:41.630 --> 03:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
know Authority for them to do this for
 
03:40:43.710 --> 03:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
their own domicile uh but we're trying
 
03:40:45.830 --> 03:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
to distinguish the people who really can
 
03:40:49.710 --> 03:40:49.720 align:start position:0%
do that for their own domile from people
 
03:40:51.910 --> 03:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
who are just uh trying to do uh trying
 
03:40:55.750 --> 03:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
to avoid the cost of hiring a permanent
 
03:40:59.150 --> 03:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
installer uh so I I think you know some
 
03:41:00.990 --> 03:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
of the conversation here today has been
 
03:41:03.150 --> 03:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
about you know we're adding uh or
 
03:41:06.229 --> 03:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
granting authorities um to to homeowners
 
03:41:09.189 --> 03:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
that they didn't have and um yeah we're
 
03:41:11.670 --> 03:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
actually constraining those authorities
 
03:41:14.990 --> 03:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
um and uh we recognize uh and the reason
 
03:41:16.269 --> 03:41:16.279 align:start position:0%
why there there's an amendment here
 
03:41:19.030 --> 03:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
today is um you know there was we
 
03:41:20.510 --> 03:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
received some comment of people saying
 
03:41:22.429 --> 03:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
there are legitimate cases where someone
 
03:41:23.950 --> 03:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
want you know he's building the house
 
03:41:26.469 --> 03:41:26.479 align:start position:0%
from the floor up they're pouring the
 
03:41:28.070 --> 03:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
foundation they're doing the plumbing
 
03:41:29.870 --> 03:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
they're doing the electrical work
 
03:41:32.710 --> 03:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
and why can't they do the sepic system
 
03:41:36.189 --> 03:41:36.199 align:start position:0%
too and so we wanted to add that with
 
03:41:39.389 --> 03:41:39.399 align:start position:0%
these safeguards so that you know that
 
03:41:42.950 --> 03:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know that right is um you know is
 
03:41:46.790 --> 03:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
available to the the people where it's
 
03:41:46.800 --> 03:41:48.469 align:start position:0%
available to the the people where it's
appropriate

03:41:48.469 --> 03:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
03:41:52.469 --> 03:41:52.479 align:start position:0%
um so uh I think I was
 
03:41:55.110 --> 03:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
um representative wolf you asked
 
03:41:57.110 --> 03:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
represent wolf is not here sorry
 
03:41:58.750 --> 03:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
representative wolf asked asked about
 
03:42:02.830 --> 03:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
monetary penalties and if there you know
 
03:42:06.149 --> 03:42:06.159 align:start position:0%
the section of the RSA that we refer to
 
03:42:11.269 --> 03:42:11.279 align:start position:0%
um for penalties 45 a43 which is
 
03:42:14.269 --> 03:42:14.279 align:start position:0%
on line 21 that's the section of RSA
 
03:42:16.990 --> 03:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
that deals with fines and other
 
03:42:19.429 --> 03:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
penalties so you know what we would
 
03:42:22.349 --> 03:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
Envision is you know if there was an
 
03:42:24.870 --> 03:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
egregious violation uh that we could
 
03:42:26.389 --> 03:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
find an
 
03:42:30.590 --> 03:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
individual uh for um violating this
 
03:42:33.950 --> 03:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:33.960 --> 03:42:37.309 align:start position:0%
 
statute

03:42:37.309 --> 03:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:40.110 --> 03:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
um I believe those were most of the the
 
03:42:42.229 --> 03:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
questions that were asked and I'd be
 
03:42:44.910 --> 03:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
happy to take any further questions
 
03:42:46.750 --> 03:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
representative Donley for
 
03:42:50.070 --> 03:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you Mr chair um
 
03:42:53.229 --> 03:42:53.239 align:start position:0%
how many permitted installers does New
 
03:42:56.189 --> 03:42:56.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have across the state um thank
 
03:42:58.070 --> 03:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
you for the question we have rough a
 
03:43:05.870 --> 03:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:09.550 --> 03:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
2,000 any other questions members of the
 
03:43:11.070 --> 03:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
the commit
 
03:43:13.510 --> 03:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative run for a question thank
 
03:43:15.189 --> 03:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Mr trobridge
 
03:43:17.550 --> 03:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question when a setic
 
03:43:20.070 --> 03:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
system is replaced or a new septic
 
03:43:22.750 --> 03:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
system installed is it only Dees that
 
03:43:24.910 --> 03:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
inspects that is there a requirement by
 
03:43:28.229 --> 03:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
local town code officer to do an
 
03:43:30.590 --> 03:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
inspection excellent question uh it
 
03:43:32.870 --> 03:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
depends on the town some if a town has a
 
03:43:34.950 --> 03:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
local ordinance that requires a town
 
03:43:37.229 --> 03:43:37.239 align:start position:0%
inspection then yes and that is all done
 
03:43:40.710 --> 03:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
before the state process um you know
 
03:43:44.309 --> 03:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
before the state inspection U but if um
 
03:43:45.870 --> 03:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
that all depends on the town and if they
 
03:43:49.550 --> 03:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:53.189 --> 03:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
ordinance so hypothetical let's say if a
 
03:43:56.269 --> 03:43:56.279 align:start position:0%
town all towns have an ordinance that a
 
03:43:58.229 --> 03:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
septic system either a new a replacement
 
03:44:01.710 --> 03:44:01.720 align:start position:0%
has to be inspected by the the town code
 
03:44:04.990 --> 03:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
officer would that alleviate a lot of
 
03:44:08.030 --> 03:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
some issues that may be presented with
 
03:44:10.870 --> 03:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
this bill so if you have an owner doing
 
03:44:14.189 --> 03:44:14.199 align:start position:0%
their own work you know the the town
 
03:44:15.990 --> 03:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
could be enabled to adopt these
 
03:44:18.910 --> 03:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
ordinances that would provide that
 
03:44:21.830 --> 03:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
ongoing inspection and I mentioned this
 
03:44:24.189 --> 03:44:24.199 align:start position:0%
I've had two septic systems replaced
 
03:44:27.590 --> 03:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
over 40 years different properties but
 
03:44:29.110 --> 03:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
um there was somebody from the town that
 
03:44:31.510 --> 03:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
came out and looked a few times they
 
03:44:34.469 --> 03:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
they came out to confirm the seasonal
 
03:44:36.630 --> 03:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
high water mark they came to look at
 
03:44:40.070 --> 03:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
everything before it was closed up so so
 
03:44:42.070 --> 03:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
I I guess I just assume that was going
 
03:44:44.790 --> 03:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
on if throughout the
 
03:44:49.149 --> 03:44:49.159 align:start position:0%
state very good question um the there
 
03:44:52.030 --> 03:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
are relatively few towns that have these
 
03:44:54.630 --> 03:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
ordinances um I I'm going I don't know
 
03:44:56.110 --> 03:44:56.120 align:start position:0%
the exact number but it's say it's
 
03:44:57.550 --> 03:44:57.560 align:start position:0%
between 30 and
 
03:45:00.710 --> 03:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
50 um and so it is the minority of the
 
03:45:02.670 --> 03:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
towns that have ordinances and code
 
03:45:05.429 --> 03:45:05.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers who are able to do
 
03:45:07.429 --> 03:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
those inspections and then of course it
 
03:45:09.110 --> 03:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
depends what the ordinance says and if
 
03:45:12.790 --> 03:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
the ordinance is about um set you know
 
03:45:13.830 --> 03:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
there's something they're primarily
 
03:45:16.189 --> 03:45:16.199 align:start position:0%
looking at setbacks or they're P only
 
03:45:17.790 --> 03:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
going to visit the site you know when
 
03:45:19.429 --> 03:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
it's ready to be backfilled like right
 
03:45:23.389 --> 03:45:23.399 align:start position:0%
before the state um versus in this case
 
03:45:24.910 --> 03:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
where we want to call out that someone
 
03:45:26.030 --> 03:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
should look at
 
03:45:30.030 --> 03:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
it um you know after the initial
 
03:45:32.189 --> 03:45:32.199 align:start position:0%
excavation to see if the basil area has
 
03:45:35.070 --> 03:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
been properly prepared um so I we think
 
03:45:38.070 --> 03:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
that this is setting the kind of the the
 
03:45:40.990 --> 03:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
minimum standard that that should be
 
03:45:42.590 --> 03:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
established should be held throughout
 
03:45:45.149 --> 03:45:45.159 align:start position:0%
the state and obviously towns are have
 
03:45:47.630 --> 03:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
the right to provide or to create more
 
03:45:47.640 --> 03:45:50.750 align:start position:0%
the right to provide or to create more
strict

03:45:50.750 --> 03:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:53.229 --> 03:45:53.239 align:start position:0%
ordinance representative G and
 
03:45:55.429 --> 03:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
representative D does this does these
 
03:45:57.269 --> 03:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
inspections hold up people getting
 
03:45:57.279 --> 03:45:58.550 align:start position:0%
inspections hold up people getting
things

03:45:58.550 --> 03:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:46:02.550 --> 03:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
done um excellent question um I'd say
 
03:46:05.189 --> 03:46:05.199 align:start position:0%
from our state inspections uh I'm very
 
03:46:06.990 --> 03:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
proud of our team we do our inspections
 
03:46:08.710 --> 03:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
within one to two days which is really
 
03:46:10.149 --> 03:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
pretty remarkable
 
03:46:11.750 --> 03:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh we have a great team that covers the
 
03:46:14.790 --> 03:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
whole state so we are are not holding
 
03:46:18.510 --> 03:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
things up um and I'd say in the instance
 
03:46:20.550 --> 03:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
here where you'd be working with an
 
03:46:23.630 --> 03:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
installer um you know I I would you
 
03:46:24.870 --> 03:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
would have a that would be under
 
03:46:27.550 --> 03:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
contract between the the owner and the
 
03:46:30.110 --> 03:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
installer for the work and it's for
 
03:46:33.309 --> 03:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
compensation so I would expect the you
 
03:46:36.110 --> 03:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
know the um the oversight to be done in
 
03:46:38.590 --> 03:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
a timely
 
03:46:41.189 --> 03:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
way okay representative Donnelly then
 
03:46:44.030 --> 03:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative hary thank you Mr chair
 
03:46:47.030 --> 03:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um what's the additional cost
 
03:46:50.870 --> 03:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
on average for having a an installer
 
03:46:53.910 --> 03:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
versus saying someone who does it
 
03:46:56.349 --> 03:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
themselves excellent question we we've
 
03:46:58.790 --> 03:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
been kind of trying to Ballpark that and
 
03:47:01.630 --> 03:47:01.640 align:start position:0%
um our estimate on this is is if someone
 
03:47:03.309 --> 03:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
were really doing this entirely
 
03:47:05.269 --> 03:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
themselves they have their own equipment
 
03:47:06.309 --> 03:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to hire an
 
03:47:08.030 --> 03:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
installer to provide oversight they're
 
03:47:09.870 --> 03:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
going to have to buy a you know
 
03:47:12.309 --> 03:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
materials um we think it probably cuts
 
03:47:15.030 --> 03:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
the cost of a septic system in
 
03:47:17.429 --> 03:47:17.439 align:start position:0%
half um you know and right now just for
 
03:47:19.790 --> 03:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
reference you know septic systems cost
 
03:47:28.590 --> 03:47:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:32.630 --> 03:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
$35,000 thank you is great uh testimony
 
03:47:35.030 --> 03:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
and about how many um representative
 
03:47:38.189 --> 03:47:38.199 align:start position:0%
makoni was talking about the house the
 
03:47:40.670 --> 03:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
individual say uh developer or whatnot
 
03:47:42.309 --> 03:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
is doing the house flipping and then
 
03:47:45.309 --> 03:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
moving on and you're discovering these
 
03:47:48.229 --> 03:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
bad systems say how often did that
 
03:47:51.389 --> 03:47:51.399 align:start position:0%
happen last year in and years prior if
 
03:47:53.710 --> 03:47:53.720 align:start position:0%
you have that number thank
 
03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
you yeah you guys are asking all the
 
03:47:57.630 --> 03:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
hard questions
 
03:47:59.790 --> 03:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
sorry we've been trying to tease that
 
03:48:02.269 --> 03:48:02.279 align:start position:0%
out and we have we do keep records of of
 
03:48:05.990 --> 03:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
this and there's an we try and separate
 
03:48:08.030 --> 03:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
things that are like new construction
 
03:48:10.110 --> 03:48:10.120 align:start position:0%
versus like a repair
 
03:48:12.630 --> 03:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
um sometimes the you know our our our
 
03:48:14.189 --> 03:48:14.199 align:start position:0%
database does not distinguish like
 
03:48:16.189 --> 03:48:16.199 align:start position:0%
replacement from new construction so we
 
03:48:19.550 --> 03:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to tease it all out um
 
03:48:22.070 --> 03:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
I'd say in the not in the last year but
 
03:48:23.790 --> 03:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
in you know several years ago when this
 
03:48:26.030 --> 03:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
was really um a more active thing we
 
03:48:28.710 --> 03:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
were getting on the order of let's just
 
03:48:31.389 --> 03:48:31.399 align:start position:0%
say we were getting like about 150
 
03:48:31.399 --> 03:48:32.590 align:start position:0%
say we were getting like about 150
homeowner

03:48:32.590 --> 03:48:32.600 align:start position:0%
homeowner
 
03:48:34.870 --> 03:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
installations each year that we were
 
03:48:38.469 --> 03:48:38.479 align:start position:0%
dealing with we subsequently had a legal
 
03:48:42.389 --> 03:48:42.399 align:start position:0%
interpretation of domicile which said
 
03:48:44.469 --> 03:48:44.479 align:start position:0%
domicile has to be a place where you're
 
03:48:47.990 --> 03:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
actively living so how can it be new
 
03:48:52.710 --> 03:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
construction and so we were um you
 
03:48:55.630 --> 03:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
know uh getting the word out that that's
 
03:48:57.229 --> 03:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
not how this should be used and the
 
03:48:58.790 --> 03:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
numbers did come down but there were
 
03:49:01.030 --> 03:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
still a whole number that came in
 
03:49:03.469 --> 03:49:03.479 align:start position:0%
because people would you know go ahead
 
03:49:05.309 --> 03:49:05.319 align:start position:0%
with their work and then call to us and
 
03:49:07.710 --> 03:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
say I've already put it all in you know
 
03:49:10.990 --> 03:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
I'm you know I've invested $20,000 you
 
03:49:12.030 --> 03:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
know you need
 
03:49:14.950 --> 03:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
to you know how can I handle this and
 
03:49:16.149 --> 03:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
this is where they would call an
 
03:49:18.910 --> 03:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
installer to come and you know take over
 
03:49:21.309 --> 03:49:21.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the system you know
 
03:49:24.389 --> 03:49:24.399 align:start position:0%
so uh we went you know it was a pretty
 
03:49:24.399 --> 03:49:25.510 align:start position:0%
so uh we went you know it was a pretty
significant

03:49:25.510 --> 03:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
significant
 
03:49:28.750 --> 03:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
number uh in the years past it's fewer
 
03:49:31.189 --> 03:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
now uh but what I feel like is good
 
03:49:35.030 --> 03:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
about this legislation is it it really
 
03:49:36.990 --> 03:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
takes the ambiguity out of when this is
 
03:49:38.950 --> 03:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
allowable and when it isn't and the
 
03:49:41.389 --> 03:49:41.399 align:start position:0%
process someone needs to follow if they
 
03:49:43.469 --> 03:49:43.479 align:start position:0%
want to do this homeowner installation I
 
03:49:46.229 --> 03:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
expect it won't be large numbers that
 
03:49:49.469 --> 03:49:49.479 align:start position:0%
can meet these um can meet these
 
03:49:52.590 --> 03:49:52.600 align:start position:0%
requirements but I think for those that
 
03:49:58.510 --> 03:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:02.110 --> 03:50:02.120 align:start position:0%
do anyone else for for a
 
03:50:05.670 --> 03:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
question seeing none thank you very much
 
03:50:08.229 --> 03:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:11.510 --> 03:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
much having no more F
 
03:50:15.269 --> 03:50:15.279 align:start position:0%
cards I'll bring the uh
 
03:50:17.229 --> 03:50:17.239 align:start position:0%
hearing to a
 
03:50:23.790 --> 03:50:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:23.800 --> 03:50:28.229 align:start position:0%
 
1140

03:50:28.229 --> 03:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:31.750 --> 03:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
we I don't know you think we should go
 
03:50:37.750 --> 03:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
on head on this one or not prob probably
 
03:50:41.030 --> 03:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
probably wait
 
03:50:43.590 --> 03:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
you want to reject this one or not or we
 
03:50:47.990 --> 03:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
have no okay I see people I see some
 
03:50:48.000 --> 03:50:49.110 align:start position:0%
have no okay I see people I see some
questions

03:50:49.110 --> 03:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:50:51.950 --> 03:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
um look of angst on some people's face
 
03:50:55.550 --> 03:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
so we won't we not go we will not
 
03:50:55.560 --> 03:50:58.910 align:start position:0%
so we won't we not go we will not
exercise

03:50:58.910 --> 03:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:01.429 --> 03:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
the we'll proceed with
 
03:51:06.550 --> 03:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:10.149 --> 03:51:10.159 align:start position:0%
just we're about to L theum I think
 
03:51:12.349 --> 03:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
we got to decide now yeah speak now
 
03:51:38.149 --> 03:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:38.159 --> 03:52:08.070 align:start position:0%
 
peace

03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:08.080 align:start position:0%

relative to requirements for approval to
 
04:05:39.510 --> 04:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
increase load on a sewage Disposal
 
04:05:42.429 --> 04:05:42.439 align:start position:0%
system representative representative
 
04:05:44.990 --> 04:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
makoni the floor is yours thank you Mr
 
04:05:46.910 --> 04:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
04:05:49.269 --> 04:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
members um I'm here for the introduction
 
04:05:53.389 --> 04:05:53.399 align:start position:0%
House Bill uh 1141 disposal relative
 
04:05:55.189 --> 04:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
requirements for approval to increase
 
04:05:58.309 --> 04:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
load on a sewage Disposal system I was
 
04:06:02.149 --> 04:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
asked by the department to bring forth
 
04:06:05.910 --> 04:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh several new uh changes and this is
 
04:06:08.630 --> 04:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
one of them and without having to listen
 
04:06:11.389 --> 04:06:11.399 align:start position:0%
to me once again I would defer to the
 
04:06:13.910 --> 04:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
department Mr rbridge to explain the
 
04:06:16.590 --> 04:06:16.600 align:start position:0%
necessity of this
 
04:06:16.600 --> 04:06:21.070 align:start position:0%
necessity of this
legislation

04:06:21.070 --> 04:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:22.880 --> 04:06:22.890 align:start position:0%

okay once
[Laughter]

04:06:32.590 --> 04:06:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:36.910 --> 04:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
Shy all right after M Mr chairman
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:06:40.910 --> 04:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
my name is Philip trobridge manager of
 
04:06:42.269 --> 04:06:42.279 align:start position:0%
the land resources program at New
 
04:06:44.750 --> 04:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees representative makoni has
 
04:06:46.070 --> 04:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
done such an excellent job of
 
04:06:47.790 --> 04:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
introducing all the other
 
04:06:52.750 --> 04:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
bills now I have to uh do this one uh so
 
04:06:55.429 --> 04:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
I'll give the background on this bill um
 
04:06:59.070 --> 04:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
there's a section of the statute uh 45a
 
04:07:01.550 --> 04:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
38 you know regarding you know what what
 
04:07:03.790 --> 04:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
we do when someone there's an existing
 
04:07:05.389 --> 04:07:05.399 align:start position:0%
structure and there's going to be an
 
04:07:07.429 --> 04:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
increase uh some sort of change to that
 
04:07:09.309 --> 04:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
structure either it changed to the size
 
04:07:12.590 --> 04:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
of it or changed to the occupancy or
 
04:07:13.670 --> 04:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
something that's going to affect the
 
04:07:13.680 --> 04:07:14.670 align:start position:0%
something that's going to affect the
septic

04:07:14.670 --> 04:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
septic
 
04:07:17.349 --> 04:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
system um and we found that there's
 
04:07:18.590 --> 04:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of things that need to
 
04:07:21.630 --> 04:07:21.640 align:start position:0%
be fixed um the the way the statues
 
04:07:24.070 --> 04:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
written now it it it really talks about
 
04:07:26.750 --> 04:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
um you know expanding a structure or
 
04:07:29.349 --> 04:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
occupying um the structure at you know
 
04:07:31.229 --> 04:07:31.239 align:start position:0%
more than uh part you know going from
 
04:07:33.830 --> 04:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
part-time to full-time occupancy as you
 
04:07:36.510 --> 04:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
know ways to increase the load but we've
 
04:07:38.950 --> 04:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
learned in um recent years is that
 
04:07:40.349 --> 04:07:40.359 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other ways you can
 
04:07:43.070 --> 04:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
increase the load on a septic system uh
 
04:07:46.109 --> 04:07:46.119 align:start position:0%
most notably uh bringing in um a a
 
04:07:49.550 --> 04:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen kitchen operation um
 
04:07:51.790 --> 04:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of home businesses sprang up
 
04:07:54.389 --> 04:07:54.399 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic where people are
 
04:07:56.870 --> 04:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
making uh you know going from you know
 
04:07:58.189 --> 04:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
just doing their normal cooking to
 
04:08:01.030 --> 04:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
making things for products for sale and
 
04:08:02.670 --> 04:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
and there there's a lot of food waste
 
04:08:05.229 --> 04:08:05.239 align:start position:0%
that goes down the drain in that case
 
04:08:06.830 --> 04:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
there's also a lot of fat oils and
 
04:08:09.229 --> 04:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
grease that go down the drain so that
 
04:08:12.389 --> 04:08:12.399 align:start position:0%
that chemical load is also an increased
 
04:08:14.910 --> 04:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
load um and we we found ourselves in
 
04:08:17.070 --> 04:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
debate with some applicants in the past
 
04:08:19.229 --> 04:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
because they're saying well I mean I'm
 
04:08:22.070 --> 04:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
not expanding the structure I'm not
 
04:08:24.070 --> 04:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
changing the occupancy but you know
 
04:08:25.429 --> 04:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
we're trying to tell you that your
 
04:08:27.590 --> 04:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
system is going to go into failure if
 
04:08:29.830 --> 04:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
you don't you know increase the capacity
 
04:08:32.229 --> 04:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
of it so what the one of the first
 
04:08:36.750 --> 04:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
changes that we have in the bill um on
 
04:08:39.990 --> 04:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh lines three and four is just
 
04:08:43.269 --> 04:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
basically saying any change in use um
 
04:08:45.030 --> 04:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
you know to it's kind of Encompass all
 
04:08:46.590 --> 04:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
the situations where you could have a
 
04:08:50.349 --> 04:08:50.359 align:start position:0%
change in use that would require um some
 
04:08:52.309 --> 04:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
sort of Permitting and I should be clear
 
04:08:53.950 --> 04:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
what happens when when someone has a
 
04:08:55.990 --> 04:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
change in use is they either have to
 
04:08:57.910 --> 04:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
demonstrate to us that their system has
 
04:09:00.830 --> 04:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
the capacity for the new use which is
 
04:09:02.070 --> 04:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
which can happen people can have
 
04:09:02.080 --> 04:09:03.389 align:start position:0%
which can happen people can have
oversized

04:09:03.389 --> 04:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
oversized
 
04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
systems uh and you know they're adding a
 
04:09:08.109 --> 04:09:08.119 align:start position:0%
bedroom but they had built a set larger
 
04:09:10.510 --> 04:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
septic system originally and so the
 
04:09:13.309 --> 04:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
everything works out um or they have to
 
04:09:15.830 --> 04:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
have a design for a system that can
 
04:09:18.630 --> 04:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
handle their use and the design
 
04:09:20.429 --> 04:09:20.439 align:start position:0%
basically says you have the space and
 
04:09:23.990 --> 04:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
you can meet the lot loading um for that
 
04:09:27.229 --> 04:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
system um and so then you know that that
 
04:09:30.910 --> 04:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:34.870 --> 04:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
approvals uh the statute is one of the
 
04:09:38.109 --> 04:09:38.119 align:start position:0%
harder statutes to follow um for
 
04:09:43.790 --> 04:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
as you get further down uh Roman uh 2- a
 
04:09:46.670 --> 04:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
talks about cases where you're doing
 
04:09:48.429 --> 04:09:48.439 align:start position:0%
some change of use but you're not
 
04:09:49.830 --> 04:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
increasing the
 
04:09:52.590 --> 04:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
load and it's exempting that from
 
04:09:54.389 --> 04:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
permitting it's not in the bill or I
 
04:09:56.309 --> 04:09:56.319 align:start position:0%
guess it is part of it's in the bill but
 
04:09:58.670 --> 04:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
if you're looking at the actual statute
 
04:10:01.550 --> 04:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
and and what that is is saying is that
 
04:10:03.710 --> 04:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
if you're you know you're not changing
 
04:10:08.429 --> 04:10:08.439 align:start position:0%
the use or not changing the load um uh
 
04:10:10.990 --> 04:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
and you have a state approved system you
 
04:10:12.510 --> 04:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
know you don't need to come in for
 
04:10:14.750 --> 04:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
permitting there was also an exemption
 
04:10:16.990 --> 04:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
of if if you were on a lot that was more
 
04:10:18.189 --> 04:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
than five
 
04:10:20.670 --> 04:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
acres and uh when that was put in the
 
04:10:22.750 --> 04:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
statute originally it was a way to make
 
04:10:24.229 --> 04:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
things a little bit easier for
 
04:10:27.710 --> 04:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Parks because uh
 
04:10:29.550 --> 04:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
there would be uh units that were sort
 
04:10:31.389 --> 04:10:31.399 align:start position:0%
of coming on the site and going off the
 
04:10:33.630 --> 04:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
site and um there might be some small
 
04:10:36.030 --> 04:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
changes to the structure but you know we
 
04:10:39.710 --> 04:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to facilitate permitting for that
 
04:10:43.030 --> 04:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
um the problem has been is it what we're
 
04:10:46.309 --> 04:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
seeking to add now is to say if the lot
 
04:10:49.109 --> 04:10:49.119 align:start position:0%
is more than five acres in size and is
 
04:10:52.109 --> 04:10:52.119 align:start position:0%
served by an approved septic system
 
04:10:53.790 --> 04:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
would would have this
 
04:10:57.349 --> 04:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
exemption um because it's been 50 years
 
04:10:59.790 --> 04:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
plus since the
 
04:11:02.269 --> 04:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
subsurface uh jurisdiction
 
04:11:05.870 --> 04:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
began uh and it it doesn't make a lot of
 
04:11:09.790 --> 04:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
sense to to allow you know a 60-year-old
 
04:11:12.469 --> 04:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
system that was substandard to continue
 
04:11:15.790 --> 04:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
to be used um if there's going to be you
 
04:11:18.670 --> 04:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
know a new building brought
 
04:11:23.030 --> 04:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
in um so I think when the the 5 acre um
 
04:11:25.510 --> 04:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
exemption was put in you know people
 
04:11:27.189 --> 04:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
there were there is it was to facilitate
 
04:11:28.630 --> 04:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
this work on mobile home parks but it
 
04:11:30.189 --> 04:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
was also someone thought well if you got
 
04:11:32.469 --> 04:11:32.479 align:start position:0%
five acres you know you're unlikely to
 
04:11:34.109 --> 04:11:34.119 align:start position:0%
be impacting your neighbors you know
 
04:11:36.309 --> 04:11:36.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of flexibility here uh but
 
04:11:38.070 --> 04:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
when you have a kind of a d densely
 
04:11:41.229 --> 04:11:41.239 align:start position:0%
packed uh manufactured housing Park and
 
04:11:44.030 --> 04:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
a number of systems that are very old
 
04:11:47.030 --> 04:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
and not state approved um I think for
 
04:11:49.189 --> 04:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
water quality protections uh it's
 
04:11:51.990 --> 04:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
prudent to require that those come up to
 
04:11:52.000 --> 04:11:54.429 align:start position:0%
prudent to require that those come up to
current

04:11:54.429 --> 04:11:54.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:57.349 --> 04:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
code uh so the the department supports
 
04:12:00.550 --> 04:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
this bill um we think it will clarify
 
04:12:02.030 --> 04:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
for applicants when they need to come in
 
04:12:05.469 --> 04:12:05.479 align:start position:0%
for permitting and it also um you know
 
04:12:08.309 --> 04:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
removes that loophole of the acre
 
04:12:10.910 --> 04:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
Parcels uh that is has the potential to
 
04:12:13.910 --> 04:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:16.269 --> 04:12:16.279 align:start position:0%
quality thank you and I'm happy to take
 
04:12:16.279 --> 04:12:17.590 align:start position:0%
quality thank you and I'm happy to take
your

04:12:17.590 --> 04:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:12:19.830 --> 04:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative harb and
 
04:12:22.269 --> 04:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
representative Horan thank you for
 
04:12:23.389 --> 04:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
04:12:26.550 --> 04:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
question um my question is on the
 
04:12:30.269 --> 04:12:30.279 align:start position:0%
amendment B and C I'm just wondering why
 
04:12:33.870 --> 04:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
don't you have a number of years from
 
04:12:36.030 --> 04:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
approval of construction because and a
 
04:12:37.510 --> 04:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
allot the other bills sometimes stimes
 
04:12:40.389 --> 04:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
they say if it's more than 20 years you
 
04:12:42.429 --> 04:12:42.439 align:start position:0%
still need to come back there's no year
 
04:12:44.389 --> 04:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
here and you just mentioned you've been
 
04:12:46.389 --> 04:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
in business 50 years so I could have a
 
04:12:49.950 --> 04:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
50y old approved system yeah excellent
 
04:12:53.830 --> 04:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
point um if you if you look at the full
 
04:12:56.309 --> 04:12:56.319 align:start position:0%
statute there there's an a above that
 
04:12:59.030 --> 04:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
that um is you know the lot is served by
 
04:13:01.510 --> 04:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
a system that's with it was approved
 
04:13:05.269 --> 04:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
within 20 years so we already do have
 
04:13:08.109 --> 04:13:08.119 align:start position:0%
that 20year cut off it would be
 
04:13:08.119 --> 04:13:08.830 align:start position:0%
that 20year cut off it would be
I

04:13:08.830 --> 04:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:13:11.790 --> 04:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
think uh fine to add the 20-year cut
 
04:13:14.309 --> 04:13:14.319 align:start position:0%
offs to B and C I think we were just
 
04:13:17.309 --> 04:13:17.319 align:start position:0%
trying to be as um as light a touch as
 
04:13:17.319 --> 04:13:18.990 align:start position:0%
trying to be as um as light a touch as
we

04:13:18.990 --> 04:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:13:21.510 --> 04:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
could and and so it's at the pleasure of
 
04:13:24.269 --> 04:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
the committee if you'd like to amend
 
04:13:27.670 --> 04:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
that follow for a followup just would
 
04:13:30.790 --> 04:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
like it to be consistent because if I
 
04:13:33.590 --> 04:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
file on to be with a 50y old system I'd
 
04:13:37.269 --> 04:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
still be okay but if you really want 20
 
04:13:40.710 --> 04:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
on a I just thought why don't we have 20
 
04:13:43.149 --> 04:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
on B and C sure
 
04:13:45.870 --> 04:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
okay my position but thank you for your
 
04:13:49.590 --> 04:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
comment thanks sen
 
04:13:51.750 --> 04:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
Morgan thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:13:53.750 --> 04:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh when we talk
 
04:13:55.950 --> 04:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
about expansion of the system or loading
 
04:13:58.429 --> 04:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
increasing the loading this could
 
04:14:00.510 --> 04:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
literally mean replacing the tank and
 
04:14:03.109 --> 04:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
the size of the Le field
 
04:14:06.269 --> 04:14:06.279 align:start position:0%
correct um essentially a new system yeah
 
04:14:09.389 --> 04:14:09.399 align:start position:0%
yeah normally it involves both um there
 
04:14:10.870 --> 04:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
there can be cases where someone has
 
04:14:14.030 --> 04:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
used an oversized tank you know and then
 
04:14:16.469 --> 04:14:16.479 align:start position:0%
does not need to change the tank but
 
04:14:18.309 --> 04:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
normally if their system the system is
 
04:14:20.469 --> 04:14:20.479 align:start position:0%
sized for a certain flow both the tank
 
04:14:21.990 --> 04:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
and a leech field and if they need to
 
04:14:24.750 --> 04:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
increase that flow they'd have to change
 
04:14:29.830 --> 04:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:32.429 --> 04:14:32.439 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
04:14:35.990 --> 04:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
trob for taking my question um the the
 
04:14:38.109 --> 04:14:38.119 align:start position:0%
addition of the language any change in
 
04:14:40.790 --> 04:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
use is that going to be defined
 
04:14:43.870 --> 04:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
anywhere um because there may be a
 
04:14:46.910 --> 04:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
homeowner that let's say they are having
 
04:14:49.030 --> 04:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
a home business and they figured I'm
 
04:14:51.070 --> 04:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
just making stuff in my home they may
 
04:14:54.229 --> 04:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
not regard that as a change in use is it
 
04:14:56.349 --> 04:14:56.359 align:start position:0%
going to be like how would people know
 
04:14:57.710 --> 04:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
that they would have to notify their
 
04:14:59.510 --> 04:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
apartment if they are starting like a
 
04:15:01.670 --> 04:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
home food
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
business that's a very good question um
 
04:15:06.469 --> 04:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
I I think the where I would start with
 
04:15:10.109 --> 04:15:10.119 align:start position:0%
the answer is um you know the full text
 
04:15:12.229 --> 04:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
would read any change in use which would
 
04:15:14.590 --> 04:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
increase the load on the sewage Disposal
 
04:15:17.750 --> 04:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
system um and so I think that that
 
04:15:19.469 --> 04:15:19.479 align:start position:0%
already constrains it so if you're
 
04:15:21.910 --> 04:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
starting a you know a knitting business
 
04:15:23.710 --> 04:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
or something you know obviously that's
 
04:15:27.189 --> 04:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
not going to uh change the the increase
 
04:15:30.830 --> 04:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
the load on the sewage um uh Disposal
 
04:15:35.590 --> 04:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
system um and uh so so we're already
 
04:15:39.710 --> 04:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
kind of constraining it that way way the
 
04:15:42.790 --> 04:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
question is you know if I'm you know
 
04:15:45.109 --> 04:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
just uh you know
 
04:15:48.550 --> 04:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
I've well let me break it down into some
 
04:15:53.309 --> 04:15:53.319 align:start position:0%
categories no we uh permit residences
 
04:15:55.550 --> 04:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
based on the number of bedrooms for
 
04:15:58.750 --> 04:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
example and there the assumption is that
 
04:16:01.030 --> 04:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
you know there's all the bedrooms are
 
04:16:03.109 --> 04:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
used and there you know there's so many
 
04:16:04.710 --> 04:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
people per bedroom so much flow per
 
04:16:06.710 --> 04:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
bedroom you can have cases where the
 
04:16:09.269 --> 04:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
kids go gone off to college and you know
 
04:16:10.750 --> 04:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
there's you still have a three-bedroom
 
04:16:12.750 --> 04:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
house but there's only two people living
 
04:16:16.670 --> 04:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
there um the we wouldn't consider that a
 
04:16:18.830 --> 04:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
change of use or a change of use if the
 
04:16:21.269 --> 04:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
kids come back you know like the the
 
04:16:22.670 --> 04:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
structure is still the same the number
 
04:16:24.750 --> 04:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
of bedrooms is the same so it's only if
 
04:16:25.910 --> 04:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
someone were to say I'm going to add a
 
04:16:28.870 --> 04:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
fourth bedroom or I'm going to add an
 
04:16:30.910 --> 04:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
Adu that we would say that that's a
 
04:16:31.830 --> 04:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
change in
 
04:16:35.590 --> 04:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
use um and then in terms of these home
 
04:16:38.030 --> 04:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
businesses um there's food licensing
 
04:16:40.790 --> 04:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
requirements that happen uh so when
 
04:16:43.590 --> 04:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
someone is um you know in some cases
 
04:16:46.550 --> 04:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
they need to get food licensing and they
 
04:16:51.109 --> 04:16:51.119 align:start position:0%
have to then check the health department
 
04:16:53.750 --> 04:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
DHHS uh needs something from us to
 
04:16:56.109 --> 04:16:56.119 align:start position:0%
verify that they have an approved septic
 
04:16:58.309 --> 04:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
system so that would be a time for us to
 
04:17:00.950 --> 04:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
be saying uh yeah we didn't uh they're
 
04:17:02.309 --> 04:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
not approved to have you know the ice
 
04:17:05.309 --> 04:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
cream stand or something like that um I
 
04:17:06.550 --> 04:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
know there's a number of bills in the
 
04:17:06.560 --> 04:17:07.550 align:start position:0%
know there's a number of bills in the
house

04:17:07.550 --> 04:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
house
 
04:17:09.630 --> 04:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
um this session regarding artisanal
 
04:17:12.229 --> 04:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
foods and I think you know recognizing
 
04:17:13.790 --> 04:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
that there's some you know very small
 
04:17:15.990 --> 04:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
scale operations and that they you know
 
04:17:17.910 --> 04:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
the permitting on those is going to be
 
04:17:19.750 --> 04:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
done handled in a certain way but when
 
04:17:21.710 --> 04:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
it reaches the threshold that it needs a
 
04:17:25.990 --> 04:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know a food license from DHHS then
 
04:17:29.389 --> 04:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:31.469 --> 04:17:31.479 align:start position:0%
notified any other questions
 
04:17:34.149 --> 04:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
representative Donald thank
 
04:17:37.229 --> 04:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
you it says a sewage disposal system
 
04:17:38.870 --> 04:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
does this mainly pertain to septic
 
04:17:43.309 --> 04:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
systems versus sore systems uh thank you
 
04:17:45.030 --> 04:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
for the question it's an excellent point
 
04:17:46.910 --> 04:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
yes and whenever possible we try and
 
04:17:48.590 --> 04:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
change it to septic system this was the
 
04:17:52.149 --> 04:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
older language that's been in 45a for
 
04:17:55.429 --> 04:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
forever um but yes sewage Disposal
 
04:17:57.910 --> 04:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
system you know on anything this is this
 
04:18:00.750 --> 04:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
is relating to septic Syms and not
 
04:18:04.149 --> 04:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
Municipal sewer Municipal sewer loads
 
04:18:05.750 --> 04:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
are handled through the you know sewer
 
04:18:08.030 --> 04:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
use ordinances things like
 
04:18:11.109 --> 04:18:11.119 align:start position:0%
that just thank
 
04:18:14.030 --> 04:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:18:16.229 --> 04:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
harb thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:18:18.389 --> 04:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
for taking this question I'm following
 
04:18:20.429 --> 04:18:20.439 align:start position:0%
on your idea of the change of use with
 
04:18:23.429 --> 04:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
the Adu if I had a three-bedroom place
 
04:18:27.189 --> 04:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
and then I put on a one-bedroom Adu but
 
04:18:29.790 --> 04:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
do we have a provision in our
 
04:18:31.990 --> 04:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
regulations that I could put a and a
 
04:18:34.269 --> 04:18:34.279 align:start position:0%
restriction on my property that says I'm
 
04:18:36.389 --> 04:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
only going to have so many bedrooms and
 
04:18:38.630 --> 04:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
I decommission one of the bedrooms in my
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
house to allow the
 
04:18:44.389 --> 04:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
Adu um that's a very good question I uh
 
04:18:46.269 --> 04:18:46.279 align:start position:0%
do not believe there is a way that we
 
04:18:48.670 --> 04:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
could could say uh I have a
 
04:18:50.950 --> 04:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
three-bedroom house but I'm you know
 
04:18:52.590 --> 04:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
we're only going to use two of it and
 
04:18:54.790 --> 04:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
there you know the the flow for the Adu
 
04:18:58.830 --> 04:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
is going to be you know the extra flow
 
04:19:00.469 --> 04:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
for the Adu is compensated by this
 
04:19:03.830 --> 04:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
reduced use of the bedroom uh no I don't
 
04:19:11.109 --> 04:19:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:13.590 --> 04:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else for a
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
question may maybe you sced of going I
 
04:19:18.670 --> 04:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
have I have a question going back to
 
04:19:21.950 --> 04:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
this change of use and taking and what
 
04:19:28.469 --> 04:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
uh representative harb puts speaks of
 
04:19:33.149 --> 04:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
bedrooms uh is can you can you make a
 
04:19:36.950 --> 04:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
bedroom can you make a bedroom a den
 
04:19:41.149 --> 04:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
when you make a bedroom a storage
 
04:19:41.159 --> 04:19:45.109 align:start position:0%
when you make a bedroom a storage
closet

04:19:45.109 --> 04:19:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh it yes any room can be converted to a
 
04:19:53.229 --> 04:19:53.239 align:start position:0%
bedroom but if you it depends what you
 
04:19:55.510 --> 04:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
want to call it at the time or is what
 
04:19:58.750 --> 04:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
you or is there you can do you have a a
 
04:20:00.349 --> 04:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
form that you can say I want to change
 
04:20:06.229 --> 04:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
this now from a bedroom to a den or a a
 
04:20:09.750 --> 04:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
place a kennel for my dog
 
04:20:13.269 --> 04:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
yeah very interesting scenario I I I
 
04:20:15.710 --> 04:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
believe a lot of this is handled at the
 
04:20:18.830 --> 04:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
local taxation level um in the
 
04:20:21.830 --> 04:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
assessments for the property um because
 
04:20:24.149 --> 04:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
you know that's normally what is the
 
04:20:26.349 --> 04:20:26.359 align:start position:0%
governing dis you know um description of
 
04:20:27.990 --> 04:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
the property is the number of bedrooms
 
04:20:29.109 --> 04:20:29.119 align:start position:0%
the number of
 
04:20:31.950 --> 04:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
bathrooms um you know over overall
 
04:20:36.750 --> 04:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
square footage um so it's not that that
 
04:20:39.469 --> 04:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
you the department is you can rece can
 
04:20:41.429 --> 04:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
make those decisions can say okay we
 
04:20:43.229 --> 04:20:43.239 align:start position:0%
received a petition now this is we've
 
04:20:45.149 --> 04:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
removed the closet it's no longer a
 
04:20:47.550 --> 04:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
bedroom it's a Den now my house is a
 
04:20:49.630 --> 04:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
two-bedroom I don't think anything we
 
04:20:54.389 --> 04:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
say would hold any sway over the town
 
04:20:56.309 --> 04:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
assessor who's going to say no that's
 
04:21:01.349 --> 04:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
still a three-bedroom house um and so
 
04:21:03.950 --> 04:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
that that really isn't our purview uh to
 
04:21:07.990 --> 04:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
make that decision just but
 
04:21:11.229 --> 04:21:11.239 align:start position:0%
the uh your but it maybe a three-bedroom
 
04:21:14.630 --> 04:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
house but if I if I'm calling it
 
04:21:18.189 --> 04:21:18.199 align:start position:0%
a so you are going by the decision of
 
04:21:23.870 --> 04:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
the Town assessor and not by the what
 
04:21:28.950 --> 04:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
what the uh you what the what the person
 
04:21:32.149 --> 04:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
say yes from an official record we are
 
04:21:34.070 --> 04:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
um when someone comes to us for approval
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
they're coming to say this is a
 
04:21:36.790 --> 04:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
three-bedroom house or so this is a
 
04:21:37.990 --> 04:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
four-bedroom house that's what the
 
04:21:39.950 --> 04:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
design is based on that's what the flows
 
04:21:41.710 --> 04:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
are based on and that and that you know
 
04:21:43.070 --> 04:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's mostly what we're looking at is
 
04:21:45.950 --> 04:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
what the application tells us um and I
 
04:21:47.870 --> 04:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
think what you're talking about is you
 
04:21:49.309 --> 04:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere down the line someone's been
 
04:21:52.189 --> 04:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
approved as a four-bedroom house they
 
04:21:54.550 --> 04:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
want to say no it's not four bedrooms
 
04:21:58.189 --> 04:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
it's you know three bedrooms and a
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
um and a large Den um I you know we have
 
04:22:05.429 --> 04:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
not been involved in those decisions
 
04:22:06.870 --> 04:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
because we
 
04:22:08.630 --> 04:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
we would go off of what the tax card
 
04:22:11.550 --> 04:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
shows us okay but let's say they were to
 
04:22:13.990 --> 04:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
say I want to be you know for I'm
 
04:22:15.710 --> 04:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
approved for four
 
04:22:19.030 --> 04:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
bedrooms and I'm what I'm converting it
 
04:22:24.309 --> 04:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
to is you know two bedrooms and an
 
04:22:27.550 --> 04:22:27.560 align:start position:0%
Adu you know the which is an Adu is
 
04:22:28.950 --> 04:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
Believe It or Not considered one and a
 
04:22:32.870 --> 04:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
half bed bedrooms just for flow uh uh
 
04:22:34.070 --> 04:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know that would be within the
 
04:22:35.750 --> 04:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
capacity of their septic system and it
 
04:22:38.510 --> 04:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
for us that would not be a change AB use
 
04:22:40.750 --> 04:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
okay that would increase the flow on the
 
04:22:40.760 --> 04:22:44.830 align:start position:0%
okay that would increase the flow on the
septic

04:22:44.830 --> 04:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:48.950 --> 04:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:51.950 --> 04:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
else seeing no one else thank you very
 
04:22:54.670 --> 04:22:54.680 align:start position:0%
much all right thank you very much I
 
04:22:58.710 --> 04:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:01.670 --> 04:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
cards and unfortunately we cannot hurry
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
up we have to wait around so the
 
04:23:05.279 --> 04:23:06.910 align:start position:0%
up we have to wait around so the
uh

de Floor is yours thank you Mr chair
 
05:05:27.510 --> 05:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
05:05:29.390 --> 05:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
my name is Philip trobridge I'm the
 
05:05:31.390 --> 05:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
manager of the land resources program at
 
05:05:34.548 --> 05:05:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:37.230 --> 05:05:37.240 align:start position:0%
um for a bill that we heard earlier
 
05:05:40.788 --> 05:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
today uh HB 1140 we already discussed
 
05:05:43.270 --> 05:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
some of the reasons you know uh for
 
05:05:45.390 --> 05:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
having the requirements to be licensed
 
05:05:47.670 --> 05:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
to or to be permitted to install a
 
05:05:50.750 --> 05:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
septic system um just I think to
 
05:05:53.548 --> 05:05:53.558 align:start position:0%
underscore the importance of it um when
 
05:05:55.628 --> 05:05:55.638 align:start position:0%
someone the types of skills that we're
 
05:05:57.990 --> 05:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
looking for when someone is getting the
 
05:06:01.110 --> 05:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
permit from us is uh they must pass an
 
05:06:04.350 --> 05:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
exam uh on the topics such as septic
 
05:06:06.830 --> 05:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
system design and installation
 
05:06:10.548 --> 05:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
procedures drafting plans to scale
 
05:06:13.310 --> 05:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
regulations regarding sewage loading and
 
05:06:15.390 --> 05:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
setbacks and acceptable field
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
adjustments from approved plans um this
 
05:06:21.430 --> 05:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
is uh this permitting is necessary for
 
05:06:22.868 --> 05:06:22.878 align:start position:0%
protecting Public Health in the
 
05:06:25.030 --> 05:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
environment uh because if the system is
 
05:06:27.590 --> 05:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
not designed and and installed properly
 
05:06:30.350 --> 05:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
it will fail prematurely resulting in an
 
05:06:34.030 --> 05:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
immediate public health hazard
 
05:06:35.708 --> 05:06:35.718 align:start position:0%
so this bill
 
05:06:38.270 --> 05:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
hb142 pertains to the requirements to
 
05:06:39.788 --> 05:06:39.798 align:start position:0%
obtain such a
 
05:06:43.670 --> 05:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
license um DS runs the permitting
 
05:06:47.070 --> 05:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
program to to uh to issue the installer
 
05:06:48.390 --> 05:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
and designer
 
05:06:51.708 --> 05:06:51.718 align:start position:0%
permits we hold exams for these uh both
 
05:06:54.390 --> 05:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
of these permits twice per year and last
 
05:06:57.230 --> 05:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
year we had over 200 candidates uh
 
05:06:59.390 --> 05:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
combined for installers and designers
 
05:07:01.030 --> 05:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
who took the
 
05:07:04.868 --> 05:07:04.878 align:start position:0%
exam however I I regret to say that over
 
05:07:09.110 --> 05:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
80% of those taking the exams did not
 
05:07:12.390 --> 05:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
pass um many of these people then retake
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
the exam um which drives up the number
 
05:07:18.190 --> 05:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
of people in the exams uh and it also
 
05:07:20.788 --> 05:07:20.798 align:start position:0%
increases the state resources to
 
05:07:24.470 --> 05:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
administer this exam to large numbers of
 
05:07:27.390 --> 05:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
people uh the root of the problem from
 
05:07:29.708 --> 05:07:29.718 align:start position:0%
our perspective is that uh people think
 
05:07:31.708 --> 05:07:31.718 align:start position:0%
they can pass the exam by just reading
 
05:07:32.868 --> 05:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
the de
 
05:07:35.670 --> 05:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh subsurface system rules and that's
 
05:07:37.750 --> 05:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
part of it some of those things we need
 
05:07:40.670 --> 05:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
to know um but they also need this a
 
05:07:43.030 --> 05:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
foundation in preparing and reading
 
05:07:47.110 --> 05:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
plans and construction techniques um
 
05:07:49.670 --> 05:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
these there's not a lot of opportunities
 
05:07:52.910 --> 05:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
for um classes in which to learn that
 
05:07:55.030 --> 05:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
there were more opportunities in the
 
05:07:58.548 --> 05:07:58.558 align:start position:0%
past um and what we found is the most
 
05:08:00.230 --> 05:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
effective way to obtain these skills is
 
05:08:02.310 --> 05:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
through OB on the job training working
 
05:08:04.190 --> 05:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
under someone who's already permitted to
 
05:08:08.270 --> 05:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
be a licensed a permitted installer or
 
05:08:11.470 --> 05:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
designer uh and so taking a cue from
 
05:08:14.510 --> 05:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
some of the other uh uh certification
 
05:08:16.590 --> 05:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
boards associated with
 
05:08:19.470 --> 05:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
Dees um we looked at their regulations
 
05:08:22.310 --> 05:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
and and we saw that some of those
 
05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
require um a few years of experience in
 
05:08:28.110 --> 05:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
the trade before you can sit for the
 
05:08:30.670 --> 05:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
exam and uh so we thought that that
 
05:08:32.990 --> 05:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
would be the you know appropriate way to
 
05:08:35.230 --> 05:08:35.240 align:start position:0%
add to the requirements for the exam is
 
05:08:37.270 --> 05:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
to require this training in the field of
 
05:08:40.390 --> 05:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
septic system installation and design uh
 
05:08:42.788 --> 05:08:42.798 align:start position:0%
two years for the case of a designer and
 
05:08:44.708 --> 05:08:44.718 align:start position:0%
one year in the case of an
 
05:08:47.670 --> 05:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
installer um and you know allow them to
 
05:08:49.510 --> 05:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
sit for the that that they need to
 
05:08:51.548 --> 05:08:51.558 align:start position:0%
demonstrate to us before they could uh
 
05:08:54.270 --> 05:08:54.280 align:start position:0%
register for the
 
05:08:58.990 --> 05:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
exam uh so you know this is a uh you
 
05:09:00.310 --> 05:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
know the department brought this
 
05:09:03.270 --> 05:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
language to representative mccon
 
05:09:05.830 --> 05:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
um at this point in our our letters
 
05:09:07.470 --> 05:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
we're we're not taking a position and
 
05:09:10.750 --> 05:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
I'll explain why um it's we we we've
 
05:09:11.990 --> 05:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
received some questions since we brought
 
05:09:14.510 --> 05:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
it up about how this bill relates to
 
05:09:15.830 --> 05:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
some of the bills that were in the in
 
05:09:19.470 --> 05:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
the past session um hb2 regarding um
 
05:09:22.470 --> 05:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
licensing certifications for a number of
 
05:09:24.628 --> 05:09:24.638 align:start position:0%
professionals um and that sought to
 
05:09:27.350 --> 05:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
reduce licensing requirements so we
 
05:09:29.070 --> 05:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
thought our approach should be just to
 
05:09:31.548 --> 05:09:31.558 align:start position:0%
provide the technical information about
 
05:09:32.708 --> 05:09:32.718 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
05:09:35.030 --> 05:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
to the committee and leave the the
 
05:09:37.350 --> 05:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
decision to the
 
05:09:39.310 --> 05:09:39.320 align:start position:0%
legislature uh should this committee
 
05:09:40.670 --> 05:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
decide to move forward with the bill we
 
05:09:43.310 --> 05:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
do recommend an amendment uh which is uh
 
05:09:46.868 --> 05:09:46.878 align:start position:0%
listed on page two of the letter um and
 
05:09:50.948 --> 05:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
it's it's um just the addition of few
 
05:09:52.708 --> 05:09:52.718 align:start position:0%
sentences to give us rul making
 
05:09:56.230 --> 05:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
Authority related to these exams uh and
 
05:09:59.670 --> 05:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
that would be necessary so that we can U
 
05:10:03.470 --> 05:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
specify the types of uh
 
05:10:04.788 --> 05:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
on the job training that would be
 
05:10:08.030 --> 05:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
acceptable for the one to two years um
 
05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
and that's the way some of the other
 
05:10:11.948 --> 05:10:11.958 align:start position:0%
certification programs do this they they
 
05:10:14.470 --> 05:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
have a broad requirement in statute and
 
05:10:16.628 --> 05:10:16.638 align:start position:0%
then have rules that say you know these
 
05:10:19.110 --> 05:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
are if you do these things um this
 
05:10:21.310 --> 05:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
counts as you're on the job
 
05:10:22.948 --> 05:10:22.958 align:start position:0%
training so thank you for the
 
05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify and I'm happy to
 
05:10:27.030 --> 05:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:27.040 --> 05:10:30.110 align:start position:0%
 
questions

05:10:30.110 --> 05:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:33.948 --> 05:10:33.958 align:start position:0%
representative I okay
 
05:10:33.958 --> 05:10:36.230 align:start position:0%
representative I okay
yeah

05:10:36.230 --> 05:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:10:39.510 --> 05:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay earlier we said uh you we had said
 
05:10:42.270 --> 05:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
that this wasn't rocket science um I
 
05:10:43.390 --> 05:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
just want to know how you came up with
 
05:10:44.788 --> 05:10:44.798 align:start position:0%
the two
 
05:10:47.510 --> 05:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
years thank you for your question um we
 
05:10:49.510 --> 05:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
we looked at the other programs and some
 
05:10:52.230 --> 05:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
of them um required three years some of
 
05:10:56.270 --> 05:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
them required um less and I think we we
 
05:10:59.030 --> 05:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
made a judgment call as to you know that
 
05:11:02.150 --> 05:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
this would you know no how many years um
 
05:11:05.548 --> 05:11:05.558 align:start position:0%
would seem appropriate for the level of
 
05:11:07.110 --> 05:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility and so we thought there
 
05:11:09.310 --> 05:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
should be a higher number of years for
 
05:11:10.830 --> 05:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
the designers because it's a more
 
05:11:10.840 --> 05:11:12.030 align:start position:0%
the designers because it's a more
complicated

05:11:12.030 --> 05:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
05:11:14.990 --> 05:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
task uh and then less so for the
 
05:11:17.548 --> 05:11:17.558 align:start position:0%
installers and so you know it's it uh
 
05:11:18.708 --> 05:11:18.718 align:start position:0%
that's where we came up with the two
 
05:11:26.990 --> 05:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:29.190 --> 05:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
installers thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:11:33.670 --> 05:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
Mr troid for taking my question um so
 
05:11:35.350 --> 05:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
just looking at the situation with
 
05:11:37.628 --> 05:11:37.638 align:start position:0%
people trying to get contractors in the
 
05:11:41.548 --> 05:11:41.558 align:start position:0%
state would this slow things down um for
 
05:11:44.430 --> 05:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
getting somebody um licensed or would it
 
05:11:48.190 --> 05:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
speed things up an excellent question um
 
05:11:50.190 --> 05:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
it is our sincere hope that this speeds
 
05:11:54.390 --> 05:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
things up um the the pass rate on this
 
05:11:58.948 --> 05:11:58.958 align:start position:0%
exam is a very frustrating to me um we
 
05:12:01.190 --> 05:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
are spend a lot of time preparing the
 
05:12:04.070 --> 05:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
exam and admiss ing the exam and doing
 
05:12:07.548 --> 05:12:07.558 align:start position:0%
Outreach about the exam and uh and yet
 
05:12:10.070 --> 05:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
our pass rate is not you know improved
 
05:12:11.548 --> 05:12:11.558 align:start position:0%
in the last few years since I've been in
 
05:12:12.670 --> 05:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
charge of the
 
05:12:15.590 --> 05:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
program uh and so we did some hard
 
05:12:17.590 --> 05:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
thinking about what we could do to try
 
05:12:19.948 --> 05:12:19.958 align:start position:0%
and change that course to change that
 
05:12:22.708 --> 05:12:22.718 align:start position:0%
trajectory because we have you know a
 
05:12:24.270 --> 05:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
certain number of people who are
 
05:12:27.510 --> 05:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
retiring from the trade each year as
 
05:12:29.110 --> 05:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
designers and installers and we need to
 
05:12:32.830 --> 05:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
replace those people uh so I think this
 
05:12:36.150 --> 05:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
will will um will help because people
 
05:12:37.750 --> 05:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
will have the foundation that they need
 
05:12:40.590 --> 05:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
and as we look at the new exam or at the
 
05:12:42.750 --> 05:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
exam sorry not as we're looking newly at
 
05:12:45.270 --> 05:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
the exam we've been trying to pinpoint
 
05:12:47.990 --> 05:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
where people are getting it wrong and
 
05:12:49.190 --> 05:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
we've been finding it's these
 
05:12:52.430 --> 05:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
foundational things of how to read a
 
05:12:55.548 --> 05:12:55.558 align:start position:0%
plan uh you know how to prepare
 
05:12:57.910 --> 05:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
something from scratch as opposed to
 
05:13:02.230 --> 05:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
using a computer a design program and
 
05:13:04.070 --> 05:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
these exams are administered you know in
 
05:13:06.510 --> 05:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
the office you know with pen and paper
 
05:13:08.430 --> 05:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
uh but when there people who work in the
 
05:13:09.788 --> 05:13:09.798 align:start position:0%
you know who've had experience but
 
05:13:11.830 --> 05:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
they're using some sort of computer
 
05:13:15.030 --> 05:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
program that uh generates a lot of the
 
05:13:16.750 --> 05:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
you know information a lot of the design
 
05:13:20.150 --> 05:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
for them uh so you know we really need
 
05:13:21.750 --> 05:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
to back up and make sure people have
 
05:13:25.190 --> 05:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
those foundational skills uh and we are
 
05:13:27.910 --> 05:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
outside of this effort working with the
 
05:13:30.230 --> 05:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
community college system and the UN UNH
 
05:13:32.830 --> 05:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
system to try and develop veloped like a
 
05:13:32.840 --> 05:13:33.548 align:start position:0%
system to try and develop veloped like a
A

05:13:33.548 --> 05:13:33.558 align:start position:0%
A
 
05:13:36.548 --> 05:13:36.558 align:start position:0%
noncredit or non-degree program that
 
05:13:39.350 --> 05:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
would support water professionals and do
 
05:13:40.990 --> 05:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development not just for
 
05:13:42.910 --> 05:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
septic system installers and designers
 
05:13:45.270 --> 05:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
but uh other natural resource
 
05:13:47.708 --> 05:13:47.718 align:start position:0%
professionals such as uh well
 
05:13:51.470 --> 05:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
drillers um Wetland scientists surveyors
 
05:13:55.390 --> 05:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
soil scientists and these are um skills
 
05:13:57.310 --> 05:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
that we're going to need for the growing
 
05:13:59.590 --> 05:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
State and uh they're very practical
 
05:14:01.430 --> 05:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
skills and they're a good way to make a
 
05:14:01.440 --> 05:14:02.390 align:start position:0%
skills and they're a good way to make a
living

05:14:02.390 --> 05:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
living
 
05:14:04.070 --> 05:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
and working in the state they jobs that
 
05:14:06.708 --> 05:14:06.718 align:start position:0%
can't be sent offshore we think this is
 
05:14:09.230 --> 05:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
a win-win and we'd like to continue on
 
05:14:09.240 --> 05:14:10.510 align:start position:0%
a win-win and we'd like to continue on
that

05:14:10.510 --> 05:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:14:14.150 --> 05:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
effort for a followup um you had said
 
05:14:18.510 --> 05:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
80% failure rate or did I get that wrong
 
05:14:21.708 --> 05:14:21.718 align:start position:0%
correct 80% of the people on taking this
 
05:14:25.548 --> 05:14:25.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:29.670 --> 05:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
it yes and I I can say that you know in
 
05:14:32.510 --> 05:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
preparing this letter I I wanted to say
 
05:14:34.830 --> 05:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of people don't pass it but we
 
05:14:36.548 --> 05:14:36.558 align:start position:0%
thought it was appropriate to say the
 
05:14:36.558 --> 05:14:38.788 align:start position:0%
thought it was appropriate to say the
actual

05:14:38.788 --> 05:14:38.798 align:start position:0%
actual
 
05:14:41.990 --> 05:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
number I
 
05:14:44.470 --> 05:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
agree thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
 
05:14:46.750 --> 05:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
chage for taking my question um what
 
05:14:48.510 --> 05:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
type of feedback have you had from
 
05:14:50.390 --> 05:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
people in the industry because they
 
05:14:52.470 --> 05:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
would now have people working for them
 
05:14:55.430 --> 05:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
that you know aren't
 
05:14:58.150 --> 05:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
licensed uh think a good question uh you
 
05:14:59.910 --> 05:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
know currently that that's kind of the
 
05:15:01.628 --> 05:15:01.638 align:start position:0%
arrangement there is there's people who
 
05:15:03.470 --> 05:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
who who do work under someone else's
 
05:15:06.430 --> 05:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
license so this wouldn't be a a big
 
05:15:10.270 --> 05:15:10.280 align:start position:0%
change um and I think it formalizes that
 
05:15:12.750 --> 05:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
process and I think it uh would allow
 
05:15:18.628 --> 05:15:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:21.150 --> 05:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
environment Derby thank you Mr chair
 
05:15:22.350 --> 05:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question just
 
05:15:25.430 --> 05:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
very related to what representative rung
 
05:15:29.190 --> 05:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
just asked um what types of um what
 
05:15:32.628 --> 05:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
types of roles can unlce
 
05:15:35.670 --> 05:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
um employee do for a designer somebody
 
05:15:38.628 --> 05:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
that would be taking the designer um
 
05:15:39.990 --> 05:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
test as opposed to somebody that would
 
05:15:42.708 --> 05:15:42.718 align:start position:0%
be taking the installment test it's an
 
05:15:44.150 --> 05:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
excellent question I'd like to defer
 
05:15:46.030 --> 05:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
that question to representative makoni
 
05:15:47.948 --> 05:15:47.958 align:start position:0%
because I think he's had uh direct
 
05:15:51.708 --> 05:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:56.030 --> 05:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
that anyone else for Mr
 
05:15:59.150 --> 05:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
TR representative harp thank you Mr
 
05:16:01.788 --> 05:16:01.798 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr trober was any
 
05:16:05.510 --> 05:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
thought given to if somebody is required
 
05:16:08.788 --> 05:16:08.798 align:start position:0%
to do all these studies under these
 
05:16:11.670 --> 05:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
licensed supervisions that they could
 
05:16:15.190 --> 05:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
automatically then get the license and
 
05:16:19.070 --> 05:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
not have to take the test uh thank you
 
05:16:21.830 --> 05:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
for that um question representative harb
 
05:16:24.310 --> 05:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh we we had not considered that because
 
05:16:26.430 --> 05:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
the because the statute requires the
 
05:16:29.628 --> 05:16:29.638 align:start position:0%
exam you know um and so you know that's
 
05:16:30.948 --> 05:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
a thing that we're needing to do so we'
 
05:16:33.788 --> 05:16:33.798 align:start position:0%
need to change that um one thing that we
 
05:16:37.430 --> 05:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
did think is that there um you know we
 
05:16:40.390 --> 05:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
could add um you know right now we're
 
05:16:42.670 --> 05:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
being quite explicit about one to two
 
05:16:45.788 --> 05:16:45.798 align:start position:0%
years um there if there was interest
 
05:16:48.948 --> 05:16:48.958 align:start position:0%
from the committee on more flexibility
 
05:16:51.548 --> 05:16:51.558 align:start position:0%
uh there could be discussion of one to
 
05:16:54.070 --> 05:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
two years or equivalent which might
 
05:16:57.510 --> 05:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
allow for some combination of training
 
05:16:59.390 --> 05:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
you know classes and training you know
 
05:17:00.708 --> 05:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
that and that could be further spelled
 
05:17:03.350 --> 05:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
out in in
 
05:17:06.788 --> 05:17:06.798 align:start position:0%
rule follow follow up so you're not
 
05:17:10.510 --> 05:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to something
 
05:17:13.190 --> 05:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
that they could take the test earlier
 
05:17:15.510 --> 05:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
maybe if it requires the
 
05:17:18.590 --> 05:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
test this almost looks like if I have to
 
05:17:21.110 --> 05:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
do two years with a designer I can't
 
05:17:23.548 --> 05:17:23.558 align:start position:0%
take the test then I might be Albert
 
05:17:27.030 --> 05:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
Einstein I could pass the test yeah and
 
05:17:29.868 --> 05:17:29.878 align:start position:0%
I look at it like I think I'm hurting
 
05:17:32.670 --> 05:17:32.680 align:start position:0%
the 20% people that that passed the test
 
05:17:34.510 --> 05:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
right uh by this law because they're
 
05:17:36.750 --> 05:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
going to say wait a minute I passed it
 
05:17:38.910 --> 05:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
and now I wouldn't have been able to
 
05:17:40.510 --> 05:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
pass it because I got to work for two
 
05:17:42.708 --> 05:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
years right so I'm I'm just trying to
 
05:17:44.868 --> 05:17:44.878 align:start position:0%
figure is there a way to mesh the two
 
05:17:46.430 --> 05:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
together so those
 
05:17:50.230 --> 05:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
20% don't get pushed out that's all it's
 
05:17:51.708 --> 05:17:51.718 align:start position:0%
it's an excellent point and I think the
 
05:17:54.830 --> 05:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
the idea of of you know introducing a
 
05:17:57.548 --> 05:17:57.558 align:start position:0%
you know one year or equivalent or
 
05:17:59.788 --> 05:17:59.798 align:start position:0%
twoyear or equivalent could satisfy that
 
05:18:00.948 --> 05:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
because let's say you have someone who
 
05:18:02.230 --> 05:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
has their professional engineering
 
05:18:02.240 --> 05:18:03.548 align:start position:0%
has their professional engineering
license

05:18:03.548 --> 05:18:03.558 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:18:06.948 --> 05:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
or um you know work you know worked in
 
05:18:09.030 --> 05:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
the um Construction Division of the
 
05:18:11.150 --> 05:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
military or something like that you know
 
05:18:14.350 --> 05:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
has you know some clear way of
 
05:18:16.670 --> 05:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
demonstrating you know that they have
 
05:18:18.190 --> 05:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
the background you know and that could
 
05:18:20.910 --> 05:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
be fleshed out in rule good thank
 
05:18:30.310 --> 05:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:30.320 --> 05:18:35.350 align:start position:0%
 
Dy

05:18:35.350 --> 05:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:38.030 --> 05:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
um don't good question I don't have the
 
05:18:40.628 --> 05:18:40.638 align:start position:0%
exact number but it's not a lot
 
05:18:42.230 --> 05:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes it takes people two or three
 
05:18:44.110 --> 05:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
times to
 
05:18:46.670 --> 05:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
pass and I I don't I don't know exactly
 
05:18:50.750 --> 05:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
the number but it's it is not um there
 
05:18:52.510 --> 05:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
people are having trouble with this
 
05:18:56.430 --> 05:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
because they not because they you know
 
05:18:58.708 --> 05:18:58.718 align:start position:0%
uh well because they're really missing
 
05:19:02.310 --> 05:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
some foundational knowledge and um we
 
05:19:05.910 --> 05:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
have tried to be fair with this exam and
 
05:19:09.390 --> 05:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
uh keep it consistent over time and that
 
05:19:11.750 --> 05:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
um makes it hard for us to like go over
 
05:19:13.868 --> 05:19:13.878 align:start position:0%
the test with them and say you know the
 
05:19:15.590 --> 05:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
answer to this one is really you know
 
05:19:21.030 --> 05:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
two because then it's you know uh it's
 
05:19:23.310 --> 05:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
hard to keep that you know uh
 
05:19:25.548 --> 05:19:25.558 align:start position:0%
confidential so that the information is
 
05:19:27.868 --> 05:19:27.878 align:start position:0%
not used from the next exam so we try
 
05:19:29.868 --> 05:19:29.878 align:start position:0%
and communicate the principles to them
 
05:19:31.788 --> 05:19:31.798 align:start position:0%
but we're also not a you know we don't
 
05:19:34.510 --> 05:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
have this capacity to to put a big
 
05:19:37.430 --> 05:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
training program on so we will talk with
 
05:19:39.110 --> 05:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
people we'll say these are the areas
 
05:19:41.310 --> 05:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
where you're needing help we'll try to
 
05:19:43.548 --> 05:19:43.558 align:start position:0%
explain those areas but it's
 
05:19:46.910 --> 05:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
not getting you know it's not enough for
 
05:19:49.470 --> 05:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
you know in some cases for them to to
 
05:19:52.270 --> 05:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
you know get over the the
 
05:20:00.150 --> 05:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:00.160 --> 05:20:07.430 align:start position:0%
 
many

05:20:07.430 --> 05:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:10.990 --> 05:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
um excellent question I do not know um
 
05:20:13.070 --> 05:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
we haven't been keeping that demographic
 
05:20:16.948 --> 05:20:16.958 align:start position:0%
information um I I you I don't want to
 
05:20:19.628 --> 05:20:19.638 align:start position:0%
speculate but it is
 
05:20:22.910 --> 05:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
um it you know it's it's tip actually I
 
05:20:27.390 --> 05:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:32.868 --> 05:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
know anyone else have any questions Rob
 
05:20:32.878 --> 05:20:34.670 align:start position:0%
know anyone else have any questions Rob
seeing

05:20:34.670 --> 05:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
05:20:36.948 --> 05:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
n seeing none thank you very much all
 
05:20:42.110 --> 05:20:42.120 align:start position:0%

wonderful job commission there he um so
 
05:20:58.868 --> 05:20:58.878 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm a practitioner I'm in the field
 
05:21:02.910 --> 05:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
uh 30 years installer like 28 years as a
 
05:21:06.990 --> 05:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
septic designer uh my formal business is
 
05:21:07.000 --> 05:21:07.990 align:start position:0%
septic designer uh my formal business is
uh

05:21:07.990 --> 05:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:21:11.510 --> 05:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
excavation uh I have mentioned uh my two
 
05:21:12.788 --> 05:21:12.798 align:start position:0%
sons in the
 
05:21:15.590 --> 05:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
business uh when I started out wanting
 
05:21:18.910 --> 05:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
to get into this business uh 30 years
 
05:21:22.110 --> 05:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
ago uh there was one community college
 
05:21:25.390 --> 05:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
class because I had no idea what soil
 
05:21:27.230 --> 05:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
was other than digging it I probably
 
05:21:30.070 --> 05:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
called it dirt like everybody else so I
 
05:21:32.110 --> 05:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
seek out where where could I go take a
 
05:21:34.070 --> 05:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
class to learn this in Community College
 
05:21:35.830 --> 05:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
had a class that I traveled all the way
 
05:21:39.548 --> 05:21:39.558 align:start position:0%
up to Berlin for um and then I figured
 
05:21:41.430 --> 05:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
boy I knew everything and jumped into
 
05:21:43.830 --> 05:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
the class and and failed
 
05:21:49.150 --> 05:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
it um my sons um still both started out
 
05:21:51.868 --> 05:21:51.878 align:start position:0%
in a college career I never wanted to be
 
05:21:53.628 --> 05:21:53.638 align:start position:0%
part of the family business never wanted
 
05:21:55.788 --> 05:21:55.798 align:start position:0%
to have employees equipment everything
 
05:22:01.270 --> 05:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
else all came back to home and um we're
 
05:22:04.030 --> 05:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
essentially tutored or trained by myself
 
05:22:07.948 --> 05:22:07.958 align:start position:0%
in both trades I've also had a foreman
 
05:22:11.030 --> 05:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's been with me 20 plus years who
 
05:22:13.548 --> 05:22:13.558 align:start position:0%
oversees a lot of my site construction
 
05:22:16.150 --> 05:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
as I'm going there's very little
 
05:22:18.030 --> 05:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
05:22:23.868 --> 05:22:23.878 align:start position:0%
learn um I have my license is uh number
 
05:22:29.350 --> 05:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
1235 I believe my sons are in the 3000s
 
05:22:32.230 --> 05:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
their licens number but with all those
 
05:22:35.750 --> 05:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
people in the business only 150 or so
 
05:22:38.910 --> 05:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
are actually active designers on the
 
05:22:42.150 --> 05:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
installer side it it's it's it's a few
 
05:22:45.270 --> 05:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
hundred and the the point of Aging out
 
05:22:46.948 --> 05:22:46.958 align:start position:0%
is exactly what's happening whether
 
05:22:50.110 --> 05:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
you're a carpenter or anything else so
 
05:22:53.310 --> 05:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
when when they brought this to me um and
 
05:22:56.070 --> 05:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
I forgot to mention how I gained my
 
05:22:58.110 --> 05:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
background information be able to pick
 
05:23:01.150 --> 05:23:01.160 align:start position:0%
up the Mel book and see what color it is
 
05:23:03.430 --> 05:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
and to feel the texture of a sand and so
 
05:23:06.830 --> 05:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
forth was from a 30 Old designer in town
 
05:23:09.750 --> 05:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
who took a liking to me and showed me
 
05:23:12.390 --> 05:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
what I needed came back in took the test
 
05:23:17.350 --> 05:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
the next year and I passed so
 
05:23:21.628 --> 05:23:21.638 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the Rush by young people
 
05:23:23.708 --> 05:23:23.718 align:start position:0%
it's young people wanting to be
 
05:23:26.470 --> 05:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
installers or designers especially
 
05:23:28.270 --> 05:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
installers I can tell you from being in
 
05:23:31.110 --> 05:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
the trades and having friends with 10
 
05:23:34.110 --> 05:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
other companies in my area uh the kid
 
05:23:35.830 --> 05:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
that comes to work for you that year and
 
05:23:38.070 --> 05:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
learns how to used to be backos now it's
 
05:23:40.750 --> 05:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
excavators so I get pretty handy and I
 
05:23:42.708 --> 05:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
go out there and I lay out a system and
 
05:23:45.150 --> 05:23:45.160 align:start position:0%
gez my boss ain't the smartest guy in
 
05:23:46.948 --> 05:23:46.958 align:start position:0%
the world I should be able to do it
 
05:23:48.708 --> 05:23:48.718 align:start position:0%
they're flooding the system they're all
 
05:23:51.590 --> 05:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
coming in trying to take this test and
 
05:23:53.510 --> 05:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
and I have so many people that will call
 
05:23:55.230 --> 05:23:55.240 align:start position:0%
me and say to me representative how do I
 
05:23:56.750 --> 05:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
get to the front of the line to take
 
05:23:59.430 --> 05:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
this test and I keep being told by the
 
05:24:01.830 --> 05:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
department that there are so many people
 
05:24:03.948 --> 05:24:03.958 align:start position:0%
in the queue it's hard to get more
 
05:24:08.510 --> 05:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
people in to take the test so I as a
 
05:24:12.190 --> 05:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
practitioner um understand and we have
 
05:24:15.910 --> 05:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
had a couple three people that um were
 
05:24:18.190 --> 05:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
talented that have come to us and we're
 
05:24:20.510 --> 05:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
sort of doing this sort of thing now at
 
05:24:23.470 --> 05:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
least I have a couple people and and I
 
05:24:26.868 --> 05:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
think there I know that there are
 
05:24:30.430 --> 05:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
other men and women that are in this age
 
05:24:32.868 --> 05:24:32.878 align:start position:0%
group group of me that want to work with
 
05:24:36.190 --> 05:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
other people so I I I believe in what
 
05:24:38.548 --> 05:24:38.558 align:start position:0%
they're trying to do and I I think it
 
05:24:40.750 --> 05:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
will get more
 
05:24:42.948 --> 05:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
people well we like to call them
 
05:24:46.110 --> 05:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
licensed but permitted in the state and
 
05:24:49.110 --> 05:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh if the department Can U work out or
 
05:24:51.548 --> 05:24:51.558 align:start position:0%
this this committee can work out some
 
05:24:54.230 --> 05:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
amendment I would I'd be in favor as a
 
05:24:58.190 --> 05:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:02.230 --> 05:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative Donald
 
05:25:03.510 --> 05:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:25:07.270 --> 05:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
question um from the this to me sounds
 
05:25:09.430 --> 05:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
very similar to an electrician type of
 
05:25:10.750 --> 05:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
environment where you have Journeymen
 
05:25:13.230 --> 05:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
and you have the this type of uh you
 
05:25:16.510 --> 05:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
know training uh from your experience
 
05:25:20.230 --> 05:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
what is the pay grade that you would get
 
05:25:21.670 --> 05:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
that you may go through do you do you
 
05:25:24.310 --> 05:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
have like different grades for payment
 
05:25:26.310 --> 05:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
because you have someone who's been
 
05:25:28.350 --> 05:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
licensed and trained what's the
 
05:25:32.708 --> 05:25:32.718 align:start position:0%
incentive you do as a business owner for
 
05:25:35.470 --> 05:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
someone to be doing designs and so forth
 
05:25:46.310 --> 05:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:50.510 --> 05:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
exam tell me again that's okay um what
 
05:25:53.750 --> 05:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
is there an incentive for uh your
 
05:25:57.190 --> 05:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
employees to say I would like to have
 
05:26:00.868 --> 05:26:00.878 align:start position:0%
them you know pass the exam and just is
 
05:26:03.150 --> 05:26:03.160 align:start position:0%
like just with like an electrician you
 
05:26:04.708 --> 05:26:04.718 align:start position:0%
have a journeyman and then when they
 
05:26:07.270 --> 05:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
pass they actually get an A bump up okay
 
05:26:09.868 --> 05:26:09.878 align:start position:0%
in their pay is does that do you see
 
05:26:11.590 --> 05:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
that in the industry do you see the same
 
05:26:13.430 --> 05:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
type of environment this same type of
 
05:26:16.948 --> 05:26:16.958 align:start position:0%
environment here with the septic design
 
05:26:20.110 --> 05:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
and also with the installers where after
 
05:26:22.628 --> 05:26:22.638 align:start position:0%
they pass the exam then there would get
 
05:26:24.708 --> 05:26:24.718 align:start position:0%
and the incentive is they get a bump up
 
05:26:27.868 --> 05:26:27.878 align:start position:0%
in pay grade okay I I think the
 
05:26:31.350 --> 05:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
incentive is that um
 
05:26:34.230 --> 05:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
these people that will Apprentice under
 
05:26:36.150 --> 05:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
under our company or any other company
 
05:26:37.990 --> 05:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
are going to learn to trade we're we're
 
05:26:39.910 --> 05:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
going to get as an apprentice they're
 
05:26:41.750 --> 05:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
going to be paid an hourly rate like a
 
05:26:43.990 --> 05:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
laborer would be but we're we're going
 
05:26:46.750 --> 05:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
to spend more time I fully anticipate
 
05:26:48.948 --> 05:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
almost everyone that comes to us wanting
 
05:26:50.590 --> 05:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
to do that is going to leave us and go
 
05:26:51.510 --> 05:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
on their
 
05:26:54.708 --> 05:26:54.718 align:start position:0%
own most most septic designers are
 
05:26:57.070 --> 05:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
oneman bands unless you're working for
 
05:27:01.750 --> 05:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
an engineering firm uh so and in are are
 
05:27:04.990 --> 05:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
you know a couple people a l a lot of uh
 
05:27:06.708 --> 05:27:06.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of the young installers that are
 
05:27:08.110 --> 05:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
coming into the business I have a
 
05:27:10.670 --> 05:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
son-in-law and some others um they've
 
05:27:13.390 --> 05:27:13.400 align:start position:0%
worked for other companies uh they want
 
05:27:14.910 --> 05:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
that permit in their hand and they go
 
05:27:19.830 --> 05:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
out that helps you I would uh I I we pay
 
05:27:21.628 --> 05:27:21.638 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned a generous rate
 
05:27:24.310 --> 05:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
for anyone that's working with us uh
 
05:27:27.110 --> 05:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
whether you're conven we own convenience
 
05:27:30.830 --> 05:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
store too but um they're they looking
 
05:27:33.430 --> 05:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
for a path to get them forward when
 
05:27:35.430 --> 05:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
they're coming to us and I don't see
 
05:27:38.948 --> 05:27:38.958 align:start position:0%
them being with us 40 hours a week I see
 
05:27:41.788 --> 05:27:41.798 align:start position:0%
that we have a job that comes into the
 
05:27:44.270 --> 05:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
queue um we're going to go out onto the
 
05:27:45.788 --> 05:27:45.798 align:start position:0%
site we're going to teach them how to
 
05:27:49.150 --> 05:27:49.160 align:start position:0%
use survey equipment uh feel for the
 
05:27:50.708 --> 05:27:50.718 align:start position:0%
land but they're only going to be with
 
05:27:54.708 --> 05:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
us maybe 8 10 hours a week I would think
 
05:27:57.350 --> 05:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
on a couple active jobs designers will
 
05:27:59.948 --> 05:27:59.958 align:start position:0%
spend more time because then uh some
 
05:28:02.548 --> 05:28:02.558 align:start position:0%
computer training but what what Mr
 
05:28:05.868 --> 05:28:05.878 align:start position:0%
throwbridge brought up is so true when I
 
05:28:07.788 --> 05:28:07.798 align:start position:0%
started in on this business everything
 
05:28:10.948 --> 05:28:10.958 align:start position:0%
was hand drafting so you had you had
 
05:28:13.670 --> 05:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
your folder out there and the pipes got
 
05:28:15.868 --> 05:28:15.878 align:start position:0%
to be 50 feet and I got to scale it out
 
05:28:18.868 --> 05:28:18.878 align:start position:0%
and I put it down and I look at it and I
 
05:28:21.430 --> 05:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
have to put a 90 in which is a coupling
 
05:28:25.310 --> 05:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
or or a a sweep tier whatever it is you
 
05:28:26.830 --> 05:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
had this working knowledge because
 
05:28:29.590 --> 05:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
you're drawing it the whole time now for
 
05:28:31.830 --> 05:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
a couple thousand you buy a computer
 
05:28:34.350 --> 05:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
program which is what the guys are doing
 
05:28:36.430 --> 05:28:36.440 align:start position:0%
and all the information's already loaded
 
05:28:37.708 --> 05:28:37.718 align:start position:0%
in there I'm going to do a stone and
 
05:28:40.150 --> 05:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
pipe field and it draws everything for
 
05:28:42.070 --> 05:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
you you almost have to work you have to
 
05:28:46.788 --> 05:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:46.798 --> 05:28:50.750 align:start position:0%
 
backwards

05:28:50.750 --> 05:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:50.760 --> 05:28:52.628 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:28:52.628 --> 05:28:52.638 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:28:56.150 --> 05:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
no representative Derby was next then
 
05:28:56.160 --> 05:28:58.590 align:start position:0%
no representative Derby was next then
representative

05:28:58.590 --> 05:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:29:01.110 --> 05:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
M okay thank you Mr thank you for taking
 
05:29:05.708 --> 05:29:05.718 align:start position:0%
my question um I'm sure I'm sure I'm um
 
05:29:08.430 --> 05:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not totally understanding that it it
 
05:29:10.548 --> 05:29:10.558 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be um obviously you're not
 
05:29:15.110 --> 05:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
trying to get to to keep people employed
 
05:29:18.390 --> 05:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
um longer by forcing them by having this
 
05:29:21.390 --> 05:29:21.400 align:start position:0%
two this two-year period um you you
 
05:29:23.230 --> 05:29:23.240 align:start position:0%
think that it would be a benefit to your
 
05:29:28.150 --> 05:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
organization too um so can you just um I
 
05:29:30.390 --> 05:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
just don't want to misinterpret the the
 
05:29:33.628 --> 05:29:33.638 align:start position:0%
the last response to um representative
 
05:29:36.310 --> 05:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
donal's question about um PE when when
 
05:29:38.270 --> 05:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
you responded and said oh people would
 
05:29:39.948 --> 05:29:39.958 align:start position:0%
leave as soon as they get this that
 
05:29:41.390 --> 05:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
makes it sound like oh I don't want them
 
05:29:43.590 --> 05:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
to leave so I'm gonna so you know I want
 
05:29:45.830 --> 05:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
them to keep stay for two years so
 
05:29:48.548 --> 05:29:48.558 align:start position:0%
what's the benefit to you for um for the
 
05:29:51.708 --> 05:29:51.718 align:start position:0%
two-year um you know training period
 
05:29:54.310 --> 05:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
well while they're with me I'm I'm
 
05:29:58.708 --> 05:29:58.718 align:start position:0%
gaining um instead of um with a we're
 
05:30:00.868 --> 05:30:00.878 align:start position:0%
two designers right now
 
05:30:03.070 --> 05:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
uh instead of my being able to put out
 
05:30:05.190 --> 05:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
three or four designs a week by having
 
05:30:06.868 --> 05:30:06.878 align:start position:0%
someone there in training and getting
 
05:30:09.910 --> 05:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
them up to speed I'll increase my
 
05:30:12.070 --> 05:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
productivity and that's more income
 
05:30:15.670 --> 05:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
coming in and I can pay more money out
 
05:30:17.670 --> 05:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh I just I
 
05:30:22.230 --> 05:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
don't this B so over 70% of all the SE
 
05:30:24.510 --> 05:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
of all the property owners in our state
 
05:30:27.750 --> 05:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
are on a private septic system um so
 
05:30:29.948 --> 05:30:29.958 align:start position:0%
there's a need always of more designs
 
05:30:32.948 --> 05:30:32.958 align:start position:0%
and more installs but I certainly don't
 
05:30:35.110 --> 05:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
need 10 more people working for me
 
05:30:38.868 --> 05:30:38.878 align:start position:0%
either so I see it as it's a
 
05:30:41.110 --> 05:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
payforward and the engineering firms
 
05:30:43.190 --> 05:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
would probably be more excited about it
 
05:30:45.110 --> 05:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
because for them that would be a Growing
 
05:30:49.150 --> 05:30:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:52.470 --> 05:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
them l representa l montain and
 
05:30:52.480 --> 05:30:54.750 align:start position:0%
them l representa l montain and
representative

05:30:54.750 --> 05:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:30:57.910 --> 05:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
Oran thank you for taking my questions
 
05:31:00.350 --> 05:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
um just what I understand is your do you
 
05:31:02.030 --> 05:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
have a separate company that does the
 
05:31:04.230 --> 05:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
design and and a different company does
 
05:31:06.868 --> 05:31:06.878 align:start position:0%
the install it's one company it's one
 
05:31:08.830 --> 05:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
company we're a small family business my
 
05:31:11.990 --> 05:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
daughter runs the office and four desks
 
05:31:14.830 --> 05:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
like this and yeah we we do we are
 
05:31:19.230 --> 05:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
licensed designers installers and septic
 
05:31:21.470 --> 05:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
evaluators okay that's what we're we're
 
05:31:23.708 --> 05:31:23.718 align:start position:0%
F we call ourselves a family septic
 
05:31:26.350 --> 05:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
business I guess my my question though
 
05:31:30.670 --> 05:31:30.680 align:start position:0%
when you said that if you have a sort of
 
05:31:33.390 --> 05:31:33.400 align:start position:0%
an apprentice designer working through
 
05:31:35.868 --> 05:31:35.878 align:start position:0%
this you you would only be able to use
 
05:31:38.430 --> 05:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
them for 10 eight to 10 hours a
 
05:31:40.628 --> 05:31:40.638 align:start position:0%
week they wouldn't be able to work
 
05:31:43.030 --> 05:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
fulltime for you then unless they
 
05:31:45.350 --> 05:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps were also involved in the
 
05:31:48.548 --> 05:31:48.558 align:start position:0%
installing bu is that the idea well they
 
05:31:51.548 --> 05:31:51.558 align:start position:0%
they could be they could be a laborer um
 
05:31:54.590 --> 05:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm just saying that uh they're
 
05:31:56.430 --> 05:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
going to be gainfully employed but
 
05:31:59.390 --> 05:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
they're they're going to need to do if
 
05:32:01.470 --> 05:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
if they're only skill they're looking to
 
05:32:04.430 --> 05:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
learn is to advance her knowledge on
 
05:32:07.750 --> 05:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
septic design or install there's only so
 
05:32:09.708 --> 05:32:09.718 align:start position:0%
many hours in a week we're doing that
 
05:32:12.788 --> 05:32:12.798 align:start position:0%
work does that does that help you at all
 
05:32:16.190 --> 05:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
um yes okay thank
 
05:32:19.190 --> 05:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
you representative hgan for a
 
05:32:21.948 --> 05:32:21.958 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thanks
 
05:32:24.788 --> 05:32:24.798 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm just curious
 
05:32:26.510 --> 05:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with uh professional
 
05:32:28.548 --> 05:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
organizations or retired professionals
 
05:32:30.110 --> 05:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
that have gotten together in the form of
 
05:32:31.910 --> 05:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
a group and offered training to
 
05:32:31.920 --> 05:32:33.070 align:start position:0%
a group and offered training to
individuals

05:32:33.070 --> 05:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
05:32:36.270 --> 05:32:36.280 align:start position:0%
to get them up and coming have you
 
05:32:39.590 --> 05:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
considered people in the in your field
 
05:32:41.750 --> 05:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh other companies and people you're
 
05:32:43.150 --> 05:32:43.160 align:start position:0%
acquainted with that have the same
 
05:32:46.788 --> 05:32:46.798 align:start position:0%
Talent getting together and uh assisting
 
05:32:48.708 --> 05:32:48.718 align:start position:0%
Dees in providing training that they're
 
05:32:51.910 --> 05:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
unable to provide and sort of mentoring
 
05:32:53.990 --> 05:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
people through a classroom or some other
 
05:32:56.628 --> 05:32:56.638 align:start position:0%
program that help educate a larger
 
05:32:57.548 --> 05:32:57.558 align:start position:0%
number of
 
05:32:59.670 --> 05:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
individuals thank you for thank for the
 
05:32:59.680 --> 05:33:00.830 align:start position:0%
individuals thank you for thank for the
question

05:33:00.830 --> 05:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:33:03.310 --> 05:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's big thinking that's a
 
05:33:05.948 --> 05:33:05.958 align:start position:0%
that's a wonderful thought um I'm not
 
05:33:09.948 --> 05:33:09.958 align:start position:0%
opposed to that um what happens many
 
05:33:12.868 --> 05:33:12.878 align:start position:0%
times when
 
05:33:15.830 --> 05:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
um Excavating
 
05:33:15.840 --> 05:33:18.150 align:start position:0%
um Excavating
owners

05:33:18.150 --> 05:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
owners
 
05:33:21.910 --> 05:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
um finish doing what they're doing uh
 
05:33:25.310 --> 05:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
there's a most of them retire and go to
 
05:33:29.628 --> 05:33:29.638 align:start position:0%
Florida or or as I as I say to my family
 
05:33:31.788 --> 05:33:31.798 align:start position:0%
you'll find me either slumped over my
 
05:33:36.510 --> 05:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
excavator or sitting at my desk so um
 
05:33:39.510 --> 05:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
there's um because I just enjoy work and
 
05:33:42.470 --> 05:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
and so many others do so it it's it's a
 
05:33:42.480 --> 05:33:43.708 align:start position:0%
and so many others do so it it's it's a
unique

05:33:43.708 --> 05:33:43.718 align:start position:0%
unique
 
05:33:47.788 --> 05:33:47.798 align:start position:0%
profession so yes I I love the idea but
 
05:33:49.110 --> 05:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
they'd have to give me one of those
 
05:33:54.868 --> 05:33:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:57.628 --> 05:33:57.638 align:start position:0%
they anyone question anyone else
 
05:34:00.270 --> 05:34:00.280 align:start position:0%
representative Ron thank thank you Mr
 
05:34:01.470 --> 05:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:34:03.830 --> 05:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
question I'm curious what it what would
 
05:34:07.990 --> 05:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
a starting pay be for a septic um
 
05:34:11.270 --> 05:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
installer and a designer I'm just trying
 
05:34:13.910 --> 05:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
to think of the incentive for someone to
 
05:34:15.670 --> 05:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
go in the field like if they're working
 
05:34:19.350 --> 05:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
for you but they're not licensed how you
 
05:34:21.150 --> 05:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
know is is that going to be a big bump
 
05:34:22.470 --> 05:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
up for
 
05:34:25.430 --> 05:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
them um I think M throwbridge had
 
05:34:27.390 --> 05:34:27.400 align:start position:0%
brought up the point on how much money
 
05:34:31.310 --> 05:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
could a uh could a uh um homeowners save
 
05:34:33.230 --> 05:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
by doing their own install and it's
 
05:34:34.788 --> 05:34:34.798 align:start position:0%
thousands of
 
05:34:39.350 --> 05:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
dollars um the septic design
 
05:34:43.150 --> 05:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
um the septic design is no less than a
 
05:34:45.310 --> 05:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
couple thousand dollars to something
 
05:34:48.350 --> 05:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
more complicated to be
 
05:34:52.230 --> 05:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
4500 and uh engineering firms charge
 
05:34:55.430 --> 05:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
even more money than that there
 
05:34:58.070 --> 05:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
there's someone that is good at their
 
05:35:02.390 --> 05:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
trade it's um it's a fine trade to be
 
05:35:07.548 --> 05:35:07.558 align:start position:0%
in for a followup Mr chair um so when I
 
05:35:09.830 --> 05:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
when I look at the the section on septic
 
05:35:11.670 --> 05:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
system installers and the section on
 
05:35:15.708 --> 05:35:15.718 align:start position:0%
septic system designer if someone is you
 
05:35:19.270 --> 05:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
know spending that year um you know
 
05:35:23.430 --> 05:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
working with a a licensed installer does
 
05:35:25.510 --> 05:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
that is there some Synergy there if they
 
05:35:27.230 --> 05:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to be a designer like will they
 
05:35:30.190 --> 05:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
learn kind of aspects of design at the
 
05:35:32.190 --> 05:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
at the same time and vice
 
05:35:34.708 --> 05:35:34.718 align:start position:0%
versa because they're not really I I I
 
05:35:37.430 --> 05:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
guess my question is are they too really
 
05:35:39.708 --> 05:35:39.718 align:start position:0%
segregated professions or are there
 
05:35:41.590 --> 05:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities where the the skills and
 
05:35:45.948 --> 05:35:45.958 align:start position:0%
knowledge overlap okay good point so um
 
05:35:47.948 --> 05:35:47.958 align:start position:0%
when I first came into the industry
 
05:35:51.270 --> 05:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
there were very few designer and also
 
05:35:54.708 --> 05:35:54.718 align:start position:0%
permitted installers I I was
 
05:35:58.190 --> 05:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
rare um and I think still the two
 
05:36:01.470 --> 05:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
professions two Prof professions are are
 
05:36:04.670 --> 05:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
separated by quite a bit but you can't
 
05:36:07.390 --> 05:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
you can't truly be a good designer
 
05:36:09.470 --> 05:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
unless you understand how the installs
 
05:36:12.310 --> 05:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
going together there's there are so many
 
05:36:15.110 --> 05:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
times I can hear it from installers that
 
05:36:18.868 --> 05:36:18.878 align:start position:0%
they have um a company that will Design
 
05:36:20.670 --> 05:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
things that you just can never build
 
05:36:22.868 --> 05:36:22.878 align:start position:0%
they're not taking into they're not
 
05:36:26.270 --> 05:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
taking into consideration slope and rise
 
05:36:29.670 --> 05:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
and everything else so I I think I think
 
05:36:32.670 --> 05:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
having the background in both U helps
 
05:36:35.150 --> 05:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
not it doesn't help an installer so much
 
05:36:37.830 --> 05:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
to know about the designer's business
 
05:36:40.230 --> 05:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
but the designer that knows about how to
 
05:36:43.708 --> 05:36:43.718 align:start position:0%
install a septic is is a much closer
 
05:36:49.150 --> 05:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:52.990 --> 05:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
test representative bail and
 
05:36:55.590 --> 05:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:36:58.150 --> 05:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative for taking my question
 
05:37:00.430 --> 05:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
I just was looking at the bottom line on
 
05:37:02.670 --> 05:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
the bill the the literal last line which
 
05:37:06.708 --> 05:37:06.718 align:start position:0%
is the 60 days after it passage do you
 
05:37:09.990 --> 05:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
think that's enough time um where I'm
 
05:37:13.990 --> 05:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
coming from is that so this is we're
 
05:37:16.350 --> 05:37:16.360 align:start position:0%
going to
 
05:37:19.390 --> 05:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
have as representative harb
 
05:37:23.948 --> 05:37:23.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned people who got licensed that
 
05:37:26.948 --> 05:37:26.958 align:start position:0%
didn't do the two years all the way on
 
05:37:30.788 --> 05:37:30.798 align:start position:0%
to um people who really really need to
 
05:37:34.670 --> 05:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
do the whole entire two years is 60 days
 
05:37:38.350 --> 05:37:38.360 align:start position:0%
to enact this this um legislation enough
 
05:37:40.788 --> 05:37:40.798 align:start position:0%
time to make that transfer is my
 
05:37:42.750 --> 05:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
question is that thank you
 
05:37:44.430 --> 05:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
representative for the question it might
 
05:37:48.548 --> 05:37:48.558 align:start position:0%
be better suited to u to the department
 
05:37:52.230 --> 05:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
and whether rules need to be um to
 
05:37:55.510 --> 05:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
address that issue but as we all know
 
05:37:57.150 --> 05:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
let's say this thing flies through the
 
05:37:58.788 --> 05:37:58.798 align:start position:0%
house goes to the Senate the governor
 
05:38:00.590 --> 05:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
isn't going to turn it out
 
05:38:04.350 --> 05:38:04.360 align:start position:0%
till June or later uh which brings them
 
05:38:06.430 --> 05:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
into the next cycle people have already
 
05:38:09.948 --> 05:38:09.958 align:start position:0%
taken the next spring test um I I
 
05:38:12.390 --> 05:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
foresee that anybody that passes the
 
05:38:15.628 --> 05:38:15.638 align:start position:0%
test um up until that time does isn't
 
05:38:18.628 --> 05:38:18.638 align:start position:0%
required to do any additional
 
05:38:21.230 --> 05:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
apprenticing and so forth but I would
 
05:38:23.628 --> 05:38:23.638 align:start position:0%
leave it to the department to uh
 
05:38:26.948 --> 05:38:26.958 align:start position:0%
consider rules and I'm not one that that
 
05:38:28.590 --> 05:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
will say to the Department of
 
05:38:30.270 --> 05:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services say I want you to
 
05:38:33.230 --> 05:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
write rules but I'm I'm going to tell
 
05:38:35.430 --> 05:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
you and the chairman will know this I
 
05:38:38.430 --> 05:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
have I have full faith and trust in in
 
05:38:41.310 --> 05:38:41.320 align:start position:0%
this Branch subsurface to do the right
 
05:38:43.070 --> 05:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
thing I really
 
05:38:46.070 --> 05:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
do representative
 
05:38:48.350 --> 05:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
Simpson thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:38:50.430 --> 05:38:50.440 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
05:38:52.628 --> 05:38:52.638 align:start position:0%
and I probably should have asked this to
 
05:38:55.350 --> 05:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
Mr trobridge earlier so apologies but I
 
05:38:58.150 --> 05:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
was just trying to fit together the um
 
05:39:00.110 --> 05:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
how this will work in my brain and just
 
05:39:04.868 --> 05:39:04.878 align:start position:0%
wondered if um is there a way that uh
 
05:39:06.990 --> 05:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
the connections like a easy way that the
 
05:39:08.868 --> 05:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
connections will be made with folks who
 
05:39:11.390 --> 05:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
want to enter the field and those of you
 
05:39:13.468 --> 05:39:13.478 align:start position:0%
who are working in this design and
 
05:39:16.628 --> 05:39:16.638 align:start position:0%
install business um will the department
 
05:39:18.750 --> 05:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
be able to refer will have a list and
 
05:39:22.110 --> 05:39:22.120 align:start position:0%
kind of refer people to to um
 
05:39:24.230 --> 05:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
practitioners in the field who are
 
05:39:26.030 --> 05:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
interested you know when they sign up
 
05:39:28.350 --> 05:39:28.360 align:start position:0%
for the test or I just wondered if you
 
05:39:30.190 --> 05:39:30.200 align:start position:0%
could talk a minute about that yeah if
 
05:39:32.868 --> 05:39:32.878 align:start position:0%
if I understand the question so there is
 
05:39:36.390 --> 05:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
a Statewide organization it's had a name
 
05:39:38.270 --> 05:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
change used to be the granted State
 
05:39:41.628 --> 05:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
installers and designers uh very well
 
05:39:44.190 --> 05:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
membershi uh there's there's a a name
 
05:39:44.200 --> 05:39:47.830 align:start position:0%
membershi uh there's there's a a name
difference

05:39:47.830 --> 05:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:50.590 --> 05:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
now so there's a resource and they're
 
05:39:52.670 --> 05:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
they're doing uh they're doing training
 
05:39:56.708 --> 05:39:56.718 align:start position:0%
for uh septic evaluators also the
 
05:39:59.110 --> 05:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
website anyone that goes to Department
 
05:39:59.120 --> 05:39:59.910 align:start position:0%
website anyone that goes to Department
envirment

05:39:59.910 --> 05:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
envirment
 
05:40:02.628 --> 05:40:02.638 align:start position:0%
Services a subsurface brings you right
 
05:40:07.070 --> 05:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
on to a a great website uh that's then
 
05:40:09.990 --> 05:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
you click on uh designs construction
 
05:40:12.990 --> 05:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
approvals or whatever and there complete
 
05:40:14.750 --> 05:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
listing of all the people that have
 
05:40:18.510 --> 05:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
current permits and licenses permits for
 
05:40:21.788 --> 05:40:21.798 align:start position:0%
designs and installs uh all show up
 
05:40:24.150 --> 05:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
there so I have faith that they that the
 
05:40:25.788 --> 05:40:25.798 align:start position:0%
department could make that connection
 
05:40:28.990 --> 05:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
there there is tremendous frustration by
 
05:40:31.910 --> 05:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
the people that take the test and fail
 
05:40:34.868 --> 05:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
tremendous and I I live in a small town
 
05:40:37.948 --> 05:40:37.958 align:start position:0%
I own a convenience store everyone knows
 
05:40:41.190 --> 05:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
one contractor for another and how can I
 
05:40:44.150 --> 05:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
get there they're frustrated and I until
 
05:40:46.548 --> 05:40:46.558 align:start position:0%
I heard the department say you know we
 
05:40:48.750 --> 05:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
can't say you got you know question a
 
05:40:50.670 --> 05:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
wrong you know I I understand that
 
05:40:53.270 --> 05:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
reason so I I think they're trying to
 
05:40:58.230 --> 05:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:01.468 --> 05:41:01.478 align:start position:0%
permit anyone else for
 
05:41:05.430 --> 05:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
05:41:09.468 --> 05:41:09.478 align:start position:0%
much yes I think
 
05:41:13.670 --> 05:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
you I think we are
 
05:41:16.948 --> 05:41:16.958 align:start position:0%
right uh
 
05:41:22.948 --> 05:41:22.958 align:start position:0%
seeing well we we are done uh do we want
 
05:41:28.230 --> 05:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
to talk about uh which one
 
05:41:28.240 --> 05:41:30.548 align:start position:0%
to talk about uh which one
141

05:41:30.548 --> 05:41:30.558 align:start position:0%
141
 
05:41:35.110 --> 05:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh was it was it 141 141
 
05:41:39.948 --> 05:41:39.958 align:start position:0%
141 uh question is do we want to
 
05:41:42.708 --> 05:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
uh do we want to
 
05:41:45.468 --> 05:41:45.478 align:start position:0%
execute we feel do we feel we can
 
05:41:47.390 --> 05:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
executive go into executive session and
 
05:41:50.070 --> 05:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:55.190 --> 05:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
it uh well yeah so actually the the
 
05:41:58.510 --> 05:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
decision is mine and representative

05:44:27.958 --> 05:44:45.510 align:start position:0%
 
mine

05:44:45.510 --> 05:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:48.708 --> 05:44:48.718 align:start position:0%

better we did a reset thank
 
05:44:58.190 --> 05:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
you okay um I'll speak to my motion of
 
05:44:59.788 --> 05:44:59.798 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
05:45:02.110 --> 05:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
uh for House Bill
 
05:45:05.070 --> 05:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
1141 um I believe this bill is important
 
05:45:08.510 --> 05:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
because it accounts for a change in use
 
05:45:10.708 --> 05:45:10.718 align:start position:0%
um when determining whether a septic
 
05:45:14.670 --> 05:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
system needs to um have a a change in
 
05:45:17.390 --> 05:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
its loading capacity I believe Mr
 
05:45:21.110 --> 05:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
trobridge made a good case for that um
 
05:45:24.788 --> 05:45:24.798 align:start position:0%
and also went into more about if the lot
 
05:45:27.548 --> 05:45:27.558 align:start position:0%
is 5 Acres more in size and is served by
 
05:45:29.548 --> 05:45:29.558 align:start position:0%
a se's Disposal system system that
 
05:45:31.628 --> 05:45:31.638 align:start position:0%
received construction and operational
 
05:45:34.830 --> 05:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
approval from the department so I I just
 
05:45:38.948 --> 05:45:38.958 align:start position:0%
feel like it's um going to be uh a
 
05:45:42.110 --> 05:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
nice a way of better ensuring that
 
05:45:44.868 --> 05:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
septic systems can handle their capacity
 
05:45:46.628 --> 05:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
that's coming from the dwelling and
 
05:45:48.510 --> 05:45:48.520 align:start position:0%

05:45:53.030 --> 05:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
