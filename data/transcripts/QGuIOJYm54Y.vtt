00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 align:start position:0%
11 o'clock we'll start our work session
 
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
and I will remind everybody to turn your
 
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
mics on uh because we are live streaming
 
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
we've got a little ax about that last
 
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
week excluding myself so we might kind
 
00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
of make sure the mics are on uh the
 
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
first bill we have up is House Bill 419
 
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
mass learning communities program of the
 
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
and I see Chancellor Rubenstein and
 
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
director Reed are here I'm assuming you
 
00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
want to make a comment or two
 
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
or representative lab do you want to
 
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
like sure somebody should be taking
 
00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:37.610 align:start position:0%
like sure somebody should be taking

you got a pen
 
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you sir
 
00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not exactly
 
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much represent
 
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
emmerich and members of division uh
 
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 align:start position:0%

Hampshire uh this bill is really timely
 
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the sheet I just added
 
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
to you I'll try to get through it
 
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
quickly I know you have a lot on a dock
 
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 align:start position:0%
today but math learning communities
 
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
program as a result of what we've seen
 
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
over the last if you look at the first
 
00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:52.259 align:start position:0%
in the box there are 2012 back when Paul
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
leather and Jenny Berry were at the
 
00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:58.259 align:start position:0%
department uh representative Heath is
 
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
very familiar with that as she worked
 
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
there also prior to that I
 
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
um I won't say how much prior
 
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
represented Heath but the there was a
 
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
committee form a task force look at
 
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
mathematics in our state that task force
 
00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:16.979 align:start position:0%
back then identified that we're not
 
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
accomplishing what we should be
 
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
accomplishing in mathematics that's 2012
 
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
looking at where we are today
 
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
we sometimes think well all this is a
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
result of the pandemic covid-19 it's not
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
where we have with mathematics we've had
 
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
a continual slide going in this day as
 
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
terms of our performance and Proficiency
 
00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:41.699 align:start position:0%
in mathematics
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
I've highlighted two of those box or
 
00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:46.979 align:start position:0%

2022 New Hampshire students test scores
 
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:53.300 align:start position:0%
fell during the covet pandemic
 
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
continuing a long-term decline
 
00:07:59.450 --> 00:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
the biggest decline both nationally and
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire was in our eighth grade
 
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
math according to 2022 s assessments
 
00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
taken by a sample of students 30 percent
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
of the state's 8th graders and 40
 
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
percent of our fourth graders are
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
proficient or above in mathematics
 
00:08:18.409 --> 00:08:18.419 align:start position:0%
48 percent of students proficient in
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
mathematics in 2019 and you can read on
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
when I came before a division two years
 
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
ago I handed to them a flow chart of
 
00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
tracking cohorts the same group of
 
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
students as their fifth graders 6th
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
graders 7th graders right through to
 
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
high school
 
00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:39.539 align:start position:0%
in looking at one of those courts and
 
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:40.860 align:start position:0%
I'll leave you a copy of this because
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
this is ancient history however it's
 
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:46.260 align:start position:0%
reflective exactly what you if you look
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
at I platform today which is the data
 
00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:52.019 align:start position:0%
Pro Center that the doe has for looking
 
00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:55.140 align:start position:0%
at the same information for example the
 
00:08:58.009 --> 00:08:58.019 align:start position:0%
fifth grade class in 2010
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
was at 75 percent proficient in
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
mathematics sixth grade 71 percent
 
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
in the 2012 a seventh grader 67 percent
 
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:13.740 align:start position:0%
8th grade 66 percent that's 2013. in
 
00:09:16.009 --> 00:09:16.019 align:start position:0%
2016 because there's two years we didn't
 
00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
do the testing there in 11th grade 40
 
00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:22.019 align:start position:0%
percent proficient it just goes like
 
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
this and then we see this real drop
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
coming out of middle school and going
 
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
into High School
 
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
and when we looked at this particular
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
program in front of you today we looked
 
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:35.220 align:start position:0%
at uh developing I did this in
 
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the community college
 
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
system New Hampshire and folks behind me
 
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
and Beth Dorian I don't see Beth here
 
00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:45.779 align:start position:0%
today but we looked at how can we really
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
change this trend that we have going on
 
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:09:51.889 --> 00:09:51.899 align:start position:0%
so we implemented a program called math
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
learning communities that was a grant
 
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
that community college system had
 
00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:58.019 align:start position:0%
received two hundred thousand dollars
 
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
it's a grant that did a lot of good
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
we at by the time we were in several
 
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
years into this grant we had 37 38 high
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
schools participating across the state
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
what it does is you can look in the
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
bottom side of the sheet here you can
 
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
see that for example in Algebra 1 is
 
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
taken in the 10th grade upon completing
 
00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
the 10th grade what we got gave to the
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
students was the Next Generation
 
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:26.220 align:start position:0%
accuplacer test that's a test which are
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
an assessment which has been used to
 
00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:30.779 align:start position:0%
identify Readiness for going into the
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to find out if these
 
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
students coming out of 10th grade
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
algebra 1 are really ready to go ahead
 
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
to Algebra 2 trig geometry
 
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.030 align:start position:0%
to Algebra 2 trig geometry
calculus

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
calculus
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
and we found that there was a number of
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
students that weren't really math ready
 
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:52.700 align:start position:0%
they scored like a 63 or lower in the
 
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
accuplacer test so what we looked at is
 
00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
there another way of trying to get the
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
mass foundations that are necessary into
 
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
these youngsters before they graduate
 
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
because what we were also seeing that
 
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
when they went off to Community College
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
or post-secondary education primarily
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
the community college system
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
we saw that 60 of the students at that
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
time required what we call remedial
 
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:21.959 align:start position:0%
education now we're trying to assist
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
these students through working in the
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
class and working at specific holes or
 
00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:29.459 align:start position:0%
weaknesses but we of that 60 percent
 
00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:32.519 align:start position:0%
50 percent never got a two-year degree
 
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
so we spent a lot of money
 
00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
and they spent a lot of money
 
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
trying to get this degree but they had
 
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
this hole they weren't ready for college
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
level mathematics so what we did at the
 
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
end of 10th grade after working with
 
00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:49.019 align:start position:0%
parent with counselors Math teachers in
 
00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:52.019 align:start position:0%
the schools we found we we looked at
 
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
this next Generation accuplacer test
 
00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
assessment and determined there were
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
students which would benefit going from
 
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
going a different track to try and get
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
these skills into them so what this
 
00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:06.779 align:start position:0%
program did is set a program called math
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
foundations and then quantitative math
 
00:12:11.449 --> 00:12:11.459 align:start position:0%
which would be taught in the 12th grade
 
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:13.740 align:start position:0%
so math foundations in 11th grade
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
students went that track and learned the
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
mathematics through different ways they
 
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
applied the mathematics they looked at
 
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
the skills that are necessary that
 
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
algebra one links with algebra 2 they it
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
was taught in such a way that it was
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
Applied Mathematics
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
upon completing that course and those
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
students that went on to quantitative
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
math if they scored on that accuplacer
 
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
at a level there was a score that we
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
were able to identify then and if they
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
got a C or better
 
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
they automatically received the four
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
credits for college mathematics so they
 
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
are ready to go into college and compete
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
with other students and they already had
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
that math uh requirement under their
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
belts and were able to go farther so
 
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
what the program is happened is that we
 
00:13:08.569 --> 00:13:08.579 align:start position:0%
haven't funded the two hundred thousand
 
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
dollars that's necessary to keep this
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
afloat through the community college
 
00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:16.200 align:start position:0%
system we received materials textbooks
 
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
worksheets all that
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
we also received training in the
 
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
summertime this money includes bringing
 
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
teachers down from various schools and
 
00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:27.899 align:start position:0%
having teachers teaching teachers that
 
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
have been in this program and with the
 
00:13:32.569 --> 00:13:32.579 align:start position:0%
assistance of of professional folks out
 
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
of the community college system training
 
00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
these people on how to teach math
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
foundations and quantitative math
 
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
they went back to their schools and we
 
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
saw a tremendous success
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
so and the 200 000 pays for the
 
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
transportation down the summertime and
 
00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:52.019 align:start position:0%
pays for the instruction we're also
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
receiving from the community college
 
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
system Direction and support and
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
coordination of this program and that
 
00:13:59.569 --> 00:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
would be through the community college
 
00:14:01.009 --> 00:14:01.019 align:start position:0%
system and I'm sure they can explain
 
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
that to you as they come out
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
so this is a timely uh bill as I've
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned to you because we have this uh
 
00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:12.660 align:start position:0%
real issue in our state right now and
 
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to see a number of bills
 
00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:15.899 align:start position:0%
floating at you this year trying to
 
00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
resolve how we can help raise the bar in
 
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
mathematics in the state yeah you can
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
look at the aggregate scores and yes we
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
are fourth or fifth highest in the
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
country on our aggregate scores but
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
we're not where New Hampshire wants to
 
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.910 align:start position:0%
we're not where New Hampshire wants to
be

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
I just had a bill this morning we were
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
talking about Proficiency in London area
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
in Nashua and some of our high schools
 
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
you look at the math proficiency scores
 
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:44.220 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly it's pretty pathetic
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
we are not where we need to be and so
 
00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:48.660 align:start position:0%
what we need to do is get this training
 
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
into the folks we have a lot of schools
 
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
now are trying to start to correct this
 
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
but this is something that's bigger than
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
that we need to correct it on our state
 
00:14:59.329 --> 00:14:59.339 align:start position:0%
level we need to find out where the
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
holes are and remediate those holes and
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
and you'll see us come forward when and
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
an individual doe to help us do that so
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to take any more time I
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
know you got a busy schedule ahead of
 
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
you I will drop off some of this
 
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
information which I have on charting the
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
cohorts as they go through school we've
 
00:15:20.449 --> 00:15:20.459 align:start position:0%
done it for all these different groups
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
and the same trend is there at the end
 
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
of Middle School our scores take a huge
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
dive this is one reason why we did
 
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
several years ago require four years of
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
mathematics one year of the math is
 
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:35.220 align:start position:0%
embedded you have to have three years to
 
00:15:37.629 --> 00:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
get out as a minimum
 
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
credits to get out of high school but we
 
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
require four years one of those courses
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
in the high school has to be embedded or
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
take the fourth year mathematics
 
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
embedding math skills into social
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
studies using spreadsheets knowing how
 
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
to make a spreadsheet using it in
 
00:15:56.449 --> 00:15:56.459 align:start position:0%
science that's embedded math that has to
 
00:15:57.769 --> 00:15:57.779 align:start position:0%
be approved by your local school board
 
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
questions Pete
 
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair is there a gender
 
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.009 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair is there a gender
difference

00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:07.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:10.019 align:start position:0%
a gender difference
 
00:16:10.019 --> 00:16:12.110 align:start position:0%
a gender difference
yeah

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
when I was a school principal back in
 
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
Maine years ago and I ended up my
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
Administration all that elsewhere
 
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
but we did a study up in arusta County
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
Presque Isle Caribou area Limestone when
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
there was an air base up there
 
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
we took the girls and put them for
 
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
mathematics in one class we put the boys
 
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
over there all the social stuff
 
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
disappeared we did see growth on the
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
part of both groups
 
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
so then it was decided that well
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
spreading them apart is not really the
 
00:16:47.329 --> 00:16:47.339 align:start position:0%
answers the answer is try to stop all
 
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
that social stuff from going on and and
 
00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
uh that's tough to do when you're in
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
high school
 
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
um I've been there uh so I I'm I'm not
 
00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
going to answer your questions all the
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
way but uh I think that you're you're
 
00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
you might ask the community college
 
00:17:06.169 --> 00:17:06.179 align:start position:0%
system behind me are they saying you
 
00:17:06.179 --> 00:17:07.189 align:start position:0%
system behind me are they saying you
know

00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
gender related to what they're seeing up
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
there I don't know I don't have the
 
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
answer on that one I'm not going to go
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
there either well I guess I was asking
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
your data that you're collecting doesn't
 
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
track gender no my the data that we're
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
tracking is aggregate of the school if
 
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
it's more than 10 students at a grade
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
level of course and and uh and uh
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
um so what the question I wanted to ask
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
you I think you answered it but where'd
 
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
you come up with the 200 000 it seems
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
like now I I think I heard you say now
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
that you're just replacing the original
 
00:17:46.679 --> 00:17:48.110 align:start position:0%
that you're just replacing the original
Grant

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
Grant
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
yes and that was the original Grant of
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
200 000 and what we have is we have
 
00:17:54.409 --> 00:17:54.419 align:start position:0%
people already a community college
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
system are well trained on delivering
 
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
um the the materials are I I've seen all
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
those materials they're easily run off
 
00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
um with a copy machine or and those are
 
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
available and what I've been told by the
 
00:18:12.169 --> 00:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
community college system that this will
 
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
make this program work remember we do
 
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
have 37 38 high schools which had
 
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
started that program so those a lot of
 
00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
those materials and training is already
 
00:18:24.049 --> 00:18:24.059 align:start position:0%
there and we're going to use people that
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
are trained in this to train others so
 
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
there should be some reduction in costs
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
that way
 
00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:33.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman nice to see you
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
again miss uh president uh
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative glad matter of fact I
 
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
experienced Limestone and lowering I
 
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
know he did Mr Air Force so hey it's uh
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
it was a good experience
 
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
uh matter of fact that's where we first
 
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
started our married life
 
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
uh how much effect do you think
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
the systems like everyday math like
 
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.610 align:start position:0%
the systems like everyday math like
lattice

00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:57.620 align:start position:0%
lattice
 
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh Common Core all these
 
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if I'd I'd uh
 
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
put it on that I had a meeting with Math
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
teachers in the Rivendell School
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
District not more in about a month and a
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
half two months ago Rivendell is the
 
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
interstate District we have Orford and
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
Fairley Vermont
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
and I met with all the math teachers at
 
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
the high school middle Elementary and
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
um High School
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
I think that there is
 
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
an issue that we need to address locally
 
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
as well are Math teachers talking with
 
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
Math teachers at different levels
 
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
oftentimes the elementary kids in in
 
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
Fairly are taught all our New Hampshire
 
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
kids go over to Vermont for elementary
 
00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:51.059 align:start position:0%
school the high school middle schools on
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
the Orford Side in New Hampshire do we
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
get together and really discuss K
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
through 12 and coordinate our curriculum
 
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
and our instruction and are we all
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
seeing instruction the same when I met
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
with those folks there was questions
 
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
half of them felt we have to really go
 
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
after the multiplication tables
 
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
memorization the other half saying well
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
maybe we ought to just talk teach them
 
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
how it works the principles behind it so
 
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
if we're split in terms of you know how
 
00:20:24.169 --> 00:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
to teach and so in in the in my district
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
up in Haverhill SAU 23 right now they're
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
looking at their their curriculum right
 
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
now and think about overhauling the
 
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
whole thing
 
00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
um that's good however it may be costly
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
as well this is why we need to have the
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
analyst there at the Department of
 
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
Education it's going to help us do that
 
00:20:45.409 --> 00:20:45.419 align:start position:0%
deep dive maybe there's only holes in
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
our current math program we can clamp
 
00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
the holes and save money and also
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
increase our proficiency so I would say
 
00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
much of this I believe is at the local
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
level I wouldn't lay it on Common Core I
 
00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
wouldn't lay it on because we all
 
00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
believe we all believe kids have to be
 
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.570 align:start position:0%
believe we all believe kids have to be
competent

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
competent
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
Common Core was made up of competencies
 
00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
and so what we got to look at and make
 
00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
sure those competencies are being taught
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
at the level that we're testing
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
and and that's another issue matching up
 
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
our assessment to our curriculum looking
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
at our standards do our standards
 
00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:30.539 align:start position:0%
parallel at the grade levels at the
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
state to what our grade levels are doing
 
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
sometimes you can have an assessment
 
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
test and it's testing for example it
 
00:21:39.169 --> 00:21:39.179 align:start position:0%
could be social studies U.S history we
 
00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:40.860 align:start position:0%
teach U.S history at what grade level
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
another school at another grade level if
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
you test at that one grade level earlier
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
the one that hasn't had it yet is
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
obviously going to have low assessment
 
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.909 align:start position:0%
obviously going to have low assessment
scores

00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
scores
 
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
so one of the keys is that we get on
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
board with our Assessment program and
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
know what we're assessing and align it
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the questions
 
00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:07.700 align:start position:0%
I really should start by apologizing for
 
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
inadvertently uh sending the education
 
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
committee an email I intended for the
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
election committee I got my bills mixed
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
up so sorry for that little bit of spam
 
00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
still a good video but not meant for you
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
my apologies my question is since I'm a
 
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
freshman could you help me understand a
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
bit more why you know this program is
 
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
valuable in terms of you know why is the
 
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
Community College needed to assist the
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
high schools you know deliver on their
 
00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
math curriculum because you know
 
00:22:39.649 --> 00:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
obviously there are more experienced
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
people here but I would I could really
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
use a bit of that background well the
 
00:22:45.289 --> 00:22:45.299 align:start position:0%
community college system as well as the
 
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
university system have the folks which
 
00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
are training our teachers for one
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
um in looking at this they have the
 
00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
capability of coordinating uh rather
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
than having let's say the department do
 
00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
it uh we're working with career Pathways
 
00:23:03.649 --> 00:23:03.659 align:start position:0%
and certification that's offered through
 
00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
the community college system which is
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
oftentimes linked through our concurrent
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
and dual enrollment programs which are
 
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
taught in the high school there's a lot
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
of interaction now between the community
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
college system and high schools and I
 
00:23:18.529 --> 00:23:18.539 align:start position:0%
hope it goes down to Middle Schools as
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
well so in in in that regard I think
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
that the to use and they have the staff
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
available to work with our high school
 
00:23:29.039 --> 00:23:30.250 align:start position:0%
available to work with our high school
teachers

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:30.260 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
we have now some in fact a number we're
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
seeing we're seeing gains going forward
 
00:23:39.649 --> 00:23:39.659 align:start position:0%
especially when we look at our
 
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
concurrent dual enrollment program
 
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
participation is going up however here
 
00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:45.860 align:start position:0%
is an opportunities for us to use that
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
expertise that wisdom that the community
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
college has in in saying here's some of
 
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
the holes we are seeing when we are
 
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
receiving these students in the high
 
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
school from the high schools we have
 
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
oftentimes thought it was a community
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
college system you fix this
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
but after we discussed on the education
 
00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:07.559 align:start position:0%
committee for years it's not the
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
community college's problem
 
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
it's our K-12 issue we're sending the
 
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
kids to them in a remedial fashion and
 
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
so they're saying here's the holes we
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
see we can work with you I think it's
 
00:24:21.649 --> 00:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
great we should look at education not as
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
K-12 but k-16 quick quick follow-up
 
00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:27.299 align:start position:0%
and this is strictly a voluntary program
 
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
where high schools can choose to you
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
know take the help or not yes thank you
 
00:24:32.159 --> 00:24:35.210 align:start position:0%
know take the help or not yes thank you
sir

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
the way we teach teachers is that a
 
00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
problem is that the problem
 
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
in other words the teachers colleges
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
I mean we are from your from your
 
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.190 align:start position:0%
I mean we are from your from your
assessment

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
we have a teacher shortage committee
 
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
going on right now I'm on that there's a
 
00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
lot of different variables which are
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
coming into why we have that teacher
 
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.549 align:start position:0%
coming into why we have that teacher
shortage

00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
um and it has to do also with the the
 
00:25:06.289 --> 00:25:06.299 align:start position:0%
shortage areas which we're seeing are
 
00:25:06.299 --> 00:25:07.370 align:start position:0%
shortage areas which we're seeing are
science

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
science
 
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:10.919 align:start position:0%
math special education technology those
 
00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:12.620 align:start position:0%
are the shortage areas
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
mathematics has always been a shortage
 
00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.730 align:start position:0%
mathematics has always been a shortage
area

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:16.740 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
how are teaching mathematics in the
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
maybe they need more math there I don't
 
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
know at that level maybe they need less
 
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
gen Ed and more skill oriented subjects
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
at that wonderful article in the Wall
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
Street Journal this last weekend on why
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
we have four-year degrees maybe we only
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
need three take all the Gen Ed stuff out
 
00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:43.100 align:start position:0%
and teach the skills kids need
 
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:25:48.529 --> 00:25:48.539 align:start position:0%
um this program is wonderful and I think
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
that every kind of refresher or anything
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
we can do to help our students
 
00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
um renew their interest in mathematics
 
00:26:00.409 --> 00:26:00.419 align:start position:0%
is another way to build their
 
00:26:02.769 --> 00:26:02.779 align:start position:0%
mathematics kids all learn in different
 
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
levels at different paces and for so
 
00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:08.220 align:start position:0%
many students they forget
 
00:26:10.909 --> 00:26:10.919 align:start position:0%
what they've learned and I think this is
 
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
a way to catch them up especially before
 
00:26:15.169 --> 00:26:15.179 align:start position:0%
they go into the Community College it's
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
a wonderful program I'm really
 
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
disappointed that in fact we haven't
 
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
funded this consistently I remember very
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
well when Paul leather and I worked with
 
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
the Community College about the level of
 
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
mathematics at the community college and
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
we were really concerned so I I hope
 
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
that we decide to retain this for
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
consideration for the budget you know I
 
00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:39.059 align:start position:0%
hope so too the when I was working with
 
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
General Barrette he was the AG over the
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
National Guard here he and I both went
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
to OCS Army and uh when I was talking
 
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
with him when we took our Howitzer
 
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
batteries in the state here and put them
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
into more of a missile oriented we
 
00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
shared our our Battalion with West
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
Virginia and New Hampshire went in the
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
same unit he told me the folks we want
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
to hire folks from New Hampshire not
 
00:27:09.769 --> 00:27:09.779 align:start position:0%
West Virginia because the New Hampshire
 
00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
kids are thinkers they're have good
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
professional work skills but they all
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
all have this innate ability to do the
 
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
mathematics we need we just need to keep
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
it there but we are strong our kids are
 
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
ready for this and we shouldn't leave
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
any of these youngsters behind
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
especially when we have this alternative
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
way of really ensuring that it's taught
 
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
the way they learn matching learning
 
00:27:36.169 --> 00:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:37.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative lad I think I just have a
 
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up question to make sure I
 
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
heard you correctly
 
00:27:45.409 --> 00:27:45.419 align:start position:0%
um I think when you are speaking about
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
your um little handout here that at one
 
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
point you said the two hundred thousand
 
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
dollars would cover both transportation
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
and instruction
 
00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
did I think that's for the training
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
program in the summertime they so it
 
00:28:00.409 --> 00:28:00.419 align:start position:0%
takes care they get a mild reimbursement
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
similar to what we receive as
 
00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:12.169 --> 00:28:12.179 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
so in in North Conway um the community
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
college is going to is going to uh
 
00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
eliminate their overhead with their
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
physical brick and mortar
 
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
um school that they're using right now
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
and and move the programs into the
 
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
Kennett High School and just recently
 
00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
president president Lloyd made a
 
00:28:36.649 --> 00:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
presentation to the Local School Board
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
and and he started out by saying we have
 
00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
these programs and how do we attract
 
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
people to to the programs but then they
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
turned it around and rethought it and
 
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
said why don't we bring the programs to
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
where the kids are so bringing all their
 
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:51.830 align:start position:0%
where the kids are so bringing all their
um

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
they're dual and concurrent and and
 
00:28:57.529 --> 00:28:57.539 align:start position:0%
they're running stock programs it and by
 
00:29:00.529 --> 00:29:00.539 align:start position:0%
the way a much discounted price 150 per
 
00:29:00.539 --> 00:29:01.730 align:start position:0%
the way a much discounted price 150 per
cost

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:01.740 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
and also uh
 
00:29:06.409 --> 00:29:06.419 align:start position:0%
um get building up their college credits
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
while they're still in high school
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
and by by merging with by bringing the
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
community college and merging it with
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
with the high school
 
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
and that's a good move forward that's
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
what has to be done elsewhere in the
 
00:29:21.889 --> 00:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
state as well thank you
 
00:29:24.169 --> 00:29:24.179 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative thank you
 
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
does anyone else want to speak on this
 
00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:36.470 align:start position:0%
does anyone else want to speak on this
bill

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
Dr Chancellor good morning Mark
 
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
Rubinstein from the community college
 
00:29:42.649 --> 00:29:42.659 align:start position:0%
system I'll just speak briefly to
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
reinforce what representative Ladd
 
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
shared we've been doing a little bit of
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
background work since representative
 
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:52.100 align:start position:0%
land brought this back to the table
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
we've looked across the community
 
00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
college system to identify colleagues
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
who've been working on this project when
 
00:30:00.769 --> 00:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
it was first initiated we've done some
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
Outreach to identify Educators in
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
secondary schools who'd be interested
 
00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
partners for this starting to take a
 
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
look at curriculum to figure out the
 
00:30:12.409 --> 00:30:12.419 align:start position:0%
courses so we're prepared to support
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
this if the legislature chooses to
 
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.409 align:start position:0%
this if the legislature chooses to
reinvest

00:30:18.409 --> 00:30:18.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
any questions for the chancellor
 
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
which I knew a Dream It's Made by Joe
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
seconded by Mary all those in favor just
 
00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:39.620 align:start position:0%
raise your hand we won't call the roll
 
00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
okay unanimous for the record
 
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
okay I think we'll close a discussion on
 
00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
uh house uh House Bill 419 and we'll
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
move to house bill 420.
 
00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
has to do with the Dual concur
 
00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.789 align:start position:0%
has to do with the Dual concur
enrollment

00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:00.539 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd you have a comment
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
well thank you once again uh for the
 
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
record Rick Ladd here from New Hampshire
 
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
uh the due on concurrent enrollment
 
00:31:18.769 --> 00:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
program is one which uh when we we
 
00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
started this program
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
oh how many years ago
 
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:24.860 align:start position:0%
um I would say
 
00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:28.740 align:start position:0%
2017 they're roughly or 18.
 
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
um this is a program and representative
 
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
Buco just referenced that you know 150
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
bucks for a course right now while
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
you're in in the high school first
 
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
waiting until after you graduate from
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
high school to take that same course 150
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
bucks for the course but after high
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
school if you're going to do it at the
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
community college system it would cost
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
you close to what thirteen hundred
 
00:31:53.159 --> 00:31:54.590 align:start position:0%
you close to what thirteen hundred
dollars

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
so just think of that savings that if a
 
00:31:59.149 --> 00:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
student could get this done while
 
00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:02.820 align:start position:0%
they're in grades 10 11 or 12. what the
 
00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
bill before you does we are now
 
00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:09.059 align:start position:0%
extending this program to grade 10.
 
00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
Beyond 11 and 12 which we're already
 
00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
doing it we're also opening it up to
 
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
rather than two courses per year one can
 
00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
take up to five courses per year
 
00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
and we're also extending it to courses
 
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
that are not just stem courses Science
 
00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
Tech engineering and Mathematics
 
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:32.340 align:start position:0%

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
we've learned that there are a lot of
 
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
writing skills that a person needs in
 
00:32:48.289 --> 00:32:48.299 align:start position:0%

00:33:00.529 --> 00:33:00.539 align:start position:0%
there's a number of other courses which
 
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
we want students to take while they're
 
00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
in high school which are not stem simply
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
because it motivates them that I can
 
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
take I can go to higher education I can
 
00:33:15.049 --> 00:33:15.059 align:start position:0%
make it and my own daughter did this
 
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
years ago in another state in Alaska
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
where she took some courses in child
 
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
care while she was in high school and
 
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:25.140 align:start position:0%
got college credits from UAA uaf
 
00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
University Alaska Fairbanks for that
 
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
while she was also getting credit the
 
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
same time for graduating from high
 
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
school they did this way before we did
 
00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.090 align:start position:0%
school they did this way before we did
it

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
she took these courses and found out she
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
can do it now she's a speech pathologist
 
00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:42.299 align:start position:0%
down at Pawleys Island South Carolina
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
and having a wonderful career it was the
 
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
start and those credits were accepted by
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
Elmira College on her bachelor's level
 
00:33:51.649 --> 00:33:51.659 align:start position:0%
and then accepted later when she went to
 
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
University of South Carolina med school
 
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
to get the Audiology degree
 
00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
so this program allows students to
 
00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:01.380 align:start position:0%
receive college credit at the same time
 
00:34:03.889 --> 00:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
they're getting high school credit they
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
can take the course in the high school
 
00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:08.339 align:start position:0%
the high school teacher who's teaching
 
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
this course
 
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
has to meet all the standards of a
 
00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
professor at the community college
 
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
system New Hampshire you're going to
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
have two of your Masters you're going to
 
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
have to have uh meet all those criteria
 
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
that are so that are necessary to be a
 
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
teacher or professor at the community
 
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
college system so the standards aren't
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
lessened any they're same standards
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
while the course is being taken but what
 
00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
it does do it allows students to start
 
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
taking these courses
 
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
early on in their High School careers we
 
00:34:43.129 --> 00:34:43.139 align:start position:0%
have some students now that are
 
00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:45.419 align:start position:0%
graduating from high school believe it
 
00:34:49.089 --> 00:34:49.099 align:start position:0%
or not they have close to one whole year
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
of college credit already under their
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
belts and that is transferable into the
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
community college system and after we
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
work with the community college system
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
and the university system last year and
 
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
trying to ensure that these are
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
transferable between the community
 
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
college system and the the community
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
college system and the university system
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
where I have 30 different degrees which
 
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
that is being done in right now we're
 
00:35:17.329 --> 00:35:17.339 align:start position:0%
seeing the system working together High
 
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:19.380 align:start position:0%
School Community College and the
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
university system and trying to
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
ease the burden of this debt that
 
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
students we have not what the second or
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
the highest college level debt in the
 
00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
country here in New Hampshire
 
00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
we can avoid that and when we initiated
 
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
this bill back in 17 we were only paying
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
in this program uh 850 000 in the first
 
00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
year and then FY 19 950 000 it's since
 
00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:52.619 align:start position:0%
grown now to its 1.5 million dollars per
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
year and this bill is asking we go to
 
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.470 align:start position:0%
year and this bill is asking we go to
3.25

00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
3.25
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
million per year by doing this you're
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
saving up in a double digit
 
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
figures Millions dollars for our
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
students later on if they had to take
 
00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
all these courses later on
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
so it's saving debt at the same time
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's raising the bar while we're in high
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
school and that that is needed so I will
 
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
stop there I do have a hand I can make
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
copies for you get that to you as well
 
00:36:26.569 --> 00:36:26.579 align:start position:0%
as I did in the first one I'll get all
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
this to you for the record
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay questions Tom
 
00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
thank you so if I understand this
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
program this provides the tuition for
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
um five courses and if they if a student
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
wants to take more than that they can
 
00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
they can pay for it on their own it's
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
out of their own pocket yes but but it
 
00:36:47.569 --> 00:36:47.579 align:start position:0%
does provide the tuition for up to five
 
00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:50.579 align:start position:0%
up to five which is a really a
 
00:36:53.329 --> 00:36:53.339 align:start position:0%
tremendous gain
 
00:36:55.849 --> 00:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
for those students it certainly is thank
 
00:36:55.859 --> 00:36:58.910 align:start position:0%
for those students it certainly is thank
you

00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
you mentioned competencies before
 
00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
why should we have a line between
 
00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
community college and high school
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
if you're competent in something doesn't
 
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:13.140 align:start position:0%
make any difference when you get that
 
00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.270 align:start position:0%
make any difference when you get that
knowledge

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:16.140 align:start position:0%
and to fill a matrix
 
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
it would seem so you would you would
 
00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
eliminate that line of or or have the
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
competency at a level say at the college
 
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.230 align:start position:0%
competency at a level say at the college
level

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
or on a subject
 
00:37:29.089 --> 00:37:29.099 align:start position:0%
what do you feel about that
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
I'm having a hard time tracking what
 
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
you're asking well you said competency
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
yeah okay your competency in English so
 
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
say okay you and have to develop a
 
00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.050 align:start position:0%
say okay you and have to develop a
standard

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
and meet that standard once you meet
 
00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
that standard it doesn't make any
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
difference when you meet that standard
 
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
as long as you meet that standard
 
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
because that way even though an eighth
 
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
grader could uh if if if you write the
 
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
standard correctly
 
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
it would it would work it seemed to me
 
00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
it would work it I you know like I I
 
00:37:59.410 --> 00:37:59.420 align:start position:0%
took physics in high school
 
00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
and the the person teaching it knew was
 
00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
subject well but he couldn't get it into
 
00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
this head
 
00:38:08.569 --> 00:38:08.579 align:start position:0%
I took the same subject
 
00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
in at the community college level
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
and he was a previous engineer civil uh
 
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
mechanical engineer it's at uh General
 
00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
Electric and you know I could follow him
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
and I I got an A I mean you know it's if
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
they if the delivery isn't you know on
 
00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
you what how you learn it's I mean
 
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's a big problem it comes down to
 
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
teaching style and learning style
 
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
and there are some of you that are very
 
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
auditory some they're very tactile
 
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
physical type stuff in learning when I
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
and there's other methods too when I
 
00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:44.700 align:start position:0%
took trigonometry I could regurgitate
 
00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:47.220 align:start position:0%
everything in it where I really learned
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
trig is when I was dropped out of a huey
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
in Vietnam with my aiming sticks and all
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
that and triangulation and surveying
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out where we're going
 
00:38:59.450 --> 00:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
to put that battery coming in I learned
 
00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
how to do that real quickly and it made
 
00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
sense because I was actually doing it I
 
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
wanted to get out of there and so
 
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
um I guess there's many students like
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
myself that have a hard time reading
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
this and say okay I like to have to I
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
like to do it as for I learn as I do
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
and just like in your carpentry you
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
learn from your mistakes well I so
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
there's it goes on the teaching style
 
00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
learning style if you have a teacher
 
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
that's not on the same page as far as
 
00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:31.140 align:start position:0%
how you learn you're going to have a
 
00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
tough time that's that happens right
 
00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
down in first grade second grade right
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
well to you know to follow up with what
 
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
you just said in that physics uh example
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
I I love to hunt at the time especially
 
00:39:45.359 --> 00:39:46.190 align:start position:0%
I I love to hunt at the time especially
then

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
and uh he would the example was trig
 
00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
and using a trig to shoot a deer how
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
many feet would you have to lead the
 
00:39:58.130 --> 00:39:58.140 align:start position:0%
deer if you knew how fast the deer was
 
00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
going across your field of view I mean
 
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
and I mean that that fits right in and
 
00:40:04.609 --> 00:40:04.619 align:start position:0%
then and what what I developed here was
 
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
a loaf of trick because there's a lot of
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
things you can do with trig that in
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
other parts of your life
 
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
I mean it it was just amazing what uh
 
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
you know what what he could get into
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
I think we all agree the merits of the
 
00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:26.099 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment program are excellent I
 
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
I'd like to I think we all like it a lot
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
because we've talked about it multiple
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
times I I'd like to move forward and
 
00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
me too yeah but um
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um it's a great program and
 
00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for expanding it um to you
 
00:40:47.089 --> 00:40:47.099 align:start position:0%
know thinking skills and the writing
 
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
skills I that's wonderful but can you
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
give me a narrative of so this money
 
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
goes to the Community College
 
00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
um if you didn't have this money would
 
00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
there be courses not offered in the high
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
school in this program I understand that
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
it's going for tuition but where I have
 
00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:07.079 align:start position:0%
a gap of my understanding is if you
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
didn't have this would those there not
 
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
be courses in the high school that that
 
00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
do this do you understand what I'm
 
00:41:14.329 --> 00:41:14.339 align:start position:0%
saying you you this program of course
 
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
you have running start early college you
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
can a high school student can also do
 
00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
this at the college location where you
 
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
can take a course there and get credit
 
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
this you know the same way it will cost
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
you a little bit more but it can be done
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
right there and we have students are
 
00:41:35.089 --> 00:41:35.099 align:start position:0%
doing that that's where you know and I
 
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
want to thank very much Shannon and mark
 
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
behind me the community college has been
 
00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079 align:start position:0%
a real proponent and leader in working
 
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
with public K-12 education and they
 
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
deserve that recognition for delving
 
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:50.460 align:start position:0%
down and helping us not just there but
 
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
with Career Tech as well
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
and so it's inspiring to see programs
 
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
like this this was you know I I've been
 
00:41:59.810 --> 00:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
talking I talked with them often about
 
00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
this program but this proposal is coming
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
out of them saying that we we can really
 
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
get more kids into this program we can
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
strengthen this program and help save
 
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:12.300 align:start position:0%
that debt that they're incurring later
 
00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
on and that's a critical component of
 
00:42:17.089 --> 00:42:17.099 align:start position:0%
this program just do the mathematics
 
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
figure and you're good at that because
 
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
that's your job here in finance but look
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
at what what would it cost a student to
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
take these courses not as running start
 
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:31.140 align:start position:0%
or early East or early college
 
00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
what what would it cost later after that
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know High School graduation
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
you would see it in the millions of
 
00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.470 align:start position:0%
you would see it in the millions of
dollars

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
and as so this is a tremendous
 
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity that we should not you know
 
00:42:47.329 --> 00:42:47.339 align:start position:0%
lose the money here is a definite
 
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:54.900 align:start position:0%
you find me
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and again thank you
 
00:42:58.609 --> 00:42:58.619 align:start position:0%
for taking the questions
 
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
I am um looking at the bill language and
 
00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
obviously we understand the intent
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
between behind you know increasing the
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
cap but I'm not sure I understand and
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
I'm actually very concerned about the
 
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
language that removes the requirement
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
that those be stem classes because to me
 
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
what made this program very effective is
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
that it was focused on you know
 
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
expertise that we agree the state is in
 
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
dire need and we need more students
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
trained in the fact that we remove that
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
seems to lose that focus and I'm just
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the intent behind
 
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
that and how do you feel that would
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
benefit you know the uh
 
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
State versus having left that in while
 
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
still increasing the cap I think I think
 
00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:46.140 align:start position:0%
part of that question should be asked of
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
Dr Rubin staying behind me the
 
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
chancellor but I can tell you that when
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with the directors of Career
 
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
Tech education throughout this state
 
00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
there is such thing they call soft
 
00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:58.490 align:start position:0%
there is such thing they call soft
skills

00:43:58.490 --> 00:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
skills
 
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
you have the skills very specific to the
 
00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:02.700 align:start position:0%
trade that they're learning
 
00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:04.740 align:start position:0%
but if they don't have the skills and
 
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
how to communicate
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
and interpret things and fill out an
 
00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
invoice and and do other other
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
components of the job which are above
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
and beyond knowing how to operate the
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
machine press or the Die Cast material
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
that that is where this is opening it up
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
to that side the Slate so we can get to
 
00:44:28.609 --> 00:44:28.619 align:start position:0%
communication skills as an opportunity
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
to uh be used to get credit for that
 
00:44:34.609 --> 00:44:34.619 align:start position:0%
type of training that you absolutely
 
00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
have to have to be successful in any
 
00:44:37.619 --> 00:44:38.569 align:start position:0%
have to have to be successful in any
career

00:44:38.569 --> 00:44:38.579 align:start position:0%
career
 
00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
thank you and just a quick follow-up no
 
00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
disagreement on the soft skills
 
00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
I've taught for a living and trust me
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
the teaching part is way harder than the
 
00:44:50.089 --> 00:44:50.099 align:start position:0%
understanding the technical side and
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
I've rubbed elbows with a lot of Geeks
 
00:44:56.109 --> 00:44:56.119 align:start position:0%
and people who really had a hard time
 
00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
functioning outside of their you know
 
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
happy place but while those particular
 
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
skills are indeed necessary this one
 
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't just expand that into soft
 
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
skills it basically gives a carte
 
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
blanche for any class of any kind and
 
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:16.140 align:start position:0%
again you know I would be comfortable
 
00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
with expanding from stem to include
 
00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
other things but just a broad you know
 
00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
removal of that Focus
 
00:45:25.849 --> 00:45:25.859 align:start position:0%
these courses have to be approved by the
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
00:45:32.089 --> 00:45:32.099 align:start position:0%
so so then you're you're really
 
00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
and as I alluded to earlier in my
 
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.290 align:start position:0%
and as I alluded to earlier in my
presentation

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
there when we
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
when we introduce sat as as what we're
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
going to use in the 11th grade for
 
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
determining whether they're meeting our
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
Statewide proficiencies at that level
 
00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
that was first started in Maine
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
and when Maine gave the s.a.t they all
 
00:45:55.849 --> 00:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
sudden found there's a number of
 
00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:58.140 align:start position:0%
students that were not planning on going
 
00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
on to college a number of students that
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
I can never be successful and they were
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
getting scores well above 500 600.
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
I can do it and so that's another thing
 
00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
with getting into these type other
 
00:46:14.329 --> 00:46:14.339 align:start position:0%
courses they can learn I can do it and
 
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
then you also then get involved with the
 
00:46:19.609 --> 00:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
the stem area yes I I'm a proponent of
 
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
stem but I'm also a proponent that we
 
00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
need to offer the opportunity for
 
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
students to get engaged in in in various
 
00:46:31.609 --> 00:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
restaurant type courses
 
00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
Etc that they will then go in different
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
and then maybe get into the chemistry
 
00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:53.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
Dr no but I I think the next one you got
 
00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
coming up is 5 42.
 
00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:02.510 align:start position:0%
coming up is 5 42.
542.

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:05.099 align:start position:0%
establishing academic research and
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
Improvement performance data analyst
 
00:47:12.069 --> 00:47:12.079 align:start position:0%
okay representative land thank you
 
00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
this is a a program which has been
 
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
communicated with and put forth by the
 
00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
00:47:22.609 --> 00:47:22.619 align:start position:0%
we have a department of one over there
 
00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at our Statewide
 
00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
assessment which we give to students
 
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
in the grades three through eight and
 
00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
then grade 11. and what we have and yes
 
00:47:35.809 --> 00:47:35.819 align:start position:0%
you can look on the web and you can get
 
00:47:38.089 --> 00:47:38.099 align:start position:0%
the aggregate scores you know the the
 
00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
scores for your state the scores for
 
00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:41.339 align:start position:0%
your school
 
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
but does it really give the the down in
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
the weeds detail information that is
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
needed for the individual schools to
 
00:47:52.609 --> 00:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
really assess and determine where their
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
strengths and weaknesses are in their
 
00:47:54.359 --> 00:47:56.030 align:start position:0%
strengths and weaknesses are in their
curriculum

00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
do these local school districts and we
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
have many many small districts Mary
 
00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
knows has represented Heath knows as a
 
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
result of being a commissioner At Doe
 
00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:07.140 align:start position:0%
that many of these smaller districts
 
00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
have minimal staff they may have
 
00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:12.140 align:start position:0%
Administration that's tied up of a
 
00:48:14.569 --> 00:48:14.579 align:start position:0%
superintendent part-time superintendent
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
and they may have somebody in charge of
 
00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
special education but that's where it
 
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
stops there's nobody there in curriculum
 
00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.210 align:start position:0%
stops there's nobody there in curriculum
development

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:23.220 align:start position:0%
development
 
00:48:26.809 --> 00:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
so how do we dig down and find out where
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
our holes are in meeting with Dr Greene
 
00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:32.220 align:start position:0%
over at the Department of Education
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
and with Caitlyn Davis
 
00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
that it's been determined that for us to
 
00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
really do the Deep dive we need into
 
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:41.720 align:start position:0%
these scores we need a data analysis
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
analysis over there somebody that's
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
going to be able to get down and measure
 
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
student progress evaluate program
 
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
instructional effect of this guide
 
00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
curriculum development resource
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
allocations and promote accountability
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
um that's collect you so we're going to
 
00:48:59.329 --> 00:48:59.339 align:start position:0%
be collecting this data analyzing the
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
data reporting the data using that data
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
for school Improvement mathematics
 
00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:08.420 align:start position:0%
communicating through this information
 
00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a position here
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's about a hundred and sixty
 
00:49:14.089 --> 00:49:14.099 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars first year then it's
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see less in the request for the
 
00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
second year of the biennium 145
 
00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
000 seeing many of these startup needs
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
the equipment all is already there so
 
00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
that that's why they have a lighter a
 
00:49:29.089 --> 00:49:29.099 align:start position:0%
little lighter cost there in fy25 this
 
00:49:32.329 --> 00:49:32.339 align:start position:0%
person is absolutely needed for us to
 
00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
really maximize our use of this
 
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
information which we're having which
 
00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
we're not doing right now when I've
 
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
asked asked over the years and
 
00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler and I have both
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
asked the same information where we're
 
00:49:47.089 --> 00:49:47.099 align:start position:0%
looking for accountability
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
we just haven't been able to get the
 
00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.270 align:start position:0%
we just haven't been able to get the
information

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:49:52.609 --> 00:49:52.619 align:start position:0%
one person over there can't provide the
 
00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
information how many times have we asked
 
00:49:56.569 --> 00:49:56.579 align:start position:0%
the department to really give us some
 
00:49:59.809 --> 00:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
specific information data regarding
 
00:50:01.849 --> 00:50:01.859 align:start position:0%
these tests and where kids are and what
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
we have to do
 
00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
it's just not there
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
tracking the cohorts back in 17 18 19 20
 
00:50:11.569 --> 00:50:11.579 align:start position:0%
I did that I tore those instrument those
 
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
tests apart and and we looked at that
 
00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
but that didn't go far enough it didn't
 
00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
say where do we have to help in
 
00:50:18.119 --> 00:50:19.370 align:start position:0%
say where do we have to help in
mathematics

00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
mathematics
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
this is what we need right here if we
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
really want to improve mathematics in
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
the state if we really want to improve
 
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:28.980 align:start position:0%
reading in this state we're going to
 
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
have to have more information we're
 
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
going to have to do a better diagnosis
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
of where we are in these tests not just
 
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
doing the here's your end result here's
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
where we are and now we're going to
 
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
lower the bar so we're all proficient
 
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
then cut it
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
so if we want to improve we're going to
 
00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:49.140 align:start position:0%
have to give that resource to the
 
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
department to do that when I first came
 
00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
on board here years ago there were
 
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
curriculum people at the department
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
is there anybody there now in curriculum
 
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
and curriculum development the answer is
 
00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:04.130 align:start position:0%
and curriculum development the answer is
no

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:04.140 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
yet we want to have all these Statewide
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
we have responsibilities A legislature
 
00:51:12.349 --> 00:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
to set these standards we have to review
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards for public school
 
00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
approval that's a responsibility state
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
board but they can't do that unless it's
 
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
approved by legislative oversight
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
do we have the information to really do
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
a good job in oversight
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think so
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
and so what we have to do is in working
 
00:51:31.609 --> 00:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
with them over there they're proposing
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
this this is a need this is a priority
 
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
of the department to have this data anal
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
analyst over there to help interpret
 
00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
this and work with districts and helping
 
00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
them interpret their scores as well
 
00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:49.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you um
 
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
cheerlead I have um
 
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
found it very disheartening quite
 
00:51:56.089 --> 00:51:56.099 align:start position:0%
frankly that the department has
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
eliminated so many different well I
 
00:51:59.450 --> 00:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
don't know if I don't know if it's us in
 
00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
the finance committee that's eliminated
 
00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
so many positions but I know that when I
 
00:52:05.569 --> 00:52:05.579 align:start position:0%
was Deputy Commissioner I had four
 
00:52:08.569 --> 00:52:08.579 align:start position:0%
content area people and I had um someone
 
00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:11.339 align:start position:0%
who did the data analysis and those
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
people not only did that work at the
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
state level but then they went out to
 
00:52:16.609 --> 00:52:16.619 align:start position:0%
school districts worked with school
 
00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
districts held various amounts of of
 
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
workshops and and trainings to build the
 
00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
skills that children need I think was a
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
big loss for our state so indeed I am
 
00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
all for this I actually would like to
 
00:52:32.089 --> 00:52:32.099 align:start position:0%
see us go back to more curriculum area
 
00:52:35.089 --> 00:52:35.099 align:start position:0%
people as well but um I would like to
 
00:52:35.099 --> 00:52:36.770 align:start position:0%
people as well but um I would like to
absolutely

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
um support this bill and I know this
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
bipartisan effort and and certainly
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
Caitlin Davis needs a lot more help
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
thank you absolutely thank you thank you
 
00:52:45.599 --> 00:52:48.109 align:start position:0%
thank you absolutely thank you thank you
Mr

00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:48.119 --> 00:52:49.790 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:52:51.309 --> 00:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
career development of teachers what are
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
we doing there are we doing are we going
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
too much on the social side I mean we're
 
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
if you have to recertify you know over
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
time teachers that is
 
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
I mean where are we going
 
00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
I mean it seems so
 
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
something's not working here it's it's
 
00:53:20.329 --> 00:53:20.339 align:start position:0%
for a skew and it's
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
I just don't I I don't have the answer
 
00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
maybe uh I know you've been around this
 
00:53:26.329 --> 00:53:26.339 align:start position:0%
uh we well we've been around this for a
 
00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
while now
 
00:53:29.809 --> 00:53:29.819 align:start position:0%
and it's uh it seems so we we keep
 
00:53:32.329 --> 00:53:32.339 align:start position:0%
rehashing the same thing have tons of
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
development you know career development
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
in within the schools I know that for
 
00:53:37.319 --> 00:53:38.030 align:start position:0%
in within the schools I know that for
sure

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
being a uh
 
00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
on a school board and it just but it's
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
not getting anywhere the standards
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
should be going much higher
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
I think we've got to get back on the
 
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
bill Joe no well no but this is this is
 
00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
about the bill I mean what what are we
 
00:53:57.530 --> 00:53:57.540 align:start position:0%
doing I mean we need somebody to analyze
 
00:53:59.569 --> 00:53:59.579 align:start position:0%
the data that's true now we're back on
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
why I mean the question is why why are
 
00:54:07.569 --> 00:54:07.579 align:start position:0%
the standards bad and are we not
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
represent Petrie I'd be glad to talk to
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and again thank you
 
00:54:16.609 --> 00:54:16.619 align:start position:0%
chairman lad
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand
 
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
why is this something that requires a
 
00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
new position rather than something the
 
00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:25.980 align:start position:0%
doe could potentially do with existing
 
00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
staff I mean I'm just again
 
00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:30.900 align:start position:0%
new to everything so I would really
 
00:54:32.809 --> 00:54:32.819 align:start position:0%
appreciate a bit of background on what
 
00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
prevents the department right now from
 
00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
performing this which would require a
 
00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
new person to be hired we have one
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
person over in the department to do all
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
the state right now Nate green
 
00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:45.059 align:start position:0%
got a doctor in this subject area he's
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
probably the top-notch person you're
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
going to find in this state to do what
 
00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:49.640 align:start position:0%
he's doing
 
00:54:53.809 --> 00:54:53.819 align:start position:0%
exceptional uh uh understanding of all
 
00:54:53.819 --> 00:54:54.650 align:start position:0%
exceptional uh uh understanding of all
this

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
to really do this correctly though he
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
does need that support if we are going
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
to want to have that data provided to us
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
if we as legislatures are coming forth
 
00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
and saying well an extraordinary needs
 
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
Grant we need some accountability okay
 
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
how are we going to measure that
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
accountability and what are we going to
 
00:55:14.809 --> 00:55:14.819 align:start position:0%
use to do that will we be using
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
information At Doe provides us
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
I you know it depends on how we set that
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
up but I
 
00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
I've seen it that we have never had the
 
00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
information we need yes we've had
 
00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:29.700 align:start position:0%
surfacy stuff
 
00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:31.500 align:start position:0%
but we've never gotten down when I would
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
say an administrator principal uh
 
00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
teacher in the classroom we used to try
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
to analyze our data and we did back then
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
but that was a different state where I
 
00:55:45.049 --> 00:55:45.059 align:start position:0%
was and we take our reading scores we
 
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:46.740 align:start position:0%
look at throw vocabulary we look at
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
comprehension we look at all the
 
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
specific skills and try to dig down and
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
find out is it the program or is it the
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
certain skills which aren't being taught
 
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
that's the type of thing we're going to
 
00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:01.460 align:start position:0%
find out from this extra help here
 
00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
leaving it just innate to do what we're
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
going to struggle we if as the education
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
committees looked at policy and we
 
00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
consider that we've been looking for
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
data to be up on the I platform and it's
 
00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
gradually getting there the I platform
 
00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
it looks at res if you want to research
 
00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
these scores you can go do that now
 
00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
um we would have been able to do that
 
00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
much earlier and in more depths once we
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
if we'd had this person and in the
 
00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
future we will be able to much more uh
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
in a deeper level and better understand
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
the direction we have to really go in
 
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
um I've seen it now for 14 years it's
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
time to really give that support over to
 
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
the department a a department of one
 
00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:48.650 align:start position:0%
the department a a department of one
person

00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
is not enough to analyze data for a
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
hundred and sixty something thousand
 
00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.710 align:start position:0%
hundred and sixty something thousand
students

00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
and we've got trained people out in the
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
field to be able to do that as well
 
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
um so there's a lot to this job the job
 
00:57:04.849 --> 00:57:04.859 align:start position:0%
description is going to be a very
 
00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:06.660 align:start position:0%
difficult one to fill because we're
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
looking for really talented people up in
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
town and person to do this
 
00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:19.380 align:start position:0%
I'll entertain a motion
 
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
motion to reach here to retain Mr chair
 
00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.990 align:start position:0%
motion to reach here to retain Mr chair
okay

00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay

00:57:33.069 --> 00:57:33.079 align:start position:0%
right all those in favor
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
unanimous okay thank you representative
 
00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:37.730 align:start position:0%
unanimous okay thank you representative
Vlad

00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
Vlad
 
00:57:40.609 --> 00:57:40.619 align:start position:0%
well now we'll move on to house bill
 
00:57:40.619 --> 00:57:43.130 align:start position:0%
well now we'll move on to house bill
560.

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
560.
 
00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:45.020 align:start position:0%

00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
is there anyone here that would wants to
 
00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:57.530 --> 00:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
well I think because it has the dollars
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
in it
 
00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
will go down the same path so I'd
 
00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:07.130 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
I should say um I
 
00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
I have motion to retain motion to
 
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
retained by Mary seconded by Kate
 
00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:25.140 align:start position:0%
all right I'm assuming somebody's going
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
hey we'll have somebody new

00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:57.589 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
um

00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
um you heard the governor's presentation
 
00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
the other day we're taking everything on
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
the left base adequacy the four areas to
 
00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:08.940 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid then we're looking at
 
00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:11.220 align:start position:0%
the right hand side of that formula
 
00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:15.980 align:start position:0%
which is complicated and and
 
00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
repetitive in many areas look at the
 
00:59:19.849 --> 00:59:19.859 align:start position:0%
type of Grants we've had we've had
 
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
physical capacity disparity Aid the
 
00:59:24.289 --> 00:59:24.299 align:start position:0%
relief grade the extraordinary needs
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
Grant Aid which uh Senator Aaron
 
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
Hennessy put forth last year in SB 420.
 
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
that came to the committee the education
 
00:59:36.349 --> 00:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
committee for policy we've added in an
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
accountability portion to that where in
 
00:59:41.569 --> 00:59:41.579 align:start position:0%
that accountability portion came out of
 
00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
the recommendations out of the task
 
00:59:45.130 --> 00:59:45.140 align:start position:0%
force in 2018
 
00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:48.660 align:start position:0%
on on looking at extraordinary needs the
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations for having some
 
00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
accountability for Grant monies it also
 
00:59:57.650 --> 00:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
came out of the back in 2008 2009 when
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
Senator Estabrook was developing the
 
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
education funding formula which if we
 
01:00:05.089 --> 01:00:05.099 align:start position:0%
had funded it properly we probably
 
01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be where we are today but that
 
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
also had an accountability measure
 
01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
within it as well so within the
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant you're looking
 
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
at right now that's just one small
 
01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.630 align:start position:0%
at right now that's just one small
component

01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
component
 
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
of what is going to come your way this
 
01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:24.839 align:start position:0%
year turn regarding education funding
 
01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to see HB 540 come to you
 
01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:30.839 align:start position:0%
which is another area differentiated Aid
 
01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
which adds a weighted component into
 
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
that formula as do over 40 States within
 
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
this country we just have one amount of
 
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
money for differentiated Aid right now A
 
01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
little over two thousand dollars that
 
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
weighted formula would you know be at
 
01:00:47.809 --> 01:00:47.819 align:start position:0%
three tiers and we'll explain that when
 
01:00:50.329 --> 01:00:50.339 align:start position:0%
that 540 comes but that could jump the
 
01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
budget by another 10 to 20 million
 
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
dollars it's not an early bill but it is
 
01:00:57.650 --> 01:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
an early bill it's one that they did not
 
01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
Mark as early but there certainly is a
 
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
huge fiscal note to that that bill but
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
this one right here the extraordinary
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
needs Grant is one where we need to
 
01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
pursue this and my suggestion is to to
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
look seriously at what the governor
 
01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
presented a whittling down stabilization
 
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
we need to have
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
if it was my druthers we wouldn't have
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
stabilization in that budget that 150
 
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
million dollars as a result of a budget
 
01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
or a funding formula that doesn't work
 
01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
stabilization was initially put forward
 
01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:34.140 align:start position:0%
as a support for hold harmless in 2008
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
nine when Senator Estabrook had it to
 
01:01:38.809 --> 01:01:38.819 align:start position:0%
hold harmless totaled about 27 million
 
01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:40.339 align:start position:0%
that was it
 
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
then we've gradually tinkered with that
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
and tinkered with it we took out the
 
01:01:46.609 --> 01:01:46.619 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacities severity Aid we took
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
out the monies which are available for
 
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
free and reduced if you had a high
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
percentage of free and reduced kids in
 
01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
your District which is like over 48
 
01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a Manchester now
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
where they would receive twice the base
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
adequacy that was all taken out and we
 
01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
put that 156 million dollars into
 
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.030 align:start position:0%
put that 156 million dollars into
stabilization

01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
stabilization
 
01:02:07.069 --> 01:02:07.079 align:start position:0%
what the governor is proposing is we
 
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
Whittle down the stabilization at the
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
same time grow extraordinary needs
 
01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
grants and that is going to be a real
 
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
trick to do because there's going to be
 
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
some that during this growing period may
 
01:02:20.329 --> 01:02:20.339 align:start position:0%
not receive but we can't continue to
 
01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
fund ghost kids so uh what we are here
 
01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:26.660 align:start position:0%
with the extraordinary needs Grant
 
01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:29.220 align:start position:0%
where that what we added in in policy
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
was simply putting in an accountability
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
measure for the extraordinary needs
 
01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
grant that will require discussion I
 
01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
understand that but it's just part of
 
01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:40.740 align:start position:0%
the larger package which is coming at
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
you in terms of Base adequacy the
 
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
governor jumped that by a thousand
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
dollars per pupil looking at the
 
01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid that was also jumped
 
01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
by the governor in one of those areas
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
and then and then the uh at the areas on
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
the right hand side of the formula which
 
01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
we need to really correct and work on
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
um I would say as I see it this is
 
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
probably close to one of our number one
 
01:03:09.049 --> 01:03:09.059 align:start position:0%
priorities in education to fix this
 
01:03:11.410 --> 01:03:11.420 align:start position:0%
and how we fund education
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of other important needs
 
01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
we looked at some today but this is
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical right here for the
 
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:27.069 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:27.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:31.740 align:start position:0%
representative Vlad I um have to admit
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
that I am really unfamiliar with um sub
 
01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph D of the bill
 
01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to
 
01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:42.140 align:start position:0%
um speaking about
 
01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
unrestricted adequacy funding
 
01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
is is there any way you could kind of
 
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
adequacy funding base adequacy and the
 
01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
four areas of differentiate Aid English
 
01:03:59.930 --> 01:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
language arts free and reduced
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
remedial reading and special education
 
01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:05.339 align:start position:0%
those areas I just mentioned are part of
 
01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
the adequacy formula none of that is
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
restricted for specific use it's you for
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
um as a superintendent you use and
 
01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
School Board use it as you feel
 
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
appropriate to provide the opportunity
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education beyond that we
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
start getting into areas which include
 
01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
the grants
 
01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
those grants are above and beyond and
 
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
you can allocate those resources towards
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
specific areas what we're trying to do
 
01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
though with this one right here
 
01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:41.220 align:start position:0%
in extraordinary needs Grant we passed
 
01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
legislation last year where there is an
 
01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
accountability measure but we found out
 
01:04:47.569 --> 01:04:47.579 align:start position:0%
if a district is receiving less than
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars and we have a
 
01:04:51.049 --> 01:04:51.059 align:start position:0%
number of districts in that
 
01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant we're only
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
receiving maybe a couple thousand three
 
01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:04:58.730 --> 01:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
to have them go through all these hoops
 
01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:00.839 align:start position:0%
of trying to
 
01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
bring somebody in to look at how we're
 
01:05:06.109 --> 01:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
using it trying to identify where we're
 
01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:07.799 align:start position:0%
showing growth or not showing growth
 
01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
submit the paperwork and all that or now
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
online to somebody in doe they're saying
 
01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
you can keep your two or three thousand
 
01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
dollars we don't have the staff to do
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
that it's costing us more to prepare the
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
report that you want than we're
 
01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
receiving in the grant so the report
 
01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:27.059 align:start position:0%
came back from the Department of
 
01:05:29.569 --> 01:05:29.579 align:start position:0%
Education let's have all those that are
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
receiving less than fifty thousand
 
01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
dollars not having to submit that
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
accountability plan and the other
 
01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
thought was to make all this money not
 
01:05:43.549 --> 01:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
restricted to unrestrict this money so
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
it can be used where that District sees
 
01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
fit years ago when we had fiscal
 
01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:50.700 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity Aid that was all
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Monies
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
you could use it where you felt it was
 
01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
necessary to improve your education
 
01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.829 align:start position:0%
necessary to improve your education
foreign

01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair a quick
 
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up to this
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
I was thinking that obviously 50 000 is
 
01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
a reasonably high threshold for
 
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
eliminating reporting I mean
 
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be wouldn't it be fair to say
 
01:06:16.609 --> 01:06:16.619 align:start position:0%
that for a district that receives
 
01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
limited amounts say that five thousand
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
dollars or ballpark that we were talking
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
about that the reporting should be very
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
simple and they shouldn't need all that
 
01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
expertise I mean couldn't we just change
 
01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
the you know reporting needs so
 
01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
everybody can report without being
 
01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
overly burdened but still have some
 
01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:37.140 align:start position:0%
accountability data
 
01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
as we work on this extraordinary needs
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
Grant the extraordinary needs Grant I'm
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
just working on my head right now that
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
was right around 14 point
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
9 14.2 million dollars it goes down to
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
nine point something in the second year
 
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
of the biennium
 
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
we're not talking a significant Dollar
 
01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
in terms of the whole funding formula as
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
we move along and we try to consolidate
 
01:07:07.849 --> 01:07:07.859 align:start position:0%
and it's something that I as a committee
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
would start to look at do we need to
 
01:07:12.589 --> 01:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
have a relief Grant
 
01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
do we need to have a extraordinary needs
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
Grant do we need fiscal capacity
 
01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid when they're all based off
 
01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
of f and R or they're based upon
 
01:07:23.930 --> 01:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
equalized property valuation per pupil
 
01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
should we have one Grant to simplify
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
then if you're going to have more money
 
01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
in that Grant the 50 000 you might find
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
as a threshold that most districts are
 
01:07:37.609 --> 01:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
going to receive a lot more than that
 
01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
depends upon you know where you go with
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
this funding formula so rather than
 
01:07:43.789 --> 01:07:43.799 align:start position:0%
messing with it as a policy committee
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
right now we took the recommendation of
 
01:07:48.049 --> 01:07:48.059 align:start position:0%
doe but knowing that probably
 
01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant will somewhere
 
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the future here it will grow and that
 
01:07:57.529 --> 01:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
might be the singular grant that we have
 
01:08:00.289 --> 01:08:00.299 align:start position:0%
thank you and my original question
 
01:08:03.049 --> 01:08:03.059 align:start position:0%
because this was a follow-up
 
01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
um in regards to the stabilization uh I
 
01:08:08.089 --> 01:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
Aid you said that you are not happy with
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
it what would your personal thoughts be
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
you know as one voice in the State House
 
01:08:16.849 --> 01:08:16.859 align:start position:0%
on how should we handle it stabilization
 
01:08:18.169 --> 01:08:18.179 align:start position:0%
we've tried a lot of different
 
01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:20.100 align:start position:0%
methodologies for reducing enough I
 
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
think some of you might remember the
 
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
four percent deduct each year and at one
 
01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
point we even capped it
 
01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
um which we then had a lawsuit from I
 
01:08:32.570 --> 01:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
won't say the little that the big towns
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
on the southern part of the state on the
 
01:08:37.610 --> 01:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
ocean and we lost that lawsuit
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
um and uh the four percent is since gone
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
because it was not done in this
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
graduated uh it was had the waterfall
 
01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
effect when you went over the cliff you
 
01:08:50.809 --> 01:08:50.819 align:start position:0%
lost significant dollars and of course
 
01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
it's all based upon the previous year
 
01:08:55.309 --> 01:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
and we saw school districts unable to
 
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
plan and their resources properly so
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
um this this process of stabilization is
 
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
something that as a result we have a
 
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
formula that really
 
01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.150 align:start position:0%
formula that really
um

01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.050 align:start position:0%
um
foreign

01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
we're not taking in account the loss of
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
demographic in the state
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
we're funding students that maybe don't
 
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
exist I know and a program that once was
 
01:09:26.769 --> 01:09:26.779 align:start position:0%
um but we also have inflation going on
 
01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
and we as legislature keeps saying you
 
01:09:31.849 --> 01:09:31.859 align:start position:0%
gotta do more
 
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
and and oftentimes not funding it
 
01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
special education it's fed said 40
 
01:09:41.209 --> 01:09:41.219 align:start position:0%
percent we're down what 16 percent uh
 
01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
revenue from them and we're having to
 
01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
pick up the difference there too now so
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
um stabilization needs to go that was a
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation that came out of the
 
01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:58.490 --> 01:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
I was the one but I supported the
 
01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
reduction of the stabilization it came
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
out of the umberger study back in 2018
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
get rid of stabilization
 
01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
direct the money where it needs to be
 
01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:11.150 align:start position:0%
direct the money where it needs to be
directed

01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
directed
 
01:10:14.150 --> 01:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
well I entertained a motion to retain
 
01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
motion to retain thank you Mary do we
 
01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
have a second second by Dan okay all
 
01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:27.780 align:start position:0%
those in favor

uh
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
um accounting unit by accounting unit a
 
02:06:15.649 --> 02:06:15.659 align:start position:0%
summary of what the accomplishments are
 
02:06:19.189 --> 02:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
what they do and then the summary of um
 
02:06:21.470 --> 02:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
you know what the agency's efficiency
 
02:06:24.290 --> 02:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
budget was request was in the governor's
 
02:06:27.709 --> 02:06:27.719 align:start position:0%
request so it's all summarized in a
 
02:06:29.810 --> 02:06:29.820 align:start position:0%
accounting unit by accounting unit uh
 
02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:31.669 align:start position:0%
accounting unit by accounting unit uh
fashion

02:06:31.669 --> 02:06:31.679 align:start position:0%
fashion
 
02:06:33.709 --> 02:06:33.719 align:start position:0%
but for today what I'd like to do is
 
02:06:36.290 --> 02:06:36.300 align:start position:0%
Step you through the presentation that
 
02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
we had put together
 
02:06:40.189 --> 02:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
um and I hope I'll answer most of your
 
02:06:42.169 --> 02:06:42.179 align:start position:0%
questions about our budget to start off
 
02:06:42.179 --> 02:06:43.970 align:start position:0%
questions about our budget to start off
with

02:06:43.970 --> 02:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:06:48.290 --> 02:06:48.300 align:start position:0%
um a very quick uh recap from our
 
02:06:49.490 --> 02:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
previous presentation of the
 
02:06:50.930 --> 02:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
Department's Mission Transportation
 
02:06:53.209 --> 02:06:53.219 align:start position:0%
excellence and enhancing the quality of
 
02:06:55.609 --> 02:06:55.619 align:start position:0%
life in New Hampshire
 
02:06:57.169 --> 02:06:57.179 align:start position:0%
um I won't go through them all again but
 
02:06:58.669 --> 02:06:58.679 align:start position:0%
those are just a reminder some of the
 
02:07:01.010 --> 02:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
key facts of the size and scope of the
 
02:07:02.770 --> 02:07:02.780 align:start position:0%
department Statewide
 
02:07:05.629 --> 02:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
1650 permanent employees
 
02:07:05.639 --> 02:07:06.850 align:start position:0%
1650 permanent employees
21

02:07:06.850 --> 02:07:06.860 align:start position:0%
21
 
02:07:09.109 --> 02:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
59 Bridges
 
02:07:09.119 --> 02:07:09.770 align:start position:0%
59 Bridges
um

02:07:09.770 --> 02:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:14.330 --> 02:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
and about 4 600 miles of roadway that
 
02:07:17.209 --> 02:07:17.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:22.189 --> 02:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
um on slide four is a funding summary of
 
02:07:26.930 --> 02:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
our foi 22 actual expenditures
 
02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
so the actual expenditures for FY 22 are
 
02:07:32.589 --> 02:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
587 million all told for the Department
 
02:07:35.689 --> 02:07:35.699 align:start position:0%
as I've explained previously we tend to
 
02:07:38.990 --> 02:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
break things up uh into two major parts
 
02:07:40.570 --> 02:07:40.580 align:start position:0%
of our
 
02:07:43.070 --> 02:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
budget the municipal Aid and
 
02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
construction portion which is a lot of
 
02:07:46.970 --> 02:07:46.980 align:start position:0%
pass-through funds a lot of our
 
02:07:49.609 --> 02:07:49.619 align:start position:0%
construction program
 
02:07:51.470 --> 02:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
um that was about
 
02:07:54.530 --> 02:07:54.540 align:start position:0%
um 52 of our actual expenditures in FY
 
02:07:57.410 --> 02:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
22 or 305 million dollars
 
02:07:59.270 --> 02:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
and the pied in Orange which is our
 
02:08:00.830 --> 02:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
um which are the operating costs uh for
 
02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
people to work at the department do the
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
jobs that they do uh the actual
 
02:08:09.950 --> 02:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures FY 22 or 282 million
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
dollars or 48 of our budget
 
02:08:15.290 --> 02:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
and again just a summary at the bottom
 
02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
our budget is comprised of
 
02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
multiple funding sources uh in the rough
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
percentages there the highway fund
 
02:08:26.689 --> 02:08:26.699 align:start position:0%
federal funds Turnpike funds other funds
 
02:08:28.550 --> 02:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
and a very small percentage of General
 
02:08:32.209 --> 02:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:32.219 --> 02:08:33.830 align:start position:0%
 
on

02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:08:38.649 --> 02:08:38.659 align:start position:0%
slide or page five and Page Six are a
 
02:08:42.050 --> 02:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
summary of a comparison very high level
 
02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
comparison of the FY 22 budget
 
02:08:48.189 --> 02:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
Appropriations compared to the FY 23
 
02:08:48.199 --> 02:08:49.870 align:start position:0%
Appropriations compared to the FY 23
fy23

02:08:49.870 --> 02:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
fy23
 
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized
 
02:08:54.709 --> 02:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
and then on page six getting to the
 
02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
heart of the matter is the fy24
 
02:08:59.510 --> 02:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget and the
 
02:09:02.510 --> 02:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
fy25 governor's recommended budget so
 
02:09:04.070 --> 02:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
you have those all laid out there for
 
02:09:06.550 --> 02:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
comparison but fy24
 
02:09:09.229 --> 02:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget is
 
02:09:12.649 --> 02:09:12.659 align:start position:0%
about 757 million dollars
 
02:09:12.659 --> 02:09:14.229 align:start position:0%
about 757 million dollars
um

02:09:14.229 --> 02:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:17.629 --> 02:09:17.639 align:start position:0%
and um again in the two parts of the
 
02:09:19.790 --> 02:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
budget that we talk about Municipal Aid
 
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
and construction funds of 415 million
 
02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
dollars or both
 
02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
55 percent of that budget and the
 
02:09:28.070 --> 02:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
operating budget is about
 
02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:28.750 align:start position:0%
operating budget is about
um

02:09:28.750 --> 02:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:32.990 --> 02:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
342 million dollars of 45 of that budget
 
02:09:35.510 --> 02:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to draw your attention to
 
02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:36.770 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to draw your attention to
um

02:09:36.770 --> 02:09:36.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
when you compare say
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
um you know the FY 23 adjusted
 
02:09:44.990 --> 02:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
authorized to the fy24 governance budget
 
02:09:48.109 --> 02:09:48.119 align:start position:0%
and FY 25 budget is that the operating
 
02:09:51.350 --> 02:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
costs are very flat
 
02:09:53.330 --> 02:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
um but that was the budget targets we
 
02:09:55.310 --> 02:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
were given those are the budget targets
 
02:09:58.370 --> 02:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
we had met we had met Municipal Aid and
 
02:10:00.169 --> 02:10:00.179 align:start position:0%
construction fluctuates a little bit
 
02:10:02.930 --> 02:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
with with the amount of federal funds
 
02:10:04.970 --> 02:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
and things that that we get but the
 
02:10:06.589 --> 02:10:06.599 align:start position:0%
operating budgets and the operating
 
02:10:08.149 --> 02:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
costs I want to just draw your attention
 
02:10:10.609 --> 02:10:10.619 align:start position:0%
to those comparisons
 
02:10:12.169 --> 02:10:12.179 align:start position:0%
um very flat
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
um with some very minor
 
02:10:22.850 --> 02:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:26.990 --> 02:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
on page um on page seven of our of this
 
02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:28.729 align:start position:0%
on page um on page seven of our of this
presentation

02:10:28.729 --> 02:10:28.739 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
02:10:28.739 --> 02:10:29.930 align:start position:0%
presentation
um

02:10:29.930 --> 02:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
gives a summary of the
 
02:10:34.609 --> 02:10:34.619 align:start position:0%
um budget in a different format and a
 
02:10:37.490 --> 02:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
bar chart that again compares the 22
 
02:10:40.609 --> 02:10:40.619 align:start position:0%
actual 23 adjusted authorized the 24
 
02:10:43.129 --> 02:10:43.139 align:start position:0%
agency and 24 Governors budget and the
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
25 agency in 25 governance budget
 
02:10:50.570 --> 02:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
um and it Compares them by the mix of
 
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
fundings that we have uh in there with
 
02:10:56.270 --> 02:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
the turnpike funds on top Highway funds
 
02:10:59.209 --> 02:10:59.219 align:start position:0%
uh the maroonish color in the middle
 
02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
General funds is a very very thin sliver
 
02:11:04.550 --> 02:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
of about uh
 
02:11:06.530 --> 02:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
quarter of a percent of our budget in
 
02:11:09.470 --> 02:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
there and uh then other funds in the
 
02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
federal funds that go in to comprise so
 
02:11:13.010 --> 02:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
that gives a very
 
02:11:15.229 --> 02:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
high level snapshot of the funding
 
02:11:19.310 --> 02:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
makeup of our budget request here
 
02:11:23.030 --> 02:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
and on page 8 is just a summary of um
 
02:11:26.089 --> 02:11:26.099 align:start position:0%
over time of the dots
 
02:11:26.099 --> 02:11:27.430 align:start position:0%
over time of the dots
um

02:11:27.430 --> 02:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:30.229 --> 02:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
authorized full-time positions
 
02:11:32.930 --> 02:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
so you'll notice that going back uh
 
02:11:34.810 --> 02:11:34.820 align:start position:0%
roughly 10 years
 
02:11:37.609 --> 02:11:37.619 align:start position:0%
through several budgets through
 
02:11:37.619 --> 02:11:38.350 align:start position:0%
through several budgets through
um

02:11:38.350 --> 02:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:41.290 --> 02:11:41.300 align:start position:0%
2011 through 2014
 
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
there were a number of positions as we
 
02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
Consolidated some Patrol sheds and tried
 
02:11:50.510 --> 02:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
to balance the budget by eliminating a
 
02:11:53.990 --> 02:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
number of positions and since 2014 we've
 
02:11:57.010 --> 02:11:57.020 align:start position:0%
been very flat at about that 1650
 
02:12:00.709 --> 02:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
positions and continue
 
02:12:03.229 --> 02:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
um and I point that out compared to the
 
02:12:07.010 --> 02:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
next slide slide nine which Compares
 
02:12:11.209 --> 02:12:11.219 align:start position:0%
those number of full-time positions
 
02:12:11.219 --> 02:12:12.470 align:start position:0%
those number of full-time positions
with

02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:12:14.990 --> 02:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
um the vehicle miles traveled over time
 
02:12:16.850 --> 02:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
and how they and how the vehicle miles
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
have have increased
 
02:12:19.199 --> 02:12:20.450 align:start position:0%
have have increased
so

02:12:20.450 --> 02:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:20.460 --> 02:12:20.990 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:12:20.990 --> 02:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:22.970 --> 02:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
you can see the red line which is the
 
02:12:25.310 --> 02:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
amount of traffic volume that's using
 
02:12:27.649 --> 02:12:27.659 align:start position:0%
the roadways you see that dip in 2019
 
02:12:30.229 --> 02:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
which was due to covid and how it's
 
02:12:32.570 --> 02:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
rebounding but essentially what I like
 
02:12:36.350 --> 02:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
to to point out with this this
 
02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:37.430 align:start position:0%
to to point out with this this
um

02:12:37.430 --> 02:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:39.649 --> 02:12:39.659 align:start position:0%
slide is that I think the Department of
 
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation is an efficient
 
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
organization we have shown that uh you
 
02:12:46.729 --> 02:12:46.739 align:start position:0%
know we have continued to do more with
 
02:12:46.739 --> 02:12:47.589 align:start position:0%
know we have continued to do more with
less

02:12:47.589 --> 02:12:47.599 align:start position:0%
less
 
02:12:51.589 --> 02:12:51.599 align:start position:0%
this chart does not reflect the current
 
02:12:53.810 --> 02:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate that we are experiencing of
 
02:12:58.189 --> 02:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
around 20 to 25 vacancy rates
 
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
um but we continue to
 
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
um meet our mission
 
02:13:06.050 --> 02:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
um despite that back so I like to point
 
02:13:08.030 --> 02:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
this out because I do believe that dot
 
02:13:09.890 --> 02:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
has shown
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
um that we are an efficient organization
 
02:13:14.689 --> 02:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
doing more with less
 
02:13:14.699 --> 02:13:15.790 align:start position:0%
doing more with less
foreign

02:13:15.790 --> 02:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:13:20.030 --> 02:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh does
 
02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
this mean you have to rely more on
 
02:13:25.910 --> 02:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
contracted labor or contracted trucks or
 
02:13:27.410 --> 02:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any difference
 
02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
it it does thank you for the question
 
02:13:31.430 --> 02:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative Petrie it does make a
 
02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:32.629 align:start position:0%
representative Petrie it does make a
difference

02:13:32.629 --> 02:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:13:34.250 --> 02:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
um particularly this year as we try to
 
02:13:36.770 --> 02:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
compensate for the um
 
02:13:38.750 --> 02:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
for the vacancy rates
 
02:13:41.830 --> 02:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
historically we have always relied on
 
02:13:46.430 --> 02:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
Hyatt plows even even in the pre-2011
 
02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
when we had more more staff we like to
 
02:13:51.890 --> 02:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
say we we are staffed for summer
 
02:13:54.890 --> 02:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
maintenance and we augment our staff
 
02:13:56.689 --> 02:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
with hired plows for the winter
 
02:13:56.699 --> 02:13:57.950 align:start position:0%
with hired plows for the winter
maintenance

02:13:57.950 --> 02:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
02:13:57.960 --> 02:13:59.770 align:start position:0%
maintenance
routinely

02:13:59.770 --> 02:13:59.780 align:start position:0%
routinely
 
02:14:03.290 --> 02:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
follow-up question also your
 
02:14:06.350 --> 02:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
State Prison do you use any labor from
 
02:14:08.030 --> 02:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
the state prison for a cleanup and
 
02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:09.169 align:start position:0%
the state prison for a cleanup and
whatever

02:14:09.169 --> 02:14:09.179 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:14:12.229 --> 02:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
we do have a program where we work with
 
02:14:12.239 --> 02:14:13.069 align:start position:0%
we do have a program where we work with
um

02:14:13.069 --> 02:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:15.530 --> 02:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
02:14:16.910 --> 02:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
trying to think of a nicer way to say
 
02:14:18.589 --> 02:14:18.599 align:start position:0%
than president prison labor but we do
 
02:14:21.530 --> 02:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
have a program uh with the state prison
 
02:14:23.810 --> 02:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
where we have work Crews that help
 
02:14:25.689 --> 02:14:25.699 align:start position:0%
particularly with um
 
02:14:28.189 --> 02:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
interstate and roadside litter cleanup
 
02:14:32.030 --> 02:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to refer to my uh assistant uh
 
02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
oh Dave do you happen to know
 
02:14:43.310 --> 02:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
um yeah we we take about 12 folks on uh
 
02:14:46.550 --> 02:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis throughout the year
 
02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
um at times we've taken more so we have
 
02:14:52.669 --> 02:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
actually four different places that take
 
02:14:55.370 --> 02:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
work Crews at District three office at
 
02:14:58.370 --> 02:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
District Five office takes out Crews to
 
02:15:01.250 --> 02:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
work on the highway fix guide rail do
 
02:15:04.430 --> 02:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
trash removal cutting trees and and so
 
02:15:07.550 --> 02:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
forth abridge maintenance folks take a
 
02:15:10.010 --> 02:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
small crew in the summer to help them
 
02:15:13.129 --> 02:15:13.139 align:start position:0%
wash bridges in our view of traffic take
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
some folks to help with the non-federal
 
02:15:19.490 --> 02:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
funded portion of our pavement marking
 
02:15:22.310 --> 02:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
program but that's become much tougher
 
02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
with us for us since covet so we're
 
02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
still doing that program but it's not as
 
02:15:29.930 --> 02:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
efficient as it was four or five years
 
02:15:32.930 --> 02:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
ago and we'll keep working to make it as
 
02:15:35.149 --> 02:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
efficient as possible so we can make
 
02:15:38.270 --> 02:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
that the best use of of those folks we
 
02:15:40.850 --> 02:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
appreciate their help very much in the
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
cooperation we have from Department of
 
02:15:45.729 --> 02:15:45.739 align:start position:0%
Corrections in that program
 
02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
good thank you so that's a very top
 
02:15:51.649 --> 02:15:51.659 align:start position:0%
level start of our budget presentation
 
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
I'd like to turn it over to Andre Brier
 
02:15:55.550 --> 02:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
who talk about the general fund
 
02:16:01.850 --> 02:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:04.189 --> 02:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee uh
 
02:16:06.229 --> 02:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
again for the record Andre Brier Deputy
 
02:16:08.209 --> 02:16:08.219 align:start position:0%
Commissioner the last time we briefed
 
02:16:10.010 --> 02:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
you I walked you through a little more
 
02:16:12.290 --> 02:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
detail about these programs here I'll
 
02:16:15.290 --> 02:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
just uh say that uh
 
02:16:17.810 --> 02:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
you know the minuscule portion of the
 
02:16:19.370 --> 02:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
budget that is General funded that the
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner referred to is this right
 
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
this is our Personnel operating costs
 
02:16:27.530 --> 02:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
for the Bureau of Aeronautics Rail and
 
02:16:27.540 --> 02:16:28.910 align:start position:0%
for the Bureau of Aeronautics Rail and
Transit

02:16:28.910 --> 02:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
Transit
 
02:16:31.430 --> 02:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
um in all three of these modes you see
 
02:16:34.610 --> 02:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
quite a large pass-through Federal
 
02:16:34.620 --> 02:16:36.290 align:start position:0%
quite a large pass-through Federal
funding

02:16:36.290 --> 02:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:36.910 align:start position:0%
funding
um

02:16:36.910 --> 02:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:40.009 --> 02:16:40.019 align:start position:0%
Dynamic that's all handled by our
 
02:16:43.310 --> 02:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
general funded offices and and Personnel
 
02:16:45.410 --> 02:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
in those offices
 
02:16:48.770 --> 02:16:48.780 align:start position:0%
the next slide you'll see that uh what I
 
02:16:52.129 --> 02:16:52.139 align:start position:0%
just said which is uh primarily Transit
 
02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
is funded by federal funds again federal
 
02:16:55.429 --> 02:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
funds pass through all three of these
 
02:16:55.439 --> 02:16:56.929 align:start position:0%
funds pass through all three of these
modes

02:16:56.929 --> 02:16:56.939 align:start position:0%
modes
 
02:16:56.939 --> 02:16:57.770 align:start position:0%
modes
um

02:16:57.770 --> 02:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
but it is a small proportion there you
 
02:17:02.870 --> 02:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
can see in the FY 2024 general fund
 
02:17:05.270 --> 02:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
budget just 1.6 million will be
 
02:17:07.669 --> 02:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
allocated to uh the division of Aviation
 
02:17:10.730 --> 02:17:10.740 align:start position:0%
or Aeronautics Rail and Transit and fy25
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
just slight uh bump from that that's
 
02:17:16.790 --> 02:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
primarily uh in the benefits lines
 
02:17:19.009 --> 02:17:19.019 align:start position:0%
for our unfunded additional needs I'll
 
02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
only uh point out a couple things here
 
02:17:22.790 --> 02:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
with your Indulgence I would like to
 
02:17:24.410 --> 02:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
talk about the Aeronautics program
 
02:17:26.150 --> 02:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
specialist three position that we
 
02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:27.770 align:start position:0%
specialist three position that we
requested

02:17:27.770 --> 02:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
requested
 
02:17:29.750 --> 02:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
um and the
 
02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
the implications of funding that just in
 
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
general when we do uas drone operations
 
02:17:39.770 --> 02:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
we do it
 
02:17:42.410 --> 02:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
at 18 percent of the cost that it would
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
cost us to contract it out so highly
 
02:17:47.929 --> 02:17:47.939 align:start position:0%
efficient when we do it with uh existing
 
02:17:47.939 --> 02:17:49.389 align:start position:0%
efficient when we do it with uh existing
employees

02:17:49.389 --> 02:17:49.399 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:17:52.910 --> 02:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
the second thing is when we do uas
 
02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:54.950 align:start position:0%
the second thing is when we do uas
survey

02:17:54.950 --> 02:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
survey
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
for for instance a highway project we do
 
02:18:00.709 --> 02:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
it about five times faster than
 
02:18:04.310 --> 02:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
conventional survey methods so I think I
 
02:18:06.110 --> 02:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
I tongue-in-cheek told this committee
 
02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
the last time we were together that that
 
02:18:10.370 --> 02:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
at D.O.T we take pictures of things and
 
02:18:12.310 --> 02:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure not people that is true
 
02:18:14.990 --> 02:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
but this capability is really
 
02:18:17.810 --> 02:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
revolutionary and when you when you uh
 
02:18:20.990 --> 02:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
when you see what's happening Nationwide
 
02:18:23.290 --> 02:18:23.300 align:start position:0%
with Highway projects
 
02:18:27.469 --> 02:18:27.479 align:start position:0%
with airport repaving resurfacing the
 
02:18:30.230 --> 02:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
verification we can do the ensuring of
 
02:18:33.230 --> 02:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
quality of work this more than pays for
 
02:18:35.629 --> 02:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
itself over time
 
02:18:38.570 --> 02:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
so those are those are a couple uh key
 
02:18:41.270 --> 02:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
points there another point I would make
 
02:18:42.950 --> 02:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know various states that we deal
 
02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
with and we're engaged through our TR
 
02:18:51.169 --> 02:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
through our uh trade organizations ashdo
 
02:18:55.310 --> 02:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
um primarily this other states are are
 
02:18:57.889 --> 02:18:57.899 align:start position:0%
fairly far ahead on this and are already
 
02:19:01.370 --> 02:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
realizing quite significant savings
 
02:19:06.530 --> 02:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:08.750 --> 02:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
um realized a 72 percent cost savings
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
over traditional methods and and they've
 
02:19:12.049 --> 02:19:12.059 align:start position:0%
they've had their program for
 
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
significantly longer than us you see uh
 
02:19:17.270 --> 02:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
States like Minnesota that are
 
02:19:19.250 --> 02:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
implementing things called virtual twins
 
02:19:22.549 --> 02:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
that can you can essentially really cut
 
02:19:24.889 --> 02:19:24.899 align:start position:0%
down and do remotely a lot of the
 
02:19:26.570 --> 02:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
inspection work that happens on
 
02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
structures such as Bridges and other
 
02:19:30.830 --> 02:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so quite exciting
 
02:19:32.389 --> 02:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
the last point I'll make with this
 
02:19:35.089 --> 02:19:35.099 align:start position:0%
position is just a comparison in our
 
02:19:39.410 --> 02:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
region right now Vermont similar size
 
02:19:42.290 --> 02:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
similar infrastructure they have six UAV
 
02:19:46.009 --> 02:19:46.019 align:start position:0%
Pilots with additional four to five that
 
02:19:48.490 --> 02:19:48.500 align:start position:0%
they have trained
 
02:19:52.429 --> 02:19:52.439 align:start position:0%
Maine has five UAV Pilots additional
 
02:19:55.250 --> 02:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
five to six trained Connecticut has 17
 
02:19:57.190 --> 02:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
UAV Pilots
 
02:20:01.310 --> 02:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has eight they also quite
 
02:20:03.230 --> 02:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
they extensively use contractors which
 
02:20:04.990 --> 02:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
is why that number's a little smaller
 
02:20:08.090 --> 02:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has one
 
02:20:12.770 --> 02:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
and we have more than one uas so we have
 
02:20:15.170 --> 02:20:15.180 align:start position:0%
more than one platform right now we have
 
02:20:17.389 --> 02:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
two highly capable platforms newly
 
02:20:20.090 --> 02:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
acquired one has lidar capabilities that
 
02:20:22.190 --> 02:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
will significantly improve our ability
 
02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
to support Highway projects we have one
 
02:20:27.170 --> 02:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
operator so one operator can only
 
02:20:30.349 --> 02:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
operate one drone this position will let
 
02:20:33.590 --> 02:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
us significantly expand our support to
 
02:20:37.070 --> 02:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
Highway projects right now the uh the
 
02:20:40.429 --> 02:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
delay that we have on Highway projects
 
02:20:43.790 --> 02:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
goes all so his backlog R1 pilot
 
02:20:46.429 --> 02:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
is all the way back at July 2022. he's
 
02:20:48.770 --> 02:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
the requests that were put in last
 
02:20:50.809 --> 02:20:50.819 align:start position:0%
summer he's just getting to now because
 
02:20:53.570 --> 02:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
of the backlog
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Miss June uh thank
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question on this uh
 
02:21:00.050 --> 02:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
and I was going to ask you about the
 
02:21:02.750 --> 02:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
lidar can you do survey work
 
02:21:04.849 --> 02:21:04.859 align:start position:0%
would that would that lidar which how
 
02:21:07.490 --> 02:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
much does that save and uh oh it's a
 
02:21:09.889 --> 02:21:09.899 align:start position:0%
tremendous so that that goes into the
 
02:21:12.170 --> 02:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
overall cost savings when I say we do it
 
02:21:15.770 --> 02:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
about you know uh at about 18 percent of
 
02:21:17.630 --> 02:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
the cost of contractors that that's
 
02:21:19.309 --> 02:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
going to save a lot
 
02:21:22.370 --> 02:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
um we were uh we were able to give a
 
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
presentation to governor and Council uh
 
02:21:26.090 --> 02:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
last summer beginning of last summer
 
02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
where we kind of rolled through how we
 
02:21:30.530 --> 02:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
deploy this technology on uh in this
 
02:21:32.690 --> 02:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
case it was an airport project
 
02:21:35.929 --> 02:21:35.939 align:start position:0%
and it pretty much wowed everybody
 
02:21:38.809 --> 02:21:38.819 align:start position:0%
um I think uh several counselors noted
 
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
publicly at the time that uh they were
 
02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
quite impressed with the capability and
 
02:21:45.050 --> 02:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
it's quality control too so we can check
 
02:21:47.210 --> 02:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
on our contractors and verify their work
 
02:21:49.370 --> 02:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
as being done properly through things
 
02:21:51.170 --> 02:21:51.180 align:start position:0%
like thermal imagery
 
02:21:53.690 --> 02:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
so we can verify that as they lay down
 
02:21:57.530 --> 02:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
tarmac the seams are correct right a
 
02:21:59.150 --> 02:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
little hard to check from the naked eye
 
02:22:02.570 --> 02:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
but a lot of capability implicit in this
 
02:22:05.389 --> 02:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
in this system
 
02:22:07.790 --> 02:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
thank you with regards to the other
 
02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
states and also what you're envisioning
 
02:22:10.730 --> 02:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are these full-time
 
02:22:13.490 --> 02:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
positions yeah so the other states when
 
02:22:16.610 --> 02:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
I mentioned uh this so six for Vermont
 
02:22:19.070 --> 02:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
eight for Massachusetts five for Maine
 
02:22:21.469 --> 02:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
17 for Connecticut those are the full
 
02:22:23.630 --> 02:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
time they have other
 
02:22:26.389 --> 02:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
um positions trained and and just to be
 
02:22:29.510 --> 02:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
completely up front my vision as this is
 
02:22:31.490 --> 02:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
under my portfolio is not to keep
 
02:22:33.530 --> 02:22:33.540 align:start position:0%
growing our Bureau of Aeronautics we're
 
02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
not going to be adding positions
 
02:22:38.809 --> 02:22:38.819 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly or uh even significantly in
 
02:22:41.510 --> 02:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
the future I think the future of our uas
 
02:22:45.650 --> 02:22:45.660 align:start position:0%
program is to train and cross-train our
 
02:22:48.110 --> 02:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
existing employees to be able to operate
 
02:22:50.450 --> 02:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
these especially some of our uh
 
02:22:52.130 --> 02:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
individuals that have volunteered to do
 
02:22:54.230 --> 02:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
this in our Bureau of bridge maintenance
 
02:22:54.240 --> 02:22:55.790 align:start position:0%
this in our Bureau of bridge maintenance
and

02:22:55.790 --> 02:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:00.290 --> 02:23:00.300 align:start position:0%
um in our operations uh uh division so
 
02:23:03.050 --> 02:23:03.060 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're the state of New
 
02:23:04.790 --> 02:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're Frugal my vision for
 
02:23:07.550 --> 02:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
this program Frugal but effective so I
 
02:23:10.490 --> 02:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
think with these two drone operators one
 
02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
of them can always act in a training
 
02:23:14.030 --> 02:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
capacity as we build that capability out
 
02:23:16.730 --> 02:23:16.740 align:start position:0%
with our existing Workforce very
 
02:23:18.650 --> 02:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
difficult to do with one because he's
 
02:23:20.990 --> 02:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
trying to juggle projects and
 
02:23:23.330 --> 02:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
and like I said his backlog is is over
 
02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
six months right now
 
02:23:26.870 --> 02:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
do you have asked
 
02:23:30.410 --> 02:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
estrogen do you have an estimate of cost
 
02:23:33.349 --> 02:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
for these two items actually the
 
02:23:35.030 --> 02:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
unfunded additional needs that you'd
 
02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:36.230 align:start position:0%
unfunded additional needs that you'd
like

02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:23:38.150 --> 02:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
02:23:40.370 --> 02:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
it's about a hundred thousand dollars a
 
02:23:41.630 --> 02:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand about a hundred
 
02:23:43.010 --> 02:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for the position right
 
02:23:45.349 --> 02:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah well and and the uh
 
02:23:48.349 --> 02:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
Transit as well the transit need
 
02:23:49.790 --> 02:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
um do you want me to talk today I
 
02:23:50.809 --> 02:23:50.819 align:start position:0%
normally I want to speak to that too
 
02:23:53.630 --> 02:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so I do I uh with with that
 
02:23:55.610 --> 02:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
physician as the commissioner said about
 
02:23:57.230 --> 02:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
about a hundred
 
02:23:57.240 --> 02:23:57.950 align:start position:0%
about a hundred
um

02:23:57.950 --> 02:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:01.849 --> 02:24:01.859 align:start position:0%
the the other unfunded requirement is
 
02:24:03.650 --> 02:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
the state operating match for rural and
 
02:24:06.410 --> 02:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
urban transit to access additional
 
02:24:09.290 --> 02:24:09.300 align:start position:0%
available iija funds now we put put that
 
02:24:12.410 --> 02:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
in as a as a request
 
02:24:14.690 --> 02:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
um as an additional need with the
 
02:24:16.849 --> 02:24:16.859 align:start position:0%
anticipation of Greater federal funds so
 
02:24:18.889 --> 02:24:18.899 align:start position:0%
we could access those
 
02:24:18.899 --> 02:24:20.770 align:start position:0%
we could access those
um

02:24:20.770 --> 02:24:20.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
because that didn't make it into the
 
02:24:25.309 --> 02:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
02:24:28.610 --> 02:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
um there's we put this on here so we
 
02:24:30.290 --> 02:24:30.300 align:start position:0%
could more or less
 
02:24:33.050 --> 02:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
um just point out that there are
 
02:24:34.969 --> 02:24:34.979 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the advocacy
 
02:24:37.150 --> 02:24:37.160 align:start position:0%
community that are going to be
 
02:24:40.130 --> 02:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
testifying during during budget hearings
 
02:24:42.410 --> 02:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
as to what they would do with this need
 
02:24:44.990 --> 02:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
we have a a whole laundry list that the
 
02:24:47.150 --> 02:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh that the transit providers provided
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
us as to what they could do with various
 
02:24:52.010 --> 02:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
funding levels what happens if they
 
02:24:53.870 --> 02:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
don't get these matching funds and
 
02:24:56.090 --> 02:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
really when it boils down
 
02:24:57.950 --> 02:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
is if they don't have these matching
 
02:24:59.690 --> 02:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
phones just limits the availability of
 
02:25:03.469 --> 02:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:06.889 --> 02:25:06.899 align:start position:0%
so um oh I'm sorry based on what you
 
02:25:08.090 --> 02:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
just said
 
02:25:08.100 --> 02:25:09.830 align:start position:0%
just said
um

02:25:09.830 --> 02:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
so by not investing
 
02:25:16.309 --> 02:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
there are a large number of federal
 
02:25:18.650 --> 02:25:18.660 align:start position:0%
dollars that we're losing is that what
 
02:25:20.809 --> 02:25:20.819 align:start position:0%
you mean that we have the potential that
 
02:25:22.370 --> 02:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
we would that we would leave those on
 
02:25:24.530 --> 02:25:24.540 align:start position:0%
the table all right thank you typically
 
02:25:27.889 --> 02:25:27.899 align:start position:0%
you know typically these are um
 
02:25:30.230 --> 02:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
um you know rural and urban Transit
 
02:25:32.330 --> 02:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
facilities State of New Hampshire we
 
02:25:34.190 --> 02:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
have historically provided very little
 
02:25:37.070 --> 02:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
funding to assist with their with their
 
02:25:39.950 --> 02:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
matching costs so the majority of the of
 
02:25:43.550 --> 02:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
of of the required matching funding
 
02:25:45.950 --> 02:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
which is generally about 50 percent for
 
02:25:48.349 --> 02:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
the operating cost falls on the
 
02:25:50.150 --> 02:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities and they have advocated
 
02:25:55.070 --> 02:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
for a greater role of the state in
 
02:25:59.150 --> 02:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
helping to fund uh public transit so
 
02:26:01.690 --> 02:26:01.700 align:start position:0%
um with the Advent of the additional
 
02:26:03.790 --> 02:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
iija funds
 
02:26:06.110 --> 02:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
in our additional needs we had
 
02:26:08.570 --> 02:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
recognized you know
 
02:26:10.550 --> 02:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
proportionally the you know the amount
 
02:26:14.570 --> 02:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
of additional federal funds you know an
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
argument could be made to come with with
 
02:26:19.070 --> 02:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
an additional level of uh State matching
 
02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
funds um at the end of the at the end of
 
02:26:23.389 --> 02:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
the budget it wasn't included it was one
 
02:26:25.429 --> 02:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
of the additional needs that we had had
 
02:26:27.830 --> 02:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
pointed out uh because of the increase
 
02:26:29.750 --> 02:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
in federal funds
 
02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:31.130 align:start position:0%
in federal funds
um

02:26:31.130 --> 02:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:34.370 --> 02:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
but I'm but I'm sure through the budget
 
02:26:37.550 --> 02:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
process the transit providers you may be
 
02:26:38.690 --> 02:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
hearing with them so that's why we
 
02:26:40.370 --> 02:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
wanted to just make sure you understood
 
02:26:43.929 --> 02:26:43.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:46.490 --> 02:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
so you don't have a recommended amount
 
02:26:49.070 --> 02:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
you'd like to put here we will wait and
 
02:26:51.590 --> 02:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
see what the um those who are coming to
 
02:26:54.110 --> 02:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
testify will say we had a we had a
 
02:26:56.809 --> 02:26:56.819 align:start position:0%
recommended amount in our in our agency
 
02:26:58.730 --> 02:26:58.740 align:start position:0%
budget request could you just tell me
 
02:27:00.530 --> 02:27:00.540 align:start position:0%
what it is it was around 100 it was
 
02:27:02.270 --> 02:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
around fifty five hundred thousand
 
02:27:05.450 --> 02:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
dollars in FY 24 and around 1.6 million
 
02:27:08.809 --> 02:27:08.819 align:start position:0%
dollars in FY 25. and that was
 
02:27:10.670 --> 02:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
proportional that wasn't the total match
 
02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
I know you you probably hear from the
 
02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
transit advisors that they that there's
 
02:27:17.330 --> 02:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
a there's even a greater need than than
 
02:27:19.070 --> 02:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
we had identified but our additional
 
02:27:23.090 --> 02:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
needs had identified you know a um
 
02:27:26.450 --> 02:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
a level commence commensurate with the
 
02:27:28.730 --> 02:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
additional Federal funding and and that
 
02:27:30.290 --> 02:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
was proportional but like the
 
02:27:32.450 --> 02:27:32.460 align:start position:0%
commissioner said when the transit
 
02:27:34.610 --> 02:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
providers come they're going to most
 
02:27:36.770 --> 02:27:36.780 align:start position:0%
likely make a case for significantly
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
more than yeah I I met with one of the
 
02:27:42.170 --> 02:27:42.180 align:start position:0%
transit providers and they they're
 
02:27:43.849 --> 02:27:43.859 align:start position:0%
getting kind of squeezed from the fits
 
02:27:45.650 --> 02:27:45.660 align:start position:0%
yeah because they're required to do
 
02:27:48.469 --> 02:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
certain things that they're not fully
 
02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
compensated for so the the better they
 
02:27:52.250 --> 02:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
do the federal things the worse off they
 
02:27:54.290 --> 02:27:54.300 align:start position:0%
are all right so it's kind of you know
 
02:27:56.150 --> 02:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
kind of inverse for the state's benefit
 
02:27:59.690 --> 02:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
Mary I remember Victoria Sheen when she
 
02:28:02.270 --> 02:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
was here she spoke at length about the
 
02:28:06.950 --> 02:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
need for us to demonstrate more support
 
02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
um so that we could drive more federal
 
02:28:09.889 --> 02:28:09.899 align:start position:0%
dollars so I think that's something we
 
02:28:14.510 --> 02:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:17.750 --> 02:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair a lot of us are upset
 
02:28:19.130 --> 02:28:19.140 align:start position:0%
over the fact that many people going
 
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
down the roads don't pay their share and
 
02:28:25.010 --> 02:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
gas tax and I wonder if you could help
 
02:28:27.490 --> 02:28:27.500 align:start position:0%
us with telling us maybe through the DMV
 
02:28:30.830 --> 02:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
how many electric cars there are a
 
02:28:33.290 --> 02:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
multi-fueled thing so we can kind of get
 
02:28:35.030 --> 02:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
that out there the next time we try to
 
02:28:37.130 --> 02:28:37.140 align:start position:0%
pass something to get those people to
 
02:28:42.530 --> 02:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
pay some share of of the road toll sure
 
02:28:43.969 --> 02:28:43.979 align:start position:0%
um I don't have that information on the
 
02:28:45.770 --> 02:28:45.780 align:start position:0%
tip of my tongue I know you wouldn't but
 
02:28:47.809 --> 02:28:47.819 align:start position:0%
I think if you can get it to us sure
 
02:28:50.270 --> 02:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
yeah next year we we put in a bill and
 
02:28:52.250 --> 02:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
so I said oh what do we need that for
 
02:28:53.990 --> 02:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know we can see
 
02:28:55.969 --> 02:28:55.979 align:start position:0%
twenty percent of the cars are not
 
02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
paying anything
 
02:28:59.450 --> 02:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
and the electric cars that put an extra
 
02:29:01.849 --> 02:29:01.859 align:start position:0%
thousand pounds of battery on the road
 
02:29:04.130 --> 02:29:04.140 align:start position:0%
and wearing it out even more versus the
 
02:29:06.530 --> 02:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
80 pounds of gasoline I drive down the
 
02:29:09.110 --> 02:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
road so yeah current registration
 
02:29:10.610 --> 02:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
um of electric vehicles as the
 
02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner said we get you an exact
 
02:29:14.150 --> 02:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
number that's always growing
 
02:29:17.150 --> 02:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
um you hear 8 000 kicked around but
 
02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
that's growing constantly yeah and and
 
02:29:21.650 --> 02:29:21.660 align:start position:0%
the other the ones that have kind of
 
02:29:23.630 --> 02:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
multi-fuel that they might run on
 
02:29:26.809 --> 02:29:26.819 align:start position:0%
propane or something like other or you
 
02:29:28.190 --> 02:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
know those those are people that aren't
 
02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
paying at gasoline tax yeah and I know
 
02:29:32.210 --> 02:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
there are several bills through the
 
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
legislation this time you probably have
 
02:29:36.309 --> 02:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
seen are following them that um
 
02:29:36.319 --> 02:29:38.030 align:start position:0%
seen are following them that um
uh

02:29:38.030 --> 02:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:29:40.190 --> 02:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
attempt to address part of part of part
 
02:29:41.809 --> 02:29:41.819 align:start position:0%
of the issue you've testified at a
 
02:29:43.610 --> 02:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
couple of them so yeah yeah it's it's
 
02:29:45.410 --> 02:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
one thing to say yeah they're riding
 
02:29:46.969 --> 02:29:46.979 align:start position:0%
free but when they put an extra thousand
 
02:29:48.650 --> 02:29:48.660 align:start position:0%
pounds on the road
 
02:29:51.230 --> 02:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
in battery you know that's that's even
 
02:29:54.830 --> 02:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
more aware that just a regular car so I
 
02:29:57.410 --> 02:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
think if we know those data we can start
 
02:30:00.590 --> 02:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
making a fuss yeah thank you sir that's
 
02:30:02.950 --> 02:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
the long-term
 
02:30:05.570 --> 02:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
negative forecast for for the highway
 
02:30:08.450 --> 02:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
fund is also LinkedIn
 
02:30:11.030 --> 02:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
yeah can you just tell me what iija
 
02:30:14.710 --> 02:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
stands for I'm sorry it was the uh
 
02:30:18.410 --> 02:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
infrastructure something I J Investment
 
02:30:20.270 --> 02:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
in jobs active investment in jobs act
 
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah you caught me up guys
 
02:30:23.809 --> 02:30:23.819 align:start position:0%
you'll hear it called iija
 
02:30:28.250 --> 02:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:31.190 --> 02:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure investment and jobs Act
 
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
the bipartisan infrastructure law bill
 
02:30:36.889 --> 02:30:36.899 align:start position:0%
is the way some people refer to it as
 
02:30:36.899 --> 02:30:37.550 align:start position:0%
is the way some people refer to it as
well

02:30:37.550 --> 02:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:30:39.710 --> 02:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
and I apologize I had it on the tip of
 
02:30:41.570 --> 02:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
my tongue last year at this time when it
 
02:30:44.630 --> 02:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
was when it was new and stuff but I just
 
02:30:47.389 --> 02:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
want to back up one just for a second uh
 
02:30:48.830 --> 02:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
in full Finance
 
02:30:52.809 --> 02:30:52.819 align:start position:0%
last term we talked about uas
 
02:30:55.610 --> 02:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
deployment around the state not just
 
02:30:57.770 --> 02:30:57.780 align:start position:0%
Transportation but we had also safety
 
02:30:59.090 --> 02:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
and we had
 
02:31:00.830 --> 02:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know who all were we had
 
02:31:03.590 --> 02:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
multiple divisions or multiple agencies
 
02:31:06.590 --> 02:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
that were doing this and at that time it
 
02:31:09.650 --> 02:31:09.660 align:start position:0%
was just rhetorical discussion is there
 
02:31:12.650 --> 02:31:12.660 align:start position:0%
like a central uas
 
02:31:15.650 --> 02:31:15.660 align:start position:0%
Nexus somewhere that we you know you can
 
02:31:17.270 --> 02:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
get some cross training and different
 
02:31:19.130 --> 02:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
disciplines from different departments
 
02:31:21.349 --> 02:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
or whatever I don't even understand the
 
02:31:23.150 --> 02:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
whole thing but yeah that's a that's a
 
02:31:24.469 --> 02:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
great question
 
02:31:27.349 --> 02:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
um through uh
 
02:31:30.110 --> 02:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
through governor and Council
 
02:31:30.120 --> 02:31:30.950 align:start position:0%
through governor and Council
um

02:31:30.950 --> 02:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:33.889 --> 02:31:33.899 align:start position:0%
we did we have a current contract for
 
02:31:37.370 --> 02:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
about 167 thousand dollars that's being
 
02:31:40.610 --> 02:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
used to fund a
 
02:31:43.190 --> 02:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
a more wide-ranging look at how we
 
02:31:47.389 --> 02:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
Implement our uas program how we best
 
02:31:49.730 --> 02:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
and most efficiently deploy those assets
 
02:31:51.530 --> 02:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
into the future so that's an ongoing
 
02:31:54.110 --> 02:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
effort right now that was funded last
 
02:31:54.120 --> 02:31:55.370 align:start position:0%
effort right now that was funded last
year

02:31:55.370 --> 02:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:31:55.380 --> 02:31:56.349 align:start position:0%
year
um

02:31:56.349 --> 02:31:56.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:00.530 --> 02:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
or is we the state so so we as in dot
 
02:32:02.990 --> 02:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
okay now our relationship with the
 
02:32:04.429 --> 02:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and other
 
02:32:07.790 --> 02:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
departments that use uas's we have a
 
02:32:09.410 --> 02:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
very close working relationship with
 
02:32:12.050 --> 02:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
those departments fundamentally
 
02:32:15.170 --> 02:32:15.180 align:start position:0%
it is a different Mission set so I'm a
 
02:32:17.150 --> 02:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
former Air Force pilot it's it's
 
02:32:18.770 --> 02:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
analogous to
 
02:32:20.809 --> 02:32:20.819 align:start position:0%
you know to uh
 
02:32:24.290 --> 02:32:24.300 align:start position:0%
uh transport flying versus you know
 
02:32:27.710 --> 02:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
fighter combat operations versus close
 
02:32:29.690 --> 02:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
air support these are fundamentally
 
02:32:31.550 --> 02:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
different missions the law enforcement
 
02:32:35.270 --> 02:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
uas mission is something that is quite
 
02:32:37.730 --> 02:32:37.740 align:start position:0%
unique and has its own training
 
02:32:40.490 --> 02:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
requirements on its own limitations
 
02:32:43.070 --> 02:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's not certainly not the type of U.S
 
02:32:43.080 --> 02:32:44.090 align:start position:0%
that's not certainly not the type of U.S
flying

02:32:44.090 --> 02:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
flying
 
02:32:46.370 --> 02:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
that we would be involved with ours is
 
02:32:49.429 --> 02:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
really focused on infrastructure
 
02:32:52.370 --> 02:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
we're not chasing anything we're
 
02:32:55.250 --> 02:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
loitering and we're taking pictures you
 
02:32:57.590 --> 02:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
know so but but we are closely aligned
 
02:32:59.510 --> 02:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
and constantly
 
02:33:01.130 --> 02:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
um coordinating with the other
 
02:33:03.650 --> 02:33:03.660 align:start position:0%
departments and I think also to some
 
02:33:07.070 --> 02:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
degree Bureau of Aeronautics has kind of
 
02:33:08.990 --> 02:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
they did jurisdictional oversight over
 
02:33:10.790 --> 02:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
some of the administration of that too
 
02:33:13.790 --> 02:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
yeah by Statute
 
02:33:15.950 --> 02:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
um we are the lead agency uh the Bureau
 
02:33:18.110 --> 02:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
of Aeronautics on uas capabilities
 
02:33:20.809 --> 02:33:20.819 align:start position:0%
having said that we give great deference
 
02:33:23.330 --> 02:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
to uh to our law enforcement Partners
 
02:33:26.929 --> 02:33:26.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:30.410 --> 02:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
foreign that's so that's uh that's the
 
02:33:32.270 --> 02:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
summary of our general fund portion so
 
02:33:35.090 --> 02:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
the two takeaways are of that are
 
02:33:37.070 --> 02:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
um that you will be hearing we've talked
 
02:33:38.990 --> 02:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
about the transit need
 
02:33:43.429 --> 02:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
um as well as the um additional position
 
02:33:46.490 --> 02:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
um just to uh support the uas program
 
02:33:49.370 --> 02:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
and again we identified that as a
 
02:33:51.469 --> 02:33:51.479 align:start position:0%
um as a as a what feels an efficiency
 
02:33:53.870 --> 02:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
and and Innovation but we certainly
 
02:33:55.550 --> 02:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
02:33:55.560 --> 02:33:58.670 align:start position:0%
understand the
um

02:33:58.670 --> 02:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:01.490 --> 02:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
the hesitancy in in terms of growing
 
02:34:03.110 --> 02:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
state government and stuff but it does
 
02:34:05.210 --> 02:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
it does I think Andre had done a good
 
02:34:08.090 --> 02:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
job identifying that
 
02:34:11.570 --> 02:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
um it is it is it is and could be an
 
02:34:13.250 --> 02:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
efficiency in terms of paying for itself
 
02:34:14.809 --> 02:34:14.819 align:start position:0%
over the long term
 
02:34:16.969 --> 02:34:16.979 align:start position:0%
so with that I'd like to turn to oh I'm
 
02:34:19.790 --> 02:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
sorry I I had uh one question uh whether
 
02:34:21.650 --> 02:34:21.660 align:start position:0%
the with the rate of inflation that we
 
02:34:24.530 --> 02:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
have how much is that affecting your
 
02:34:26.090 --> 02:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
Bridge Building
 
02:34:28.849 --> 02:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
portion I mean is it in it and we know
 
02:34:30.889 --> 02:34:30.899 align:start position:0%
it's not linear because some things are
 
02:34:32.690 --> 02:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
costing a heck of a lot more
 
02:34:35.150 --> 02:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
you know and how much effect does that
 
02:34:37.550 --> 02:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
have on what you're doing
 
02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:38.809 align:start position:0%
have on what you're doing
um

02:34:38.809 --> 02:34:38.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:41.870 --> 02:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's it is having it is having an effect
 
02:34:43.969 --> 02:34:43.979 align:start position:0%
uh we've been
 
02:34:46.790 --> 02:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
um but hopefully it's somewhat um
 
02:34:49.130 --> 02:34:49.140 align:start position:0%
stabilizing but we've seen costs
 
02:34:51.830 --> 02:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
compared to what we had budgeted or
 
02:34:53.809 --> 02:34:53.819 align:start position:0%
planned on we've seen costs escalation
 
02:34:58.730 --> 02:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
of of 15 to 20 percent so in a holistic
 
02:35:01.490 --> 02:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
type of look that would be 15 or 20
 
02:35:01.500 --> 02:35:02.450 align:start position:0%
type of look that would be 15 or 20
percent

02:35:02.450 --> 02:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:35:05.270 --> 02:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
um less work that we would be doing
 
02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
um I spoke about uh the uh
 
02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Act and the additional
 
02:35:10.910 --> 02:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
Federal funding that we got so New
 
02:35:13.010 --> 02:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire got about
 
02:35:13.020 --> 02:35:13.969 align:start position:0%
Hampshire got about
um

02:35:13.969 --> 02:35:13.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:17.570 --> 02:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
about 25 additional Federal funding than
 
02:35:21.469 --> 02:35:21.479 align:start position:0%
we had previously uh to that bill
 
02:35:23.570 --> 02:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
um it came with a lot of expectations of
 
02:35:23.580 --> 02:35:24.590 align:start position:0%
um it came with a lot of expectations of
of

02:35:24.590 --> 02:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:35:28.370 --> 02:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
um of uh more work being done
 
02:35:30.349 --> 02:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
um we are finding that with the rate of
 
02:35:33.050 --> 02:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
inflation that um it's it's allowing us
 
02:35:33.060 --> 02:35:34.490 align:start position:0%
inflation that um it's it's allowing us
to

02:35:34.490 --> 02:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:35:37.309 --> 02:35:37.319 align:start position:0%
um essentially sustain the the program
 
02:35:41.870 --> 02:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
and absorb those uh inflationary impacts
 
02:35:41.880 --> 02:35:42.770 align:start position:0%
and absorb those uh inflationary impacts
um

02:35:42.770 --> 02:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:45.830 --> 02:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily putting out a whole
 
02:35:48.110 --> 02:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
lot more projects so in a nutshell
 
02:35:50.210 --> 02:35:50.220 align:start position:0%
that's kind of been the impact of the
 
02:35:51.710 --> 02:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
inflation that we've seen over the last
 
02:35:51.720 --> 02:35:54.410 align:start position:0%
inflation that we've seen over the last
year

02:35:54.410 --> 02:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:56.170 --> 02:35:56.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:35:58.849 --> 02:35:58.859 align:start position:0%
so with that we'll turn to
 
02:36:02.210 --> 02:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
um slide 12 and Dave rodrigue the
 
02:36:03.469 --> 02:36:03.479 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner is going to talk
 
02:36:05.510 --> 02:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
about the turnpike fund portion of our
 
02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:08.830 align:start position:0%
about the turnpike fund portion of our
budget

02:36:08.830 --> 02:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:12.050 --> 02:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner Mr chairman and
 
02:36:13.610 --> 02:36:13.620 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
02:36:15.590 --> 02:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
my name is David rodrigue assistant
 
02:36:18.349 --> 02:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner for DOT
 
02:36:20.929 --> 02:36:20.939 align:start position:0%
um back on the turnpike system the
 
02:36:25.130 --> 02:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
turnpike system is a concise part of our
 
02:36:27.650 --> 02:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
transportation system it's well defined
 
02:36:32.210 --> 02:36:32.220 align:start position:0%
it includes three segments I-95 from the
 
02:36:34.550 --> 02:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts border to the main border
 
02:36:37.849 --> 02:36:37.859 align:start position:0%
the Spalding turnpike from its Terminus
 
02:36:41.630 --> 02:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
at I-95 North to the Milton Wakefield
 
02:36:45.410 --> 02:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
Town Line or so in the Effie Everett
 
02:36:48.410 --> 02:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
from Nashua continuing up through
 
02:36:52.550 --> 02:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester and joining I-93 and ending
 
02:36:55.670 --> 02:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
here in Concord so those three segments
 
02:36:59.990 --> 02:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
include about 89 miles of of highway 172
 
02:37:03.889 --> 02:37:03.899 align:start position:0%
Bridges seven toll plazas we Define the
 
02:37:06.349 --> 02:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
turnpike system as an Enterprise fund
 
02:37:09.290 --> 02:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
meaning all funds elected through the
 
02:37:11.770 --> 02:37:11.780 align:start position:0%
tolls must stay on the turnpike system
 
02:37:15.770 --> 02:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
those funds go for our operating and
 
02:37:19.429 --> 02:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs a Debt Service our our
 
02:37:22.670 --> 02:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
in our work and a Capital Improvements
 
02:37:27.530 --> 02:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 22 we processed about 112
 
02:37:29.990 --> 02:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
million transactions
 
02:37:31.210 --> 02:37:31.220 align:start position:0%
um for
 
02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
143.8 million dollars of total revenue
 
02:37:39.710 --> 02:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
on the next slide you'll see the
 
02:37:41.750 --> 02:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
um history of the turnpike Revenue
 
02:37:45.889 --> 02:37:45.899 align:start position:0%
you'll see that in 2019 we thought
 
02:37:48.410 --> 02:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
things were looking great and revenues
 
02:37:51.290 --> 02:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
were increasing and we all know what
 
02:37:53.929 --> 02:37:53.939 align:start position:0%
happened then at the end of
 
02:37:57.590 --> 02:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
um fiscal year 20 I guess
 
02:38:02.030 --> 02:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
um when everything changed we saw some a
 
02:38:04.910 --> 02:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
significant decline in Revenue we've
 
02:38:08.030 --> 02:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
seen a little bit of a bounce back from
 
02:38:11.510 --> 02:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
that and we have Consultants who look at
 
02:38:14.330 --> 02:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
our transportation system and look at
 
02:38:17.990 --> 02:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
economic factors around the country and
 
02:38:21.889 --> 02:38:21.899 align:start position:0%
people's commuting habits and what
 
02:38:24.830 --> 02:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
they're telling us now is they think
 
02:38:28.250 --> 02:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
we've seen most of the recovery
 
02:38:30.830 --> 02:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
um from covid in that bottom line
 
02:38:33.710 --> 02:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
people's traveling habits and commuting
 
02:38:37.010 --> 02:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
habits especially have changed uh a
 
02:38:39.650 --> 02:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
little bit so as we look to the Future
 
02:38:42.950 --> 02:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
we're seeing just stay or projecting
 
02:38:46.550 --> 02:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
just a modest increase in traffic
 
02:38:50.210 --> 02:38:50.220 align:start position:0%
volumes that relate directly to
 
02:38:53.870 --> 02:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
um revenue for for the turnpike system
 
02:38:57.230 --> 02:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
um so again we're looking at at
 
02:38:59.510 --> 02:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
um funding being flat for the future
 
02:39:03.349 --> 02:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the turnpike budget we
 
02:39:05.889 --> 02:39:05.899 align:start position:0%
did not have a additional prior
 
02:39:08.870 --> 02:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs but because we have
 
02:39:11.570 --> 02:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
Bonds on the turnpike system they're
 
02:39:14.389 --> 02:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
very specific in what we do first and
 
02:39:16.610 --> 02:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
it's no surprise the very first thing we
 
02:39:19.010 --> 02:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
do is collect the money you got to do
 
02:39:22.250 --> 02:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
that first then then you got to operate
 
02:39:25.190 --> 02:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
and maintain the system and then we have
 
02:39:28.010 --> 02:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
to do our maintenance in what comes last
 
02:39:31.610 --> 02:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
is our Capital project so we have a
 
02:39:34.190 --> 02:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
number of capital projects that we're
 
02:39:36.590 --> 02:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
working on that that are funded with
 
02:39:38.450 --> 02:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
Turnpike funds
 
02:39:42.650 --> 02:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
um most notably we have the general
 
02:39:45.590 --> 02:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
Sullivan bridge will be replacing we
 
02:39:49.010 --> 02:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
have the Epi Everett widening that goes
 
02:39:52.969 --> 02:39:52.979 align:start position:0%
from Nashua to to Manchester we have
 
02:39:56.510 --> 02:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
exit six and seven in Manchester that we
 
02:39:59.150 --> 02:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
would like to reconstruct and we have
 
02:40:03.110 --> 02:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
Beau conquered I-93 a large portion of
 
02:40:05.570 --> 02:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
that here is funded with Turnpike
 
02:40:08.150 --> 02:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
dollars so as we look at our Capital
 
02:40:11.270 --> 02:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
program we're seeing those projects
 
02:40:15.349 --> 02:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
being pushed out later and later
 
02:40:18.830 --> 02:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
um in a in a capital plan so this year
 
02:40:21.830 --> 02:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
we'll be starting our update of the
 
02:40:25.130 --> 02:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
10-year plan process and when we do that
 
02:40:27.710 --> 02:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
folks we're going to get to talk about
 
02:40:31.190 --> 02:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
what our priorities are and when we can
 
02:40:34.790 --> 02:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
realistically expect to to build those
 
02:40:37.190 --> 02:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
projects but it's important for you for
 
02:40:39.650 --> 02:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
you all to understand that while we're
 
02:40:42.710 --> 02:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
getting by we we have things that we had
 
02:40:45.410 --> 02:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
planned to do sooner than we're going to
 
02:40:48.530 --> 02:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
to be able to do them with our current
 
02:40:51.590 --> 02:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:54.889 --> 02:40:54.899 align:start position:0%
and with that commissioner
 
02:40:56.030 --> 02:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
um are there any questions on the
 
02:40:57.950 --> 02:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
turnpike fund before we move to like the
 
02:41:00.610 --> 02:41:00.620 align:start position:0%
highway funded portion yeah I just would
 
02:41:03.170 --> 02:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks um the programs that you
 
02:41:03.180 --> 02:41:04.610 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks um the programs that you
listed

02:41:04.610 --> 02:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
listed
 
02:41:07.670 --> 02:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
um are they all part of the turnpike I
 
02:41:09.469 --> 02:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
don't know where Manchester exits six
 
02:41:10.790 --> 02:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
and seven is if that's part of the
 
02:41:12.710 --> 02:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
turnpike if you're not so these are all
 
02:41:14.270 --> 02:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
the all the four things you listed are
 
02:41:16.010 --> 02:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
all Turnpike thank you for Turnpike
 
02:41:17.690 --> 02:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
projects yep and I would point out
 
02:41:20.330 --> 02:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
representative Petrie in respect to your
 
02:41:23.510 --> 02:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
your prior question so on the federally
 
02:41:25.550 --> 02:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
funded side where
 
02:41:27.349 --> 02:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
um you know the additional federal funds
 
02:41:29.330 --> 02:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
and the inflation have kind of offset
 
02:41:32.990 --> 02:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
each other on the turnpike side uh
 
02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue has been flat so as you know
 
02:41:38.030 --> 02:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
costs increase
 
02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:39.170 align:start position:0%
costs increase
um

02:41:39.170 --> 02:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:42.170 --> 02:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
uh we're as as Dave said we're pushing
 
02:41:44.090 --> 02:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
thing we're pushing things out to take
 
02:41:47.270 --> 02:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
longer uh longer to get to at the same
 
02:41:49.790 --> 02:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
um funding levels so
 
02:41:51.050 --> 02:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
you said something about the general
 
02:41:53.330 --> 02:41:53.340 align:start position:0%
Sullivan Bridge what what's with that
 
02:41:55.550 --> 02:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
that's uh it's that scene it looked like
 
02:41:57.309 --> 02:41:57.319 align:start position:0%
it was complete except for the approach
 
02:42:00.050 --> 02:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
uh if you if you if you drive over it
 
02:42:03.050 --> 02:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
there's a there's an old the old rusted
 
02:42:05.150 --> 02:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
section of the bridge is being removed
 
02:42:07.070 --> 02:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
and replaced with a
 
02:42:11.030 --> 02:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:13.790 --> 02:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
once that estimated cost
 
02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:23.389 --> 02:42:23.399 align:start position:0%
so moving on to the highway fund
 
02:42:26.150 --> 02:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
overview for the Department
 
02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:27.290 align:start position:0%
overview for the Department
um

02:42:27.290 --> 02:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:31.309 --> 02:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
when we talk uh on on slide 16 is uh
 
02:42:32.330 --> 02:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
just some of the things that we had
 
02:42:33.710 --> 02:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
covered previously with the highway
 
02:42:35.750 --> 02:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
funding kind of a reminder the highway
 
02:42:38.210 --> 02:42:38.220 align:start position:0%
fund is not the dot and the dot is not
 
02:42:40.010 --> 02:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
the highway fund Revenue to the highway
 
02:42:41.750 --> 02:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
fund is generated from the gas tax
 
02:42:44.990 --> 02:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
primarily and registration fees was a
 
02:42:46.190 --> 02:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
connect those are collected by
 
02:42:48.050 --> 02:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety they do the revenue
 
02:42:51.050 --> 02:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
projections revenue from the highway
 
02:42:53.830 --> 02:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
fund is appropriated to various agencies
 
02:42:57.050 --> 02:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
dot safety judicial branch and Justice
 
02:43:01.010 --> 02:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
all received part of it the splits in FY
 
02:43:04.270 --> 02:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
22 are listed the iso in 2022
 
02:43:07.070 --> 02:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire dot received about 60
 
02:43:10.070 --> 02:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
percent of the highway fund uh Revenue
 
02:43:13.250 --> 02:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
that was appropriated from it uh 40 went
 
02:43:14.750 --> 02:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
to Department of Safety and other
 
02:43:18.770 --> 02:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
agencies as well as about uh 13 to 14
 
02:43:21.230 --> 02:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
percent of the highway fund Revenue that
 
02:43:24.410 --> 02:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
went to municipalities
 
02:43:24.420 --> 02:43:25.010 align:start position:0%
went to municipalities
um

02:43:25.010 --> 02:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:27.170 --> 02:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
and one of the points
 
02:43:29.870 --> 02:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
um the that I had made when when I
 
02:43:32.090 --> 02:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
talked about the breakup of our budget
 
02:43:34.070 --> 02:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
between the operating budget and the
 
02:43:35.929 --> 02:43:35.939 align:start position:0%
municipal and construction half of the
 
02:43:35.939 --> 02:43:37.190 align:start position:0%
municipal and construction half of the
budget

02:43:37.190 --> 02:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:43:40.010 --> 02:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
um the highway fund is the primary
 
02:43:41.870 --> 02:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
source of funding for our operating
 
02:43:44.929 --> 02:43:44.939 align:start position:0%
budget so which is you know very
 
02:43:46.070 --> 02:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
pertinent to what we're talking about
 
02:43:47.809 --> 02:43:47.819 align:start position:0%
here today the operating budget as
 
02:43:49.969 --> 02:43:49.979 align:start position:0%
opposed to some of the capital projects
 
02:43:53.150 --> 02:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
in the 10-year plan that David talked
 
02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:54.830 align:start position:0%
in the 10-year plan that David talked
about

02:43:54.830 --> 02:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:43:59.090 --> 02:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
so on slide 17 is a um a lot of numbers
 
02:44:01.070 --> 02:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
so I apologize for this I know the
 
02:44:02.990 --> 02:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
committee in the past has asked for this
 
02:44:06.469 --> 02:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh slide has asked for this information
 
02:44:09.170 --> 02:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
um and I I just like to just step you
 
02:44:10.730 --> 02:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
through it because it is somewhat
 
02:44:14.450 --> 02:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
pertinent in how the highway fund works
 
02:44:16.790 --> 02:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
and how the gas tax is distributed to
 
02:44:18.650 --> 02:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
some of the elements in our budget as
 
02:44:22.550 --> 02:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
well as some of the other agencies
 
02:44:25.790 --> 02:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
so the highway so the gas tax the road
 
02:44:28.389 --> 02:44:28.399 align:start position:0%
toll if you will is uh
 
02:44:30.770 --> 02:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
22.2 cents
 
02:44:30.780 --> 02:44:31.550 align:start position:0%
22.2 cents
um

02:44:31.550 --> 02:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:33.130 --> 02:44:33.140 align:start position:0%
per gallon
 
02:44:36.590 --> 02:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
and an FY 22 that represented a a
 
02:44:39.710 --> 02:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
certain level of Revenue so by Statute
 
02:44:43.849 --> 02:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
12 percent of the gas tax goes to cities
 
02:44:46.250 --> 02:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
and towns through block grant Aid which
 
02:44:48.349 --> 02:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
is administered through Department of
 
02:44:50.990 --> 02:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation so in our budget we have
 
02:44:53.389 --> 02:44:53.399 align:start position:0%
a um we have a
 
02:44:56.389 --> 02:44:56.399 align:start position:0%
an au we have an organizational unit for
 
02:44:58.190 --> 02:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
that block grant Aid and that funding
 
02:45:00.490 --> 02:45:00.500 align:start position:0%
that goes to cities and towns
 
02:45:04.210 --> 02:45:04.220 align:start position:0%
statutorily 2.6 cents or about 3 percent
 
02:45:07.309 --> 02:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
of the gas tax is
 
02:45:07.319 --> 02:45:07.849 align:start position:0%
of the gas tax is
um

02:45:07.849 --> 02:45:07.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:11.270 --> 02:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
about three cents minus the two 12 minus
 
02:45:11.280 --> 02:45:12.170 align:start position:0%
about three cents minus the two 12 minus
the

02:45:12.170 --> 02:45:12.180 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:45:15.230 --> 02:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
um 12 percent to cities and talents so
 
02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
about 2.6 cents of the gas tax goes to a
 
02:45:21.170 --> 02:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
restricted account uh called the
 
02:45:23.870 --> 02:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
betterment account which is uh also an
 
02:45:25.790 --> 02:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
org in our budget
 
02:45:27.950 --> 02:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
um which goes towards
 
02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:28.670 align:start position:0%
um which goes towards
um

02:45:28.670 --> 02:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:31.849 --> 02:45:31.859 align:start position:0%
uh kind of state roads heavy heavy road
 
02:45:34.130 --> 02:45:34.140 align:start position:0%
maintenance the betterment program is
 
02:45:36.290 --> 02:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
the primary source of our routine
 
02:45:38.750 --> 02:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance Paving Ever every year so it
 
02:45:41.150 --> 02:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
goes to City so it goes to
 
02:45:43.610 --> 02:45:43.620 align:start position:0%
um it's restricted to go towards
 
02:45:46.070 --> 02:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
um State highways and bridges
 
02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:47.630 align:start position:0%
um State highways and bridges
um

02:45:47.630 --> 02:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:51.950 --> 02:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
and then out of the 22.6 and and 2014
 
02:45:57.170 --> 02:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
there was a um a bill passed SB 367 that
 
02:45:59.330 --> 02:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
restricted uh
 
02:46:02.690 --> 02:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
3.7 cents of that to a restricted
 
02:46:05.450 --> 02:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
account that it goes to pay the um
 
02:46:08.090 --> 02:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
ultimately goes to pay the debt service
 
02:46:10.910 --> 02:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
on the um
 
02:46:14.270 --> 02:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
on the tipia loan that we took out to
 
02:46:16.849 --> 02:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
fund the I-93 construction project so
 
02:46:19.130 --> 02:46:19.140 align:start position:0%
while the I-93 construction project is
 
02:46:19.140 --> 02:46:20.030 align:start position:0%
while the I-93 construction project is
done

02:46:20.030 --> 02:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:46:23.090 --> 02:46:23.100 align:start position:0%
part of the gas tax that went into a
 
02:46:26.750 --> 02:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
place to support that work we are still
 
02:46:28.730 --> 02:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
paying for that and we will be paying
 
02:46:31.370 --> 02:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
for that for some for some for some time
 
02:46:33.110 --> 02:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
and I have a little bit more information
 
02:46:35.630 --> 02:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
on the next slide of that
 
02:46:37.849 --> 02:46:37.859 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of the waterfall on on
 
02:46:40.429 --> 02:46:40.439 align:start position:0%
that side motor vehicle fees are also a
 
02:46:43.309 --> 02:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
substantial portion of the highway fund
 
02:46:46.130 --> 02:46:46.140 align:start position:0%
um again 12 percent of the motor vehicle
 
02:46:49.670 --> 02:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
fees go to that block grant Aid cities
 
02:46:51.830 --> 02:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
and towns and you can see there the net
 
02:46:54.770 --> 02:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle fees
 
02:46:56.389 --> 02:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
um and motor vehicle fines also go
 
02:46:59.210 --> 02:46:59.220 align:start position:0%
toward the highway fund so
 
02:47:01.429 --> 02:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to kind of walk walk you
 
02:47:03.110 --> 02:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
through how the road toll and motor
 
02:47:05.809 --> 02:47:05.819 align:start position:0%
vehicle fees and fines work the very
 
02:47:09.410 --> 02:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
last four columns do summarize the uh
 
02:47:11.450 --> 02:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
split of funding for
 
02:47:13.730 --> 02:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
um how much percentage-wise goes to the
 
02:47:15.530 --> 02:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
municipalities how much goes to other
 
02:47:17.389 --> 02:47:17.399 align:start position:0%
agencies and how much goes to the
 
02:47:19.790 --> 02:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation and there
 
02:47:22.429 --> 02:47:22.439 align:start position:0%
are some rsas that that govern a certain
 
02:47:25.670 --> 02:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
minimal portion of the highway fund that
 
02:47:27.070 --> 02:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
goes to
 
02:47:29.510 --> 02:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
other agencies and the Department of
 
02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:32.389 align:start position:0%
other agencies and the Department of
Transportation

02:47:32.389 --> 02:47:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:34.190 --> 02:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
so hopefully that's not
 
02:47:36.290 --> 02:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
too much information but that's I I
 
02:47:37.790 --> 02:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to just point that out because I
 
02:47:39.349 --> 02:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
said that it's been asked for in the
 
02:47:41.990 --> 02:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
past but it does correlate to several
 
02:47:44.090 --> 02:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
areas of funding within our within our
 
02:47:47.389 --> 02:47:47.399 align:start position:0%
budget that again are driven by
 
02:47:49.070 --> 02:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
um by the revenue stream that's
 
02:47:51.170 --> 02:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
collected by the motor vehicle fees and
 
02:47:54.770 --> 02:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
and and the um and the road toll
 
02:47:59.270 --> 02:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
I had mentioned in passing the SB 367 uh
 
02:48:02.630 --> 02:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh tiffia Debt Service so
 
02:48:05.330 --> 02:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
um there was established in statute of
 
02:48:07.550 --> 02:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
waterfall that that came with that so
 
02:48:07.560 --> 02:48:08.590 align:start position:0%
waterfall that that came with that so
essentially

02:48:08.590 --> 02:48:08.600 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
02:48:12.170 --> 02:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
4.2 cents of the gas tax is dedicate of
 
02:48:15.349 --> 02:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
that road toll was dedicated toward uh
 
02:48:17.929 --> 02:48:17.939 align:start position:0%
this tipia Debt Service
 
02:48:21.650 --> 02:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
um again 12 of of that goes first to
 
02:48:24.050 --> 02:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
Municipal block grant Aid
 
02:48:24.060 --> 02:48:24.950 align:start position:0%
Municipal block grant Aid
um

02:48:24.950 --> 02:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:27.230 --> 02:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
then it goes to the debt service for the
 
02:48:29.150 --> 02:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
tipia financing
 
02:48:32.870 --> 02:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
we did a um when we when we financed
 
02:48:35.570 --> 02:48:35.580 align:start position:0%
I-93 we were able to defer interest
 
02:48:37.429 --> 02:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
payments for
 
02:48:37.439 --> 02:48:38.150 align:start position:0%
payments for
um

02:48:38.150 --> 02:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:41.330 --> 02:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
uh 10 for five years after the project
 
02:48:43.070 --> 02:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
was completed so the project was
 
02:48:46.490 --> 02:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
completed in 2020 so we were able to
 
02:48:49.429 --> 02:48:49.439 align:start position:0%
defer both during the construction and
 
02:48:51.230 --> 02:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
for five years after the completion of
 
02:48:53.870 --> 02:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
construction the full principal Debt
 
02:48:56.389 --> 02:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
Service on that loan and I wanted to put
 
02:48:57.770 --> 02:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
breaking this up
 
02:49:00.770 --> 02:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
um in in this slide because
 
02:49:03.290 --> 02:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
but the duration of while 93 was being
 
02:49:05.389 --> 02:49:05.399 align:start position:0%
constructed and until the full principal
 
02:49:07.190 --> 02:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
Debt Service kicks in there was a
 
02:49:10.070 --> 02:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
waterfall where the additional funding
 
02:49:13.910 --> 02:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
from that 4.2 cents went to
 
02:49:13.920 --> 02:49:15.710 align:start position:0%
from that 4.2 cents went to
um

02:49:15.710 --> 02:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:18.050 --> 02:49:18.060 align:start position:0%
state aid Bridge funding and it also
 
02:49:21.349 --> 02:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
went to uh Paving rural roads and
 
02:49:25.670 --> 02:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
addressing rural bridges in 2025 The
 
02:49:27.770 --> 02:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
Debt Service full Debt Service and
 
02:49:30.290 --> 02:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
payment of the principal does does kick
 
02:49:32.809 --> 02:49:32.819 align:start position:0%
in and then and after that
 
02:49:32.819 --> 02:49:33.410 align:start position:0%
in and then and after that
um

02:49:33.410 --> 02:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:36.130 --> 02:49:36.140 align:start position:0%
uh funding for state aid Municipal
 
02:49:39.710 --> 02:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
Municipal Bridges will begin to decline
 
02:49:42.830 --> 02:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
as revenue is projected to decline in
 
02:49:46.070 --> 02:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
the in the highway fund as a result of
 
02:49:48.170 --> 02:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
the gas tax
 
02:49:51.889 --> 02:49:51.899 align:start position:0%
um and also the 20 million dollars or so
 
02:49:54.290 --> 02:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
um 20 21 million dollars or so that we
 
02:49:57.170 --> 02:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
have been able to put towards
 
02:49:59.570 --> 02:49:59.580 align:start position:0%
um rural roads and bridges will now go
 
02:50:01.670 --> 02:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
to Debt Service so that will leave a
 
02:50:01.680 --> 02:50:02.809 align:start position:0%
to Debt Service so that will leave a
hole

02:50:02.809 --> 02:50:02.819 align:start position:0%
hole
 
02:50:05.030 --> 02:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
um in the in the program that has done a
 
02:50:09.410 --> 02:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:13.550 --> 02:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
um so it's less of a uh uh an issue I
 
02:50:15.410 --> 02:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
think with this biennial budget but at
 
02:50:16.730 --> 02:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
the end of this biennium and certainly
 
02:50:18.230 --> 02:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
when we get to the next budgets it's
 
02:50:19.490 --> 02:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
something to
 
02:50:20.870 --> 02:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
um as one to bring to your attention
 
02:50:22.910 --> 02:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
because there will be something
 
02:50:24.070 --> 02:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
um that we'll have to reckon with
 
02:50:26.450 --> 02:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
representative right thank you for
 
02:50:28.730 --> 02:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I see a few
 
02:50:31.670 --> 02:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
suspended a gas tax by many people think
 
02:50:34.610 --> 02:50:34.620 align:start position:0%
that the gas prices are too high and
 
02:50:36.889 --> 02:50:36.899 align:start position:0%
that would cause a what 174 million
 
02:50:38.870 --> 02:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
dollar hole
 
02:50:40.730 --> 02:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
depending on you know that's for the
 
02:50:43.790 --> 02:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
whole year but uh yeah that would be
 
02:50:46.370 --> 02:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
quite a quite a burden on on your uh
 
02:50:48.170 --> 02:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
spend it for a whole year I sure would
 
02:50:50.510 --> 02:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
yes or or even part of it I mean you
 
02:50:52.490 --> 02:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
know one I mean it's one twelfth right
 
02:50:54.050 --> 02:50:54.060 align:start position:0%
probably for a month or several months
 
02:50:57.050 --> 02:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
yep so I mean but that's
 
02:50:59.990 --> 02:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
what would what would happen
 
02:51:02.090 --> 02:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
as far as the budget is concerned I mean
 
02:51:04.309 --> 02:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
it would would you have to just stop
 
02:51:06.530 --> 02:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
some of your bridge building or what I
 
02:51:06.540 --> 02:51:07.370 align:start position:0%
some of your bridge building or what I
mean

02:51:07.370 --> 02:51:07.380 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:51:09.349 --> 02:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
you sure I mean you got to plow the
 
02:51:10.730 --> 02:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
roads I mean you gotta you've got to
 
02:51:12.170 --> 02:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
maintain a rule well that's yeah that
 
02:51:13.490 --> 02:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
would be an interesting question most of
 
02:51:14.870 --> 02:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
our bridge building and stuff is done
 
02:51:16.490 --> 02:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
with federal funds so it wouldn't
 
02:51:18.830 --> 02:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily have as much of an impact on
 
02:51:21.170 --> 02:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
our construction program certainly the
 
02:51:22.610 --> 02:51:22.620 align:start position:0%
uh Personnel that oversee the
 
02:51:24.830 --> 02:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
construction program but it could have
 
02:51:28.370 --> 02:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh a very real effect on our
 
02:51:30.530 --> 02:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
ability to plow roads and things like
 
02:51:32.330 --> 02:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
that as the um
 
02:51:34.849 --> 02:51:34.859 align:start position:0%
as like like I said the bulk of our
 
02:51:36.710 --> 02:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
operating budget is funded by the
 
02:51:40.130 --> 02:51:40.140 align:start position:0%
highway fund and not the federal funds
 
02:51:43.130 --> 02:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
the federal funds can you do other other
 
02:51:45.590 --> 02:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
than Federal highways
 
02:51:48.170 --> 02:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
no no so that's that's another so you
 
02:51:49.910 --> 02:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
restricted in that in that sense right
 
02:51:52.010 --> 02:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
and and getting back to the
 
02:51:55.610 --> 02:51:55.620 align:start position:0%
the getting back to the SB 367 and the
 
02:51:59.510 --> 02:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
4.2 Cent gas tax I mean this was that
 
02:52:02.330 --> 02:52:02.340 align:start position:0%
money was pledged particularly for Rural
 
02:52:04.790 --> 02:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
roads and bridges which are about
 
02:52:06.830 --> 02:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
one-third of the mileage of State
 
02:52:09.950 --> 02:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
highways that we maintain are not
 
02:52:12.469 --> 02:52:12.479 align:start position:0%
eligible for federal funds
 
02:52:15.650 --> 02:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
um so we rely on you know State funds
 
02:52:17.090 --> 02:52:17.100 align:start position:0%
whether it be the betterment program
 
02:52:19.550 --> 02:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
that I touched on or these funds to
 
02:52:24.370 --> 02:52:24.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:26.690 --> 02:52:26.700 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you commissioner for
 
02:52:28.190 --> 02:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
coming today
 
02:52:28.200 --> 02:52:29.210 align:start position:0%
coming today
um

02:52:29.210 --> 02:52:29.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:32.150 --> 02:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
so when when the Tiffy of waterfall
 
02:52:32.160 --> 02:52:33.950 align:start position:0%
so when when the Tiffy of waterfall
stops

02:52:33.950 --> 02:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
stops
 
02:52:36.170 --> 02:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
that's that's going to cut back on the
 
02:52:39.050 --> 02:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
paving program but is that does this
 
02:52:41.510 --> 02:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
does the force sense also sunset at the
 
02:52:42.650 --> 02:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
same time
 
02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
the port said sunsets when The Debt
 
02:52:48.349 --> 02:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
Service is paid off in 2035.
 
02:52:51.410 --> 02:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
so it will continue on that won't okay I
 
02:52:52.849 --> 02:52:52.859 align:start position:0%
thought it was going to be with two
 
02:52:55.309 --> 02:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
holes no no
 
02:52:58.730 --> 02:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:00.830 --> 02:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
so I'll I'll keep going if there are
 
02:53:03.110 --> 02:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
more questions the next two slides
 
02:53:03.120 --> 02:53:04.130 align:start position:0%
more questions the next two slides
um

02:53:04.130 --> 02:53:04.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:05.929 --> 02:53:05.939 align:start position:0%
and and just a few things about the
 
02:53:07.429 --> 02:53:07.439 align:start position:0%
highway fund that I'd want to point out
 
02:53:09.410 --> 02:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
and I'll be uh
 
02:53:09.420 --> 02:53:11.210 align:start position:0%
and I'll be uh
um

02:53:11.210 --> 02:53:11.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:13.849 --> 02:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
try to be respectful of everybody's time
 
02:53:17.750 --> 02:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
slide 19 is a is kind of a graph of of
 
02:53:19.730 --> 02:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
the total unrestricted Revenue in the
 
02:53:23.330 --> 02:53:23.340 align:start position:0%
highway fund over over time so you can
 
02:53:26.450 --> 02:53:26.460 align:start position:0%
see back in the you know the
 
02:53:29.450 --> 02:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
previous five years of the prior decade
 
02:53:31.670 --> 02:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
a declining
 
02:53:31.680 --> 02:53:32.809 align:start position:0%
a declining
um

02:53:32.809 --> 02:53:32.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:34.849 --> 02:53:34.859 align:start position:0%
rate of
 
02:53:37.750 --> 02:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue into the highway fund and since
 
02:53:41.870 --> 02:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
2016 it has grown a little bit but the
 
02:53:45.730 --> 02:53:45.740 align:start position:0%
outcome from this this chart is to
 
02:53:49.070 --> 02:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
emphasize that the that the revenue into
 
02:53:52.730 --> 02:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
the highway fund is is is very flat it's
 
02:53:55.010 --> 02:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
projected to stay flat
 
02:53:58.190 --> 02:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
um and potentially in the future with
 
02:54:01.429 --> 02:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
EVs and other other increased gas
 
02:54:06.230 --> 02:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
mileage decline incrementally so as we
 
02:54:08.030 --> 02:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
talk about you know
 
02:54:10.130 --> 02:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
um you know continued inflationary costs
 
02:54:11.990 --> 02:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
and things like that
 
02:54:14.389 --> 02:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
um budgetarily you know this level of
 
02:54:18.170 --> 02:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
funding is is something to look at and
 
02:54:18.180 --> 02:54:19.130 align:start position:0%
funding is is something to look at and
address

02:54:19.130 --> 02:54:19.140 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:54:23.870 --> 02:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
on the next slide slide 20 it represents
 
02:54:25.849 --> 02:54:25.859 align:start position:0%
um in in the in the top bar with some of
 
02:54:27.530 --> 02:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
the details
 
02:54:29.510 --> 02:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
this is just meant to show that there
 
02:54:32.090 --> 02:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
have been a number of
 
02:54:32.100 --> 02:54:32.889 align:start position:0%
have been a number of
um

02:54:32.889 --> 02:54:32.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:36.469 --> 02:54:36.479 align:start position:0%
you know one time fixes one time sources
 
02:54:39.830 --> 02:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
one time uh infusions of funding into
 
02:54:43.190 --> 02:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
the uh Highway fund that have allowed us
 
02:54:45.590 --> 02:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
to help balance the budget over the
 
02:54:48.050 --> 02:54:48.060 align:start position:0%
years so there have been things like a
 
02:54:51.130 --> 02:54:51.140 align:start position:0%
thirty dollar registrations uh
 
02:54:54.889 --> 02:54:54.899 align:start position:0%
surcharge in 2010 and 11.
 
02:54:54.899 --> 02:54:55.790 align:start position:0%
surcharge in 2010 and 11.
um

02:54:55.790 --> 02:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:00.110 --> 02:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
some things where we sold a a bridge the
 
02:55:02.150 --> 02:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
I-95 Bridge we sold it to the turnpike
 
02:55:03.950 --> 02:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
system so the turnpike system paid the
 
02:55:07.250 --> 02:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
highway fund uh over a number of years
 
02:55:11.210 --> 02:55:11.220 align:start position:0%
uh for that asset which was a way of
 
02:55:13.849 --> 02:55:13.859 align:start position:0%
helping bail out the highway fund
 
02:55:13.859 --> 02:55:14.630 align:start position:0%
helping bail out the highway fund
um

02:55:14.630 --> 02:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:17.450 --> 02:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
most recently there have been several
 
02:55:17.460 --> 02:55:19.070 align:start position:0%
most recently there have been several
um

02:55:19.070 --> 02:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:19.080 --> 02:55:20.330 align:start position:0%
um
um

02:55:20.330 --> 02:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:23.150 --> 02:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
uh transfers general fund transfers into
 
02:55:25.730 --> 02:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
the highway fund most notably at the end
 
02:55:30.230 --> 02:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
of FY uh 22 I know in the Senate was
 
02:55:32.990 --> 02:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
looking ahead and looking at the status
 
02:55:35.990 --> 02:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
of the highway fund they put 50 million
 
02:55:37.429 --> 02:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
dollars of
 
02:55:37.439 --> 02:55:38.389 align:start position:0%
dollars of
um

02:55:38.389 --> 02:55:38.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:41.150 --> 02:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
a general fund Surplus into the highway
 
02:55:43.670 --> 02:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
fund to sustain it for the next biennium
 
02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:45.349 align:start position:0%
fund to sustain it for the next biennium
so

02:55:45.349 --> 02:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:55:47.510 --> 02:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
um that's not terribly different than
 
02:55:49.250 --> 02:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
what Washington is doing with the
 
02:55:51.110 --> 02:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway fund as well with with
 
02:55:54.710 --> 02:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
routine infusions of General funds to
 
02:55:57.290 --> 02:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
keep the highway fund afloat
 
02:55:58.790 --> 02:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
but that's the scope in order of
 
02:56:01.070 --> 02:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
magnitude of of what has been done over
 
02:56:04.010 --> 02:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
the years to sustain the highway fund
 
02:56:06.349 --> 02:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
and if you look at page 21 the next
 
02:56:08.929 --> 02:56:08.939 align:start position:0%
slide that is
 
02:56:11.510 --> 02:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
um that is the status of the highway
 
02:56:14.349 --> 02:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
fund that is the Surplus fund statement
 
02:56:17.570 --> 02:56:17.580 align:start position:0%
through the upcoming biennium and a
 
02:56:21.410 --> 02:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
couple of points that I want to make uh
 
02:56:23.150 --> 02:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
um on on this
 
02:56:23.160 --> 02:56:23.929 align:start position:0%
um on on this
um

02:56:23.929 --> 02:56:23.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:25.969 --> 02:56:25.979 align:start position:0%
you know it does show at the very end of
 
02:56:29.750 --> 02:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
the biennium and fy25 a um a positive
 
02:56:31.849 --> 02:56:31.859 align:start position:0%
balance in the highway fund so that is
 
02:56:34.309 --> 02:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
being used I I pointed out the the
 
02:56:38.090 --> 02:56:38.100 align:start position:0%
infusion of 50 million dollars in FY 22
 
02:56:39.710 --> 02:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
into the highway fund that's helping
 
02:56:42.110 --> 02:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
sustain us through this biennium
 
02:56:44.690 --> 02:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
um there are a few notes again with that
 
02:56:47.150 --> 02:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
level Revenue that I talked about that
 
02:56:49.969 --> 02:56:49.979 align:start position:0%
uh give us a little bit of a pause as as
 
02:56:52.370 --> 02:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
we look at the you know long-term
 
02:56:56.030 --> 02:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
budgetary stability here
 
02:56:56.040 --> 02:56:56.630 align:start position:0%
budgetary stability here
um

02:56:56.630 --> 02:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:59.510 --> 02:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things
 
02:57:01.790 --> 02:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
that we had pointed out in our Edition
 
02:57:05.450 --> 02:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
and our additional needs uh was was some
 
02:57:07.429 --> 02:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
of the inflationary impacts of the major
 
02:57:09.050 --> 02:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
elements that that we use for
 
02:57:11.630 --> 02:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
particularly winter maintenance
 
02:57:14.570 --> 02:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
um uh salt and fuel of the two biggest
 
02:57:17.090 --> 02:57:17.100 align:start position:0%
drivers and
 
02:57:18.830 --> 02:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
um those have
 
02:57:20.809 --> 02:57:20.819 align:start position:0%
um those have gone up and and we were
 
02:57:24.349 --> 02:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
projecting them to to go up again to
 
02:57:26.230 --> 02:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
meet our budget targets we had level
 
02:57:29.750 --> 02:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
budget targets to meet we had identified
 
02:57:32.570 --> 02:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
those inflationary cost drivers and the
 
02:57:34.670 --> 02:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
additional needs and those additional
 
02:57:36.830 --> 02:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
needs were not included in in the in the
 
02:57:41.510 --> 02:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
budget the rationale of that was
 
02:57:42.769 --> 02:57:42.779 align:start position:0%
um you know some of the inflationary
 
02:57:45.410 --> 02:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
needs are are fairly speculative it's
 
02:57:48.050 --> 02:57:48.060 align:start position:0%
hard to pinpoint how much gas is going
 
02:57:50.690 --> 02:57:50.700 align:start position:0%
to cost next year or in two years same
 
02:57:53.750 --> 02:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
thing with with road salt and diesel
 
02:57:55.370 --> 02:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
fuel and things like that so the
 
02:57:55.380 --> 02:57:56.750 align:start position:0%
fuel and things like that so the
decision

02:57:56.750 --> 02:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:57:58.730 --> 02:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
um as part of this budget was was was
 
02:58:01.849 --> 02:58:01.859 align:start position:0%
made to keep it level funded and if
 
02:58:04.070 --> 02:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
those inflationary costs manifest
 
02:58:06.710 --> 02:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
themselves in the future we could go
 
02:58:09.769 --> 02:58:09.779 align:start position:0%
back to fiscal for um for a transfer to
 
02:58:11.389 --> 02:58:11.399 align:start position:0%
address that
 
02:58:11.399 --> 02:58:12.910 align:start position:0%
address that
um

02:58:12.910 --> 02:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:15.889 --> 02:58:15.899 align:start position:0%
historically we have not
 
02:58:15.899 --> 02:58:16.790 align:start position:0%
historically we have not
um

02:58:16.790 --> 02:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:19.070 --> 02:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
fully budgeted winter maintenance as
 
02:58:22.730 --> 02:58:22.740 align:start position:0%
well we've always we we the department
 
02:58:27.050 --> 02:58:27.060 align:start position:0%
typically try to budget for a three-year
 
02:58:29.750 --> 02:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
average of winter maintenance costs
 
02:58:29.760 --> 02:58:30.769 align:start position:0%
average of winter maintenance costs
um

02:58:30.769 --> 02:58:30.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:33.769 --> 02:58:33.779 align:start position:0%
uh historically we have underfunded
 
02:58:37.250 --> 02:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance and uh every year for
 
02:58:40.190 --> 02:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
the last uh for the last five or six
 
02:58:41.510 --> 02:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
years that I've been around and remember
 
02:58:43.790 --> 02:58:43.800 align:start position:0%
we have gone back to
 
02:58:43.800 --> 02:58:45.170 align:start position:0%
we have gone back to
um

02:58:45.170 --> 02:58:45.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:47.330 --> 02:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
um we have gone back to fiscal committee
 
02:58:49.730 --> 02:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
during the winter to
 
02:58:51.590 --> 02:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
um you know seek additional funds of
 
02:58:53.510 --> 02:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
transfer from the highway fund Surplus
 
02:58:55.309 --> 02:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
to carry us through the winter we just
 
02:58:56.750 --> 02:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
went last
 
02:58:58.550 --> 02:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
was it last Friday or the Friday before
 
02:59:03.050 --> 02:59:03.060 align:start position:0%
last Friday it's a fiscal for a 3.4
 
02:59:06.769 --> 02:59:06.779 align:start position:0%
million dollar Surplus transfer to carry
 
02:59:09.950 --> 02:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
us through through this winter so
 
02:59:13.849 --> 02:59:13.859 align:start position:0%
um with those inflationary costs uh with
 
02:59:13.859 --> 02:59:14.870 align:start position:0%
um with those inflationary costs uh with
those

02:59:14.870 --> 02:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:59:14.880 --> 02:59:15.650 align:start position:0%
those
um

02:59:15.650 --> 02:59:15.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:18.349 --> 02:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
trend of historically under under
 
02:59:21.230 --> 02:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
budgeting winter maintenance if those if
 
02:59:23.210 --> 02:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
those costs manifest themselves over the
 
02:59:26.090 --> 02:59:26.100 align:start position:0%
next two years and we are going back to
 
02:59:29.769 --> 02:59:29.779 align:start position:0%
seek transfers this
 
02:59:32.929 --> 02:59:32.939 align:start position:0%
13.1 million dollar balance at the end
 
02:59:34.070 --> 02:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:59:36.610 --> 02:59:36.620 align:start position:0%
um at the end of the biennium may not be
 
02:59:39.530 --> 02:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
enough to carry us through
 
02:59:39.540 --> 02:59:40.490 align:start position:0%
enough to carry us through
um

02:59:40.490 --> 02:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:43.849 --> 02:59:43.859 align:start position:0%
again revenues uh assumed to be flat
 
02:59:45.590 --> 02:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
those may or may not come in a little
 
02:59:48.650 --> 02:59:48.660 align:start position:0%
bit more but um
 
02:59:50.450 --> 02:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to point that out on the
 
02:59:51.889 --> 02:59:51.899 align:start position:0%
circle statement that those are some of
 
02:59:54.530 --> 02:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
the concerns that that we sit see and
 
02:59:56.570 --> 02:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
wanted to articulate
 
02:59:58.790 --> 02:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
um the other concern we see in in this
 
03:00:03.349 --> 03:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
is uh is in the lapse assumption uh
 
03:00:05.990 --> 03:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
lapse is a typically budgeted on a look
 
03:00:08.269 --> 03:00:08.279 align:start position:0%
back and and and trying to average it
 
03:00:11.809 --> 03:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
out over the last uh few years I'm not
 
03:00:14.450 --> 03:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
sure if it's three or five but
 
03:00:17.090 --> 03:00:17.100 align:start position:0%
um over the over the pandemic period of
 
03:00:22.130 --> 03:00:22.140 align:start position:0%
uh 20 21 20 2020 2021
 
03:00:22.140 --> 03:00:22.790 align:start position:0%
uh 20 21 20 2020 2021
um

03:00:22.790 --> 03:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:26.269 --> 03:00:26.279 align:start position:0%
we had significant lapses both because
 
03:00:28.969 --> 03:00:28.979 align:start position:0%
of hiring freezes and both
 
03:00:30.590 --> 03:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
um because of other
 
03:00:30.600 --> 03:00:31.250 align:start position:0%
um because of other
um

03:00:31.250 --> 03:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:34.190 --> 03:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
decisions not to expend money because of
 
03:00:36.530 --> 03:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
the concern of the status of the highway
 
03:00:39.830 --> 03:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
fund and things like that so I think the
 
03:00:42.370 --> 03:00:42.380 align:start position:0%
lapses that we had shown in those years
 
03:00:45.830 --> 03:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
were inordinately high and I think
 
03:00:48.469 --> 03:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
that's reflected in in what's assumed
 
03:00:51.290 --> 03:00:51.300 align:start position:0%
for 24 and 25
 
03:00:54.110 --> 03:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
um but but again those those High lapses
 
03:00:57.110 --> 03:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
are concerning to us we do have a high
 
03:00:59.690 --> 03:00:59.700 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate that we're trying to knock
 
03:00:59.700 --> 03:01:01.070 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate that we're trying to knock
down

03:01:01.070 --> 03:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
down
 
03:01:02.690 --> 03:01:02.700 align:start position:0%
um you heard the governor's budget
 
03:01:04.309 --> 03:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
presentation it does include a 10
 
03:01:05.990 --> 03:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
percent increase for state employees
 
03:01:08.450 --> 03:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
hopefully that'll stem the tide and and
 
03:01:11.570 --> 03:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
when we can rebuild some of that
 
03:01:13.730 --> 03:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
um but with the with this estimated
 
03:01:16.910 --> 03:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
lapse it could be a challenge for us to
 
03:01:20.330 --> 03:01:20.340 align:start position:0%
meet it and we would not uh it would be
 
03:01:21.830 --> 03:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to be in a position of
 
03:01:27.290 --> 03:01:27.300 align:start position:0%
having to not hire people and not um
 
03:01:29.630 --> 03:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
um and artificially limit the work in
 
03:01:32.269 --> 03:01:32.279 align:start position:0%
order to meet the lapse
 
03:01:32.279 --> 03:01:34.309 align:start position:0%
order to meet the lapse
um

03:01:34.309 --> 03:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:36.889 --> 03:01:36.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I'm looking at
 
03:01:40.130 --> 03:01:40.140 align:start position:0%
this are you are the lapses you're
 
03:01:43.389 --> 03:01:43.399 align:start position:0%
considering for 24 and 25
 
03:01:47.150 --> 03:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
27 million and 28 million yes sir yes
 
03:01:50.630 --> 03:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:54.650 --> 03:01:54.660 align:start position:0%
so quick numbers yeah they're quite High
 
03:01:56.870 --> 03:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
compared to you know what we have in uh
 
03:01:58.550 --> 03:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know budgeted and adjusted
 
03:02:02.210 --> 03:02:02.220 align:start position:0%
authorized of fy23 for example so
 
03:02:02.220 --> 03:02:04.910 align:start position:0%
authorized of fy23 for example so
um

03:02:04.910 --> 03:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:07.849 --> 03:02:07.859 align:start position:0%
so it is it it is a an issue that we
 
03:02:10.309 --> 03:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
want to talk about the the other last
 
03:02:12.110 --> 03:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
point on the
 
03:02:12.120 --> 03:02:13.070 align:start position:0%
point on the
um

03:02:13.070 --> 03:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:15.290 --> 03:02:15.300 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement here that I like to
 
03:02:17.510 --> 03:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
make and and it's and it's and it's kind
 
03:02:19.429 --> 03:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
of endemic of the structural deficit
 
03:02:21.230 --> 03:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
within the highway fund if you look at
 
03:02:23.269 --> 03:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
the annual year
 
03:02:25.190 --> 03:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
um the current year activity which is
 
03:02:27.290 --> 03:02:27.300 align:start position:0%
the line right below the total
 
03:02:27.300 --> 03:02:28.730 align:start position:0%
the line right below the total
deductions

03:02:28.730 --> 03:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
deductions
 
03:02:32.389 --> 03:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
you'll see particularly in 24 and 25 and
 
03:02:36.710 --> 03:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
and even this year we are
 
03:02:38.450 --> 03:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's called deficit
 
03:02:40.070 --> 03:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
spending but certainly the
 
03:02:43.490 --> 03:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
Appropriations exceed
 
03:02:43.500 --> 03:02:44.570 align:start position:0%
Appropriations exceed
um

03:02:44.570 --> 03:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:48.110 --> 03:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
the revenue by you know 30 million
 
03:02:50.870 --> 03:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
37 million 44 million dollars so that
 
03:02:52.550 --> 03:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
structural deficit is eating away at the
 
03:02:54.650 --> 03:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
03:02:56.990 --> 03:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
um it's a big reason and that look ahead
 
03:02:59.750 --> 03:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
why the Senate did Park put 50 million
 
03:03:02.210 --> 03:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
dollars of general fund Surplus to carry
 
03:03:04.130 --> 03:03:04.140 align:start position:0%
us through the biennium
 
03:03:04.140 --> 03:03:05.389 align:start position:0%
us through the biennium
um

03:03:05.389 --> 03:03:05.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:07.550 --> 03:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:03:10.130 --> 03:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
I think it does serve to illustrate the
 
03:03:11.990 --> 03:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
precariousness of the highway fund so
 
03:03:13.490 --> 03:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that but those are some
 
03:03:18.469 --> 03:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:20.690 --> 03:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
we can take questions later you look
 
03:03:21.650 --> 03:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
like you were going to ask a question
 
03:03:24.490 --> 03:03:24.500 align:start position:0%
representative Buco but I didn't want to
 
03:03:29.570 --> 03:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:29.580 --> 03:03:30.769 align:start position:0%
 
my

03:03:30.769 --> 03:03:30.779 align:start position:0%
my
 
03:03:35.170 --> 03:03:35.180 align:start position:0%
my question was actually about about um
 
03:03:38.750 --> 03:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
mechanical services and equipment and I
 
03:03:39.950 --> 03:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
didn't know if you didn't get to that
 
03:03:41.929 --> 03:03:41.939 align:start position:0%
I'm going to get to that next yep so
 
03:03:43.610 --> 03:03:43.620 align:start position:0%
that was a high level overview of the
 
03:03:47.269 --> 03:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
highway fund on slide 22
 
03:03:48.769 --> 03:03:48.779 align:start position:0%
um some of the additional needs in our
 
03:03:50.870 --> 03:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
budget that were funded
 
03:03:52.730 --> 03:03:52.740 align:start position:0%
um you know we're we're the increase in
 
03:03:55.190 --> 03:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
debt service payments uh the block grant
 
03:03:57.530 --> 03:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
increases to um which are tied to the
 
03:03:57.540 --> 03:03:58.490 align:start position:0%
increases to um which are tied to the
revenue

03:03:58.490 --> 03:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
03:04:01.490 --> 03:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
um increases at least compared Revenue
 
03:04:04.910 --> 03:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
increases compared to the last biennium
 
03:04:07.010 --> 03:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
um transfers to other agencies including
 
03:04:09.309 --> 03:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
dot General Services
 
03:04:12.790 --> 03:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services
 
03:04:15.889 --> 03:04:15.899 align:start position:0%
in Department of Justice for their costs
 
03:04:15.899 --> 03:04:16.910 align:start position:0%
in Department of Justice for their costs
increase

03:04:16.910 --> 03:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
increase
 
03:04:19.269 --> 03:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
other other agencies were giving
 
03:04:21.349 --> 03:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
budgetary targets of a three percent
 
03:04:25.429 --> 03:04:25.439 align:start position:0%
increase we were given a level zero
 
03:04:28.070 --> 03:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
percent increase in our budget targets
 
03:04:28.080 --> 03:04:28.790 align:start position:0%
percent increase in our budget targets
um

03:04:28.790 --> 03:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:30.410 --> 03:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
but there are transfers to other
 
03:04:32.630 --> 03:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
agencies for support and stuff that we
 
03:04:35.750 --> 03:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
did we had identified those needs in the
 
03:04:38.630 --> 03:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
um in the additional needs column and
 
03:04:40.670 --> 03:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
they were funded in in the governor's
 
03:04:43.929 --> 03:04:43.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:47.929 --> 03:04:47.939 align:start position:0%
are we sticking with our 26 percent
 
03:04:51.950 --> 03:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
what's the 26 yeah for other agencies
 
03:04:55.730 --> 03:04:55.740 align:start position:0%
yes yeah yes yeah about that
 
03:05:00.710 --> 03:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a law isn't it yeah
 
03:05:03.290 --> 03:05:03.300 align:start position:0%
so the other thing representative Buco
 
03:05:05.090 --> 03:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
um you had asked about the fleet um one
 
03:05:07.010 --> 03:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
of the asks that we did have in the
 
03:05:08.269 --> 03:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
level funded
 
03:05:10.550 --> 03:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
um we we had um we had a request of
 
03:05:12.410 --> 03:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
about 10.4 million dollars over the
 
03:05:14.870 --> 03:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
biennium to sustain our Fleet
 
03:05:17.090 --> 03:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
Investments about
 
03:05:17.100 --> 03:05:17.750 align:start position:0%
Investments about
um

03:05:17.750 --> 03:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:20.030 --> 03:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
about two-thirds of that was funded in
 
03:05:22.610 --> 03:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
the budget for six million dollars
 
03:05:25.969 --> 03:05:25.979 align:start position:0%
um and and additional to that is also um
 
03:05:28.429 --> 03:05:28.439 align:start position:0%
the two hundred thousand dollars which
 
03:05:30.110 --> 03:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
go along with the vehicle purchases for
 
03:05:32.269 --> 03:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
vehicle um outfitting
 
03:05:34.969 --> 03:05:34.979 align:start position:0%
so those were the additional needs in
 
03:05:36.469 --> 03:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
the budget that were
 
03:05:37.790 --> 03:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
um included
 
03:05:43.969 --> 03:05:43.979 align:start position:0%
on page 23 I overview the um additional
 
03:05:46.429 --> 03:05:46.439 align:start position:0%
needs that we had identified in our
 
03:05:48.469 --> 03:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
agency budget request that were not
 
03:05:51.550 --> 03:05:51.560 align:start position:0%
funded we had identified
 
03:05:56.030 --> 03:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
about six Highway funded positions that
 
03:05:58.070 --> 03:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
that weren't funded
 
03:06:00.050 --> 03:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
um you know we'll we'll find ways to
 
03:06:01.870 --> 03:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
cover those needs
 
03:06:05.830 --> 03:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
the driveway permitting positions were
 
03:06:09.230 --> 03:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
an attempt to improve customer service
 
03:06:12.530 --> 03:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
improve and centralize the driveway
 
03:06:14.389 --> 03:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
permitting process it does have a lot of
 
03:06:17.929 --> 03:06:17.939 align:start position:0%
interaction with um with with uh with
 
03:06:20.330 --> 03:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
folks but um
 
03:06:24.830 --> 03:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:26.450 --> 03:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
like I said it was an improvement that
 
03:06:30.530 --> 03:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
that we have felt had Merit but um uh I
 
03:06:31.969 --> 03:06:31.979 align:start position:0%
it wasn't funded in the governor's
 
03:06:33.889 --> 03:06:33.899 align:start position:0%
budget will continue to address those
 
03:06:37.550 --> 03:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
needs with our existing uh resources
 
03:06:39.650 --> 03:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
um the next four bullets
 
03:06:41.570 --> 03:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
um identify you know what we had
 
03:06:44.630 --> 03:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
identified for cost increases
 
03:06:47.510 --> 03:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
um in uh you know inflationary impacts
 
03:06:50.870 --> 03:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
both in salt and Fuel and what we're
 
03:06:53.530 --> 03:06:53.540 align:start position:0%
paying for hired hired plows annually
 
03:06:57.769 --> 03:06:57.779 align:start position:0%
and increases in utility cost so those
 
03:06:57.779 --> 03:06:59.450 align:start position:0%
and increases in utility cost so those
costs

03:06:59.450 --> 03:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
costs
 
03:06:59.460 --> 03:07:00.769 align:start position:0%
costs
um

03:07:00.769 --> 03:07:00.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:05.330 --> 03:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
we we believed we were making a a good
 
03:07:07.490 --> 03:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
faith um
 
03:07:07.500 --> 03:07:09.590 align:start position:0%
faith um
uh

03:07:09.590 --> 03:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:07:13.190 --> 03:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
honest effort to reasonably
 
03:07:15.650 --> 03:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
um project and identify those costs that
 
03:07:19.429 --> 03:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
we think we uh could very well see in
 
03:07:22.790 --> 03:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
the next by biennium certainly we know
 
03:07:22.800 --> 03:07:23.750 align:start position:0%
the next by biennium certainly we know
um

03:07:23.750 --> 03:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:25.610 --> 03:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
um from looking backwards at the last
 
03:07:27.710 --> 03:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
biennium salt
 
03:07:27.720 --> 03:07:28.370 align:start position:0%
biennium salt
um

03:07:28.370 --> 03:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:30.590 --> 03:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
so road salt for example has increased
 
03:07:32.990 --> 03:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
about 54 percent we've seen that in our
 
03:07:35.389 --> 03:07:35.399 align:start position:0%
in our bids but we are not reflecting
 
03:07:38.990 --> 03:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
those additional costs as as as we go
 
03:07:41.330 --> 03:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
forward in this budget
 
03:07:41.340 --> 03:07:42.290 align:start position:0%
forward in this budget
um

03:07:42.290 --> 03:07:42.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:44.150 --> 03:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
for all the reasons that we had talked
 
03:07:44.160 --> 03:07:45.170 align:start position:0%
for all the reasons that we had talked
about

03:07:45.170 --> 03:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:07:46.670 --> 03:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
um before
 
03:07:46.680 --> 03:07:47.750 align:start position:0%
um before
um

03:07:47.750 --> 03:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:49.550 --> 03:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
its effect on the bottom line of the
 
03:07:52.070 --> 03:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
highway fund the
 
03:07:54.830 --> 03:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
um potential uncertainty of it
 
03:07:54.840 --> 03:07:56.030 align:start position:0%
um potential uncertainty of it
um but

03:07:56.030 --> 03:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
um but
 
03:07:56.040 --> 03:07:57.050 align:start position:0%
um but
um

03:07:57.050 --> 03:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:59.690 --> 03:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
we understand the volatility of the of
 
03:08:02.990 --> 03:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
of of of the projections but um we are
 
03:08:05.269 --> 03:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
concerned that when we if and when we do
 
03:08:05.279 --> 03:08:06.730 align:start position:0%
concerned that when we if and when we do
incorporate

03:08:06.730 --> 03:08:06.740 align:start position:0%
incorporate
 
03:08:09.410 --> 03:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
come across those inflationary impacts
 
03:08:10.849 --> 03:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
03:08:10.859 --> 03:08:11.690 align:start position:0%
that uh
um

03:08:11.690 --> 03:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:15.290 --> 03:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
uh we may not be able to address them
 
03:08:17.570 --> 03:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
so those were the bulk of the additional
 
03:08:19.849 --> 03:08:19.859 align:start position:0%
unfunded needs that we had identified
 
03:08:22.309 --> 03:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
and again they were primarily you know
 
03:08:26.330 --> 03:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
tied to inflationary aspects of of fuel
 
03:08:27.830 --> 03:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
and materials
 
03:08:30.410 --> 03:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
we did have and the last two bullets
 
03:08:30.420 --> 03:08:31.849 align:start position:0%
we did have and the last two bullets
there

03:08:31.849 --> 03:08:31.859 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:08:31.859 --> 03:08:32.450 align:start position:0%
there
um

03:08:32.450 --> 03:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:34.429 --> 03:08:34.439 align:start position:0%
I had mentioned on the fleet Investments
 
03:08:37.610 --> 03:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
we did have a request of about 10.4
 
03:08:40.550 --> 03:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars that was the level that
 
03:08:43.190 --> 03:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
we've identified that we feel we we need
 
03:08:46.910 --> 03:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
to invest in the fleet to um
 
03:08:49.969 --> 03:08:49.979 align:start position:0%
to keep it up and sustain and sustain
 
03:08:52.510 --> 03:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
the fleet without without losing ground
 
03:08:54.950 --> 03:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately in the governor's budget it
 
03:08:57.110 --> 03:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
was a little less than that which is
 
03:08:59.450 --> 03:08:59.460 align:start position:0%
which is which is great we'll we'll make
 
03:09:01.849 --> 03:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
do with what we have but in the past
 
03:09:03.370 --> 03:09:03.380 align:start position:0%
when we have under
 
03:09:05.990 --> 03:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
invested in the fleet
 
03:09:08.570 --> 03:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
um we have gotten really behind the
 
03:09:10.250 --> 03:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
eight ball by not keeping up with
 
03:09:13.790 --> 03:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
routine levels of of investment and
 
03:09:17.389 --> 03:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
keeping up with our equipment so
 
03:09:17.399 --> 03:09:18.349 align:start position:0%
keeping up with our equipment so
um

03:09:18.349 --> 03:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:22.130 --> 03:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
uh I guess at the end of this I'm
 
03:09:23.690 --> 03:09:23.700 align:start position:0%
concluding our presentation with the
 
03:09:26.570 --> 03:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
thought that it would be
 
03:09:28.969 --> 03:09:28.979 align:start position:0%
um you know we think it would be
 
03:09:33.530 --> 03:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
um very advantageous to continue the
 
03:09:36.349 --> 03:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
um investment in in the fleet to keep
 
03:09:39.170 --> 03:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
that and and ask for consideration of
 
03:09:41.090 --> 03:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
fully funding our Fleet investment
 
03:09:41.100 --> 03:09:43.389 align:start position:0%
fully funding our Fleet investment
request

03:09:43.389 --> 03:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
request
 
03:09:47.389 --> 03:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
well on a point uh so you're figuring is
 
03:09:49.070 --> 03:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
about 120 million dollars that's what
 
03:09:51.530 --> 03:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
you that's what your fleet's worth and
 
03:09:53.269 --> 03:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
to replace it every what probably 10
 
03:09:55.849 --> 03:09:55.859 align:start position:0%
years correct is that is that where that
 
03:09:58.309 --> 03:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
10.4 million comes comes from
 
03:10:00.590 --> 03:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
um I'll have Dave can speak to that a
 
03:10:03.530 --> 03:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
little bit more the next two slides well
 
03:10:05.990 --> 03:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
the final two slides
 
03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:06.710 align:start position:0%
the final two slides
um

03:10:06.710 --> 03:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:08.990 --> 03:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
you have some very specific
 
03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:10.309 align:start position:0%
you have some very specific
um

03:10:10.309 --> 03:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:13.130 --> 03:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
complete information but
 
03:10:15.830 --> 03:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
yes I think our y'all let you speak to
 
03:10:18.290 --> 03:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
it Dave and I'll follow up against
 
03:10:21.050 --> 03:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
probably this have you yeah and it's in
 
03:10:23.269 --> 03:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
the book okay
 
03:10:27.230 --> 03:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
have you uh find it hard to uh get
 
03:10:29.570 --> 03:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
supplies to build your trucks
 
03:10:33.650 --> 03:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
I mean it the supply chain specifically
 
03:10:36.290 --> 03:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
so yeah see the answer to that question
 
03:10:39.290 --> 03:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
is it's very difficult today number one
 
03:10:42.230 --> 03:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
to purchase a new vehicle and get it
 
03:10:45.050 --> 03:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
delivered number two when our existing
 
03:10:48.349 --> 03:10:48.359 align:start position:0%
Vehicles break down it's very difficult
 
03:10:51.290 --> 03:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
to get parts and sometimes we're delayed
 
03:10:54.290 --> 03:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
in the repair waiting for parts and then
 
03:10:56.870 --> 03:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
as as you point out
 
03:10:59.690 --> 03:10:59.700 align:start position:0%
um we do build our own trucks so we buy
 
03:11:02.630 --> 03:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
the the frame and Chassis we buy the
 
03:11:04.490 --> 03:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
dump bodies separate we buy the
 
03:11:07.370 --> 03:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
Hydraulics separate and build those and
 
03:11:09.530 --> 03:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
like all things that are delivered that
 
03:11:12.469 --> 03:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
takes a a little bit more time to today
 
03:11:16.070 --> 03:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
is as well which from my perspective is
 
03:11:19.370 --> 03:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
is all the more reason why we we keep up
 
03:11:20.990 --> 03:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
with it
 
03:11:23.090 --> 03:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
um we did give you these these budget
 
03:11:28.389 --> 03:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
books in on page 29 of the book
 
03:11:33.130 --> 03:11:33.140 align:start position:0%
is our Fleet statistics as of July 1st
 
03:11:36.590 --> 03:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
2022 and I want to show you this table
 
03:11:40.429 --> 03:11:40.439 align:start position:0%
because this table includes our expected
 
03:11:45.290 --> 03:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
age and our expected usage so as you can
 
03:11:45.300 --> 03:11:46.370 align:start position:0%
age and our expected usage so as you can
see

03:11:46.370 --> 03:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
see
 
03:11:49.070 --> 03:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
um those are the first two two columns
 
03:11:52.309 --> 03:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
after the descriptions as as you can see
 
03:11:54.710 --> 03:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
each of our pieces
 
03:11:58.010 --> 03:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
um depending on the type may have a an
 
03:12:01.910 --> 03:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
estimated expected life of 15 years 12
 
03:12:01.920 --> 03:12:03.710 align:start position:0%
estimated expected life of 15 years 12
years

03:12:03.710 --> 03:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:12:07.610 --> 03:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
um some uh 10 years in summer six and
 
03:12:10.910 --> 03:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
and eight so when we come up with the
 
03:12:14.090 --> 03:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
actual budget cost it's a a real
 
03:12:18.410 --> 03:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
calculation based on our entire fleet
 
03:12:21.950 --> 03:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
composition as is summarized on on this
 
03:12:21.960 --> 03:12:23.269 align:start position:0%
composition as is summarized on on this
sheet

03:12:23.269 --> 03:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
sheet
 
03:12:26.450 --> 03:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense
 
03:12:29.870 --> 03:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
and we do have a a slide that speaks to
 
03:12:31.969 --> 03:12:31.979 align:start position:0%
that that's that's a little bit larger
 
03:12:34.550 --> 03:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
but it we don't have an included the
 
03:12:38.510 --> 03:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
expected age in that but
 
03:12:47.090 --> 03:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:50.330 --> 03:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
yes certainly so um
 
03:12:52.130 --> 03:12:52.140 align:start position:0%
I've hit on a number of these things so
 
03:12:54.590 --> 03:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
the very last slide slide 24 to sum sum
 
03:12:56.090 --> 03:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
things up
 
03:12:57.650 --> 03:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
um I talked about the highway fund
 
03:13:00.050 --> 03:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
Revenue situation and the structural and
 
03:13:00.060 --> 03:13:01.849 align:start position:0%
Revenue situation and the structural and
solvency

03:13:01.849 --> 03:13:01.859 align:start position:0%
solvency
 
03:13:04.849 --> 03:13:04.859 align:start position:0%
um and we are still uh challenged with
 
03:13:07.070 --> 03:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
employee retention looking at a current
 
03:13:10.910 --> 03:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
current vacancy rate of over 25 percent
 
03:13:10.920 --> 03:13:11.990 align:start position:0%
current vacancy rate of over 25 percent
um

03:13:11.990 --> 03:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:13.849 --> 03:13:13.859 align:start position:0%
on the operations and maintenance side
 
03:13:15.410 --> 03:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:13:17.929 --> 03:13:17.939 align:start position:0%
a big part of that high vacancy rate I
 
03:13:19.370 --> 03:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
think is
 
03:13:21.170 --> 03:13:21.180 align:start position:0%
um you know attributed to our
 
03:13:22.910 --> 03:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
non-competitive salaries and hopefully
 
03:13:25.610 --> 03:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
the 10 percent uh raise in the budget is
 
03:13:26.809 --> 03:13:26.819 align:start position:0%
going to help
 
03:13:29.150 --> 03:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
um address that
 
03:13:32.929 --> 03:13:32.939 align:start position:0%
um we have had some declining service
 
03:13:34.969 --> 03:13:34.979 align:start position:0%
levels in a number of areas in past
 
03:13:37.910 --> 03:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
budget years we have identified program
 
03:13:39.830 --> 03:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
needs for
 
03:13:43.309 --> 03:13:43.319 align:start position:0%
um tree removal and Mowing and graffiti
 
03:13:44.809 --> 03:13:44.819 align:start position:0%
removal and some of those needs that
 
03:13:48.170 --> 03:13:48.180 align:start position:0%
that we have that we have
 
03:13:50.630 --> 03:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
identified but have not been able to get
 
03:13:50.640 --> 03:13:51.889 align:start position:0%
identified but have not been able to get
to

03:13:51.889 --> 03:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:13:51.899 --> 03:13:53.809 align:start position:0%
to
um

03:13:53.809 --> 03:13:53.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
in past and and past budgets those have
 
03:13:59.510 --> 03:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
not been been funded
 
03:13:59.520 --> 03:14:00.349 align:start position:0%
not been been funded
um

03:14:00.349 --> 03:14:00.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:03.170 --> 03:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
but they are still very real
 
03:14:05.570 --> 03:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
um very real needs
 
03:14:05.580 --> 03:14:06.530 align:start position:0%
um very real needs
um

03:14:06.530 --> 03:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:11.750 --> 03:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't we didn't put those types of
 
03:14:13.790 --> 03:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
um requests and our additional needs and
 
03:14:16.490 --> 03:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
and the budget here this time primarily
 
03:14:19.190 --> 03:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
because of the vacancy rate
 
03:14:21.349 --> 03:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
um and and you know we need to focus on
 
03:14:24.349 --> 03:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
rebuilding and taking care of what we
 
03:14:24.359 --> 03:14:25.550 align:start position:0%
rebuilding and taking care of what we
have

03:14:25.550 --> 03:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:14:27.650 --> 03:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
um first and foremost before before
 
03:14:30.170 --> 03:14:30.180 align:start position:0%
adding more but
 
03:14:30.180 --> 03:14:31.010 align:start position:0%
adding more but
um

03:14:31.010 --> 03:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:32.809 --> 03:14:32.819 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to leave the impression
 
03:14:35.389 --> 03:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
that with level funding and and some of
 
03:14:38.389 --> 03:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
those things that that everything is is
 
03:14:40.490 --> 03:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
um finding good because there are still
 
03:14:44.510 --> 03:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh some of these needs that
 
03:14:45.889 --> 03:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
um the reasons I mentioned we haven't
 
03:14:48.590 --> 03:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
identified but they are still
 
03:14:48.600 --> 03:14:49.190 align:start position:0%
identified but they are still
um

03:14:49.190 --> 03:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:52.670 --> 03:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
they are still very real real needs
 
03:14:52.680 --> 03:14:54.110 align:start position:0%
they are still very real real needs
um

03:14:54.110 --> 03:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:56.450 --> 03:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
and they are long-term challenges for us
 
03:14:59.330 --> 03:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
to to address
 
03:14:59.340 --> 03:14:59.990 align:start position:0%
to to address
um

03:14:59.990 --> 03:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:02.090 --> 03:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
so some of the things there
 
03:15:04.190 --> 03:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
um we've talked about the fleet under
 
03:15:07.910 --> 03:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
budgeting we've talked about the
 
03:15:10.190 --> 03:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
the backlogs and driveway permitting we
 
03:15:12.410 --> 03:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
tried to identify some some resources to
 
03:15:15.110 --> 03:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
address that but um we'll we'll keep
 
03:15:17.809 --> 03:15:17.819 align:start position:0%
trying to address it as best we can
 
03:15:17.819 --> 03:15:18.650 align:start position:0%
trying to address it as best we can
um

03:15:18.650 --> 03:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:21.010 --> 03:15:21.020 align:start position:0%
I had mentioned the
 
03:15:25.429 --> 03:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
looming loss of SB 367 Revenue toward
 
03:15:29.929 --> 03:15:29.939 align:start position:0%
Paving and bridges ending after 2025
 
03:15:31.910 --> 03:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
um and through some of the questions
 
03:15:33.650 --> 03:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
we've addressed The Limited State
 
03:15:36.070 --> 03:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
funding for non-federal Aid eligible
 
03:15:38.809 --> 03:15:38.819 align:start position:0%
state roads
 
03:15:38.819 --> 03:15:39.969 align:start position:0%
state roads
um

03:15:39.969 --> 03:15:39.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:42.650 --> 03:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
long-term State funding for rural and
 
03:15:45.530 --> 03:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
urban Transportation Urban Transit
 
03:15:49.429 --> 03:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
programs is going to continue to be a a
 
03:15:51.530 --> 03:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
need as well
 
03:15:54.710 --> 03:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
um and and in the very long term we
 
03:15:58.070 --> 03:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
still do not bring much State dollars to
 
03:15:59.809 --> 03:15:59.819 align:start position:0%
match the federal program compared to
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
other states we rely on
 
03:16:02.399 --> 03:16:03.550 align:start position:0%
other states we rely on
um

03:16:03.550 --> 03:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:06.769 --> 03:16:06.779 align:start position:0%
Turnpike toll credits to utilize our
 
03:16:08.210 --> 03:16:08.220 align:start position:0%
federal funds at a hundred percent
 
03:16:11.929 --> 03:16:11.939 align:start position:0%
versus the typical uh 20 match that is
 
03:16:14.330 --> 03:16:14.340 align:start position:0%
that is required
 
03:16:16.429 --> 03:16:16.439 align:start position:0%
um and uh and then the long term with
 
03:16:19.670 --> 03:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
the declining waterfall and the SB 367 I
 
03:16:21.349 --> 03:16:21.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned the declining funding toward
 
03:16:23.809 --> 03:16:23.819 align:start position:0%
the state aid bridge program as well too
 
03:16:26.030 --> 03:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
so those are some of the longer term
 
03:16:26.040 --> 03:16:27.950 align:start position:0%
so those are some of the longer term
challenges

03:16:27.950 --> 03:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
03:16:27.960 --> 03:16:28.910 align:start position:0%
challenges
um

03:16:28.910 --> 03:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:31.610 --> 03:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
that I just want to place on on on on
 
03:16:33.469 --> 03:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
your awareness as we go through through
 
03:16:35.090 --> 03:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
03:16:38.210 --> 03:16:38.220 align:start position:0%
um mainly for ratification and and
 
03:16:38.220 --> 03:16:40.070 align:start position:0%
um mainly for ratification and and
um

03:16:40.070 --> 03:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:42.710 --> 03:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
in your information so
 
03:16:45.130 --> 03:16:45.140 align:start position:0%
well I think a comment you made early on
 
03:16:47.690 --> 03:16:47.700 align:start position:0%
certainly applies and that is you can't
 
03:16:50.030 --> 03:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
you can't live for the laps
 
03:16:52.190 --> 03:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
right you know I think I think your
 
03:16:54.469 --> 03:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
lapse is going to start shrinking
 
03:16:57.170 --> 03:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
by necessity right
 
03:16:58.969 --> 03:16:58.979 align:start position:0%
because you can't deliver what you need
 
03:17:02.090 --> 03:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
to deliver with what you got
 
03:17:04.490 --> 03:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
right I agree
 
03:17:05.929 --> 03:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
that was the point we're trying to make
 
03:17:08.990 --> 03:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
with with one of the concerns with the
 
03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:10.070 align:start position:0%
with with one of the concerns with the
um

03:17:10.070 --> 03:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:11.929 --> 03:17:11.939 align:start position:0%
Circle statement as it's reflected
 
03:17:13.910 --> 03:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
currently yeah because tradition isn't
 
03:17:16.730 --> 03:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
the lamps right
 
03:17:19.910 --> 03:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
yeah we like some of the sb2 that says
 
03:17:21.889 --> 03:17:21.899 align:start position:0%
the lapse we have to do we don't have to
 
03:17:24.410 --> 03:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
fix the roads right right yeah
 
03:17:27.170 --> 03:17:27.180 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:17:27.180 --> 03:17:30.170 align:start position:0%
any other questions
huh

03:17:30.170 --> 03:17:30.180 align:start position:0%
huh
 
03:17:30.180 --> 03:17:31.550 align:start position:0%
huh
uh

03:17:31.550 --> 03:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:17:33.830 --> 03:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
I just want to recall that during the
 
03:17:37.330 --> 03:17:37.340 align:start position:0%
last budget cycle we had to um
 
03:17:42.110 --> 03:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
subsidize the the fleet with
 
03:17:44.090 --> 03:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
I I think it was actually Capital
 
03:17:47.210 --> 03:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
funding that we we used
 
03:17:51.710 --> 03:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
we can't um you know you know we can't
 
03:17:53.809 --> 03:17:53.819 align:start position:0%
you can't the department can't operate
 
03:17:55.790 --> 03:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't have a fleet if it doesn't
 
03:17:57.769 --> 03:17:57.779 align:start position:0%
have vehicles
 
03:18:00.290 --> 03:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
right and I I would like to comment I I
 
03:18:01.969 --> 03:18:01.979 align:start position:0%
probably didn't articulate that well
 
03:18:03.769 --> 03:18:03.779 align:start position:0%
when I said it but that that that's
 
03:18:05.870 --> 03:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
that's that representative Buco is one
 
03:18:07.849 --> 03:18:07.859 align:start position:0%
of the primary reasons that that we are
 
03:18:10.490 --> 03:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
advocating for fully funding our Fleet
 
03:18:12.170 --> 03:18:12.180 align:start position:0%
request because
 
03:18:14.389 --> 03:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
um the legislature over the past few
 
03:18:16.250 --> 03:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
budgets has been very good through
 
03:18:19.010 --> 03:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
through a mix of of operating budget and
 
03:18:21.230 --> 03:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
03:18:23.269 --> 03:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
um allowing us to kind of claw back and
 
03:18:26.870 --> 03:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
build back up the fleet investment so
 
03:18:30.110 --> 03:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
um it's it we we would we would hate to
 
03:18:31.370 --> 03:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
see that
 
03:18:31.380 --> 03:18:32.450 align:start position:0%
see that
um

03:18:32.450 --> 03:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:34.790 --> 03:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
that investment diminished by not
 
03:18:37.190 --> 03:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
keeping up with it right right right and
 
03:18:39.650 --> 03:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
and you know it's it's just like
 
03:18:41.210 --> 03:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
Building Maintenance you know you can't
 
03:18:42.650 --> 03:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
if you don't we don't maintain it then
 
03:18:44.510 --> 03:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to end up having to buy buy
 
03:18:47.929 --> 03:18:47.939 align:start position:0%
whole new trucks instead of keeping up
 
03:18:49.309 --> 03:18:49.319 align:start position:0%
what we have
 
03:18:54.230 --> 03:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:56.570 --> 03:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and apologies for
 
03:18:59.870 --> 03:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
being late I had a bill that took way
 
03:19:03.110 --> 03:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
longer than I meant to I apologize just
 
03:19:04.610 --> 03:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
a quick question of course a lot of your
 
03:19:07.010 --> 03:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
concerns are because of the funding for
 
03:19:08.750 --> 03:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
the highway finders affected by the
 
03:19:10.490 --> 03:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
changing the mix of vehicles and all
 
03:19:13.250 --> 03:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
that there are bills that obviously are
 
03:19:15.410 --> 03:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
attempting to fix that even by forming a
 
03:19:17.750 --> 03:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
committee or by fixing it so what are
 
03:19:19.370 --> 03:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on how should the
 
03:19:22.250 --> 03:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
legislator go about you know
 
03:19:24.950 --> 03:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
properly taxing the people who use our
 
03:19:29.870 --> 03:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:29.880 --> 03:19:32.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:19:32.750 --> 03:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:35.990 --> 03:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind I'd kind of answer not
 
03:19:37.790 --> 03:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily as the commissioner of dot
 
03:19:39.590 --> 03:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
but a little bit more of a personal type
 
03:19:42.590 --> 03:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
of opinion because I I don't know if we
 
03:19:44.450 --> 03:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
as an agency have
 
03:19:44.460 --> 03:19:45.889 align:start position:0%
as an agency have
um

03:19:45.889 --> 03:19:45.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:48.590 --> 03:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
you know formulated a policy well what
 
03:19:50.510 --> 03:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
we have I mean I would say as a as an
 
03:19:53.570 --> 03:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
agency we're relatively agnostic we can
 
03:19:55.490 --> 03:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
identify the needs
 
03:19:57.710 --> 03:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
um and and and how best to address those
 
03:19:59.510 --> 03:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
needs funding wise becomes you know more
 
03:20:01.730 --> 03:20:01.740 align:start position:0%
of the policy makers prerogative I do
 
03:20:04.370 --> 03:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
think you know personally in a following
 
03:20:07.130 --> 03:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
it that that things such as the
 
03:20:09.710 --> 03:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
um that the road user fee
 
03:20:11.929 --> 03:20:11.939 align:start position:0%
um things like that which get at
 
03:20:15.710 --> 03:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
um equitability of funding um do make do
 
03:20:17.450 --> 03:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
make sense to me
 
03:20:20.269 --> 03:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
um there is an argument to make that you
 
03:20:22.250 --> 03:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
know a road user fee whether based on
 
03:20:25.910 --> 03:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
registration of some sort does fall a
 
03:20:27.349 --> 03:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
little more
 
03:20:31.309 --> 03:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
um heavily on you know the in-state
 
03:20:31.319 --> 03:20:32.090 align:start position:0%
um heavily on you know the in-state
um

03:20:32.090 --> 03:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:34.010 --> 03:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
you know in in state people and doesn't
 
03:20:34.020 --> 03:20:35.389 align:start position:0%
you know in in state people and doesn't
necessarily

03:20:35.389 --> 03:20:35.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
03:20:37.610 --> 03:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
take into account you know the tourism
 
03:20:39.230 --> 03:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
traffic that are used in our our
 
03:20:42.290 --> 03:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
highways as well too so
 
03:20:42.300 --> 03:20:43.130 align:start position:0%
highways as well too so
um

03:20:43.130 --> 03:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:45.230 --> 03:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh around the country particularly in
 
03:20:48.170 --> 03:20:48.180 align:start position:0%
the West Oregon Washington and those
 
03:20:51.349 --> 03:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
areas are looking very hard at much more
 
03:20:55.070 --> 03:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
again that that equitability standpoint
 
03:20:59.510 --> 03:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
of of of vehicle miles traveled type of
 
03:20:59.520 --> 03:21:00.830 align:start position:0%
of of of vehicle miles traveled type of
model

03:21:00.830 --> 03:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
model
 
03:21:00.840 --> 03:21:01.790 align:start position:0%
model
um

03:21:01.790 --> 03:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:04.190 --> 03:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
there are some pluses and minus with
 
03:21:07.250 --> 03:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
that depending on your outlook
 
03:21:10.969 --> 03:21:10.979 align:start position:0%
but again getting back to equity
 
03:21:13.670 --> 03:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
somehow some some some
 
03:21:13.680 --> 03:21:16.010 align:start position:0%
somehow some some some
uh

03:21:16.010 --> 03:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:21:19.670 --> 03:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
payment of by how frequently or how much
 
03:21:22.670 --> 03:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
you use the transportation system
 
03:21:22.680 --> 03:21:23.450 align:start position:0%
you use the transportation system
um

03:21:23.450 --> 03:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:25.370 --> 03:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
would seem to make sense and I think is
 
03:21:27.889 --> 03:21:27.899 align:start position:0%
in in keeping with the
 
03:21:30.349 --> 03:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
um original intent of of the of the
 
03:21:32.450 --> 03:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
highway fund which was set up to be a a
 
03:21:34.130 --> 03:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
user fee you know through the through
 
03:21:37.490 --> 03:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
the circuit of usage of gasoline so
 
03:21:41.389 --> 03:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:43.309 --> 03:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
yeah I have two questions thank you and
 
03:21:44.510 --> 03:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
you can probably guess the second one
 
03:21:44.520 --> 03:21:45.830 align:start position:0%
you can probably guess the second one
but

03:21:45.830 --> 03:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:21:47.450 --> 03:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
um what are your discussions around
 
03:21:49.969 --> 03:21:49.979 align:start position:0%
raising some of the tolls how was the
 
03:21:52.070 --> 03:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
last time tolls have been raised and my
 
03:21:54.110 --> 03:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
second question is any anticipated plans
 
03:21:57.950 --> 03:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:57.960 --> 03:22:00.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:22:00.650 --> 03:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:02.690 --> 03:22:02.700 align:start position:0%
I think the last time the toll structure
 
03:22:07.670 --> 03:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
was Ray was was changed was in uh 2009
 
03:22:10.250 --> 03:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
um when when the tolls were raised to
 
03:22:11.630 --> 03:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
um you know support the capital program
 
03:22:14.030 --> 03:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
that that we uh that we have planned out
 
03:22:14.040 --> 03:22:15.830 align:start position:0%
that that we uh that we have planned out
today

03:22:15.830 --> 03:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:22:15.840 --> 03:22:16.429 align:start position:0%
today
um

03:22:16.429 --> 03:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:18.410 --> 03:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
we have not broached any discussions
 
03:22:21.710 --> 03:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
about uh toll increases others have
 
03:22:24.410 --> 03:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
suggested it certainly as you compare to
 
03:22:27.830 --> 03:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
other other other states New Hampshire
 
03:22:31.490 --> 03:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
is one of the uh lowest in terms of toll
 
03:22:33.469 --> 03:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
rates but um
 
03:22:36.050 --> 03:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
as we just as we get into the 10-year
 
03:22:38.750 --> 03:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
plan any changes to the 10-year plan
 
03:22:40.429 --> 03:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
um there are changes every every every
 
03:22:43.309 --> 03:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
two years so we'll have to see
 
03:22:46.630 --> 03:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
um you know how that goes like I said
 
03:22:48.910 --> 03:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
our our
 
03:22:52.309 --> 03:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
our goal is is to present the needs and
 
03:22:53.990 --> 03:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
what we can do with the existing funding
 
03:22:56.210 --> 03:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
we have and to maybe suggest some ideas
 
03:22:59.570 --> 03:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
of what could be done to either offset
 
03:23:01.730 --> 03:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
or compensate that
 
03:23:01.740 --> 03:23:02.990 align:start position:0%
or compensate that
um

03:23:02.990 --> 03:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:04.610 --> 03:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
I think it was about four years ago
 
03:23:06.710 --> 03:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
through the 10-year plan process with
 
03:23:08.750 --> 03:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
some of the questions
 
03:23:08.760 --> 03:23:09.349 align:start position:0%
some of the questions
um

03:23:09.349 --> 03:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:11.510 --> 03:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
about redless bridges particularly on
 
03:23:13.130 --> 03:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
the turnpike with some of the turnpike
 
03:23:16.729 --> 03:23:16.739 align:start position:0%
Capital needs there was a um there was
 
03:23:18.889 --> 03:23:18.899 align:start position:0%
we were asked by the executive Council
 
03:23:23.269 --> 03:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
to look at what it would take to um
 
03:23:25.070 --> 03:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
fund the capital program more
 
03:23:28.070 --> 03:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
ambitiously and we did review and put
 
03:23:31.969 --> 03:23:31.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:34.969 --> 03:23:34.979 align:start position:0%
a toll increased package that that could
 
03:23:37.610 --> 03:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
support that and through the through the
 
03:23:39.110 --> 03:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
10-year plan process and through the
 
03:23:42.349 --> 03:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
governor and executive Council it it was
 
03:23:44.750 --> 03:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
not passed so
 
03:23:44.760 --> 03:23:45.769 align:start position:0%
not passed so
um

03:23:45.769 --> 03:23:45.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:47.750 --> 03:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
whether similar questions come up at
 
03:23:49.790 --> 03:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
this 10 10-year plan or not
 
03:23:52.849 --> 03:23:52.859 align:start position:0%
um I I can't say when Dave was talking
 
03:23:55.210 --> 03:23:55.220 align:start position:0%
about particularly the turnpike program
 
03:23:58.370 --> 03:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
we do have some very Stark decisions to
 
03:24:00.889 --> 03:24:00.899 align:start position:0%
make on either our priorities what's
 
03:24:03.290 --> 03:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
going to be done or or what's not going
 
03:24:07.790 --> 03:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:13.969 --> 03:24:13.979 align:start position:0%
um I think it is within our Realm to
 
03:24:16.490 --> 03:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
raise the totals
 
03:24:20.929 --> 03:24:20.939 align:start position:0%
um if we were to raise them by a dollar
 
03:24:23.630 --> 03:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
so it would be two dollars
 
03:24:25.250 --> 03:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
going both ways now that I have my easy
 
03:24:27.889 --> 03:24:27.899 align:start position:0%
pass I never know what it is
 
03:24:27.899 --> 03:24:28.990 align:start position:0%
pass I never know what it is
um

03:24:28.990 --> 03:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:32.090 --> 03:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
what in the top of your head could you
 
03:24:33.950 --> 03:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
do a quick estimate on how much money
 
03:24:37.370 --> 03:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:40.370 --> 03:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
um not not in my head I can go back and
 
03:24:42.410 --> 03:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
ask the question I would point out
 
03:24:45.349 --> 03:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
representative that uh by Statute the
 
03:24:47.450 --> 03:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
toll rates are governed by the executive
 
03:24:50.750 --> 03:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
Council the toll locations and and where
 
03:24:52.729 --> 03:24:52.739 align:start position:0%
there are or aren't
 
03:24:55.910 --> 03:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
um toll plazas are um seems like we have
 
03:24:58.190 --> 03:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
done it before they had they lacked the
 
03:25:01.190 --> 03:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
gumption to raise the tolls so we did it
 
03:25:02.750 --> 03:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
03:25:04.670 --> 03:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
through the legislation
 
03:25:07.510 --> 03:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
maybe an hb2
 
03:25:11.150 --> 03:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
I'm I I know all the discussions that we
 
03:25:12.889 --> 03:25:12.899 align:start position:0%
have had it's been very very very
 
03:25:14.990 --> 03:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
clearly stated that governor and Council
 
03:25:17.570 --> 03:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
control the toll rates toll locations
 
03:25:20.450 --> 03:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
and and boy the plazas are located
 
03:25:22.490 --> 03:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
um that came up recently with Merrimack
 
03:25:24.889 --> 03:25:24.899 align:start position:0%
tolls that it was uh the executive
 
03:25:27.349 --> 03:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
Council who voted to
 
03:25:30.349 --> 03:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
um zero out the uh the toll rates they
 
03:25:31.490 --> 03:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
couldn't eliminate the tolls because
 
03:25:33.950 --> 03:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
that the toll plaza locations are at the
 
03:25:36.170 --> 03:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
discretion of the legislature but they
 
03:25:37.790 --> 03:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
could set a zero
 
03:25:39.650 --> 03:25:39.660 align:start position:0%
um a zero rate at those tolls and
 
03:25:42.610 --> 03:25:42.620 align:start position:0%
ultimately then on the two areas in
 
03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
Merrimack have been removed so thank you
 
03:25:48.110 --> 03:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
you're welcome right uh thank you Mr
 
03:25:48.120 --> 03:25:49.130 align:start position:0%
you're welcome right uh thank you Mr
chairman

03:25:49.130 --> 03:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:25:49.140 --> 03:25:50.450 align:start position:0%
chairman
now

03:25:50.450 --> 03:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:25:52.610 --> 03:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
does the turnpike
 
03:25:52.620 --> 03:25:54.410 align:start position:0%
does the turnpike
revenues

03:25:54.410 --> 03:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
03:25:56.870 --> 03:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
cover all the cost of the turnpikes
 
03:25:58.790 --> 03:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
because you can't you can't use that
 
03:26:00.710 --> 03:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
money for other places correct correct
 
03:26:03.830 --> 03:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
so yes it does it does so in other words
 
03:26:05.990 --> 03:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
raising the tolls you're just going to
 
03:26:10.330 --> 03:26:10.340 align:start position:0%
increase that that part of money so the
 
03:26:14.389 --> 03:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
the when David pointed out the um the
 
03:26:14.399 --> 03:26:17.150 align:start position:0%
the when David pointed out the um the
waterfall

03:26:17.150 --> 03:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:17.160 --> 03:26:20.210 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:26:20.210 --> 03:26:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:22.370 --> 03:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna just find the right slide so
 
03:26:27.170 --> 03:26:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:27.180 --> 03:26:28.130 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:26:28.130 --> 03:26:28.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:28.140 --> 03:26:29.750 align:start position:0%
um
nope

03:26:29.750 --> 03:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
nope
 
03:26:29.760 --> 03:26:31.490 align:start position:0%
nope
12.

03:26:31.490 --> 03:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
12.
 
03:26:33.110 --> 03:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
so the waterfall for the for the
 
03:26:35.330 --> 03:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
turnpike revenues go towards and I think
 
03:26:37.190 --> 03:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
it stated it wrong I think first and
 
03:26:38.690 --> 03:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
foremost it goes to pay the debt service
 
03:26:40.490 --> 03:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
The Debt Service comes off the top to
 
03:26:42.170 --> 03:26:42.180 align:start position:0%
the bonds that have built the turnpike
 
03:26:43.729 --> 03:26:43.739 align:start position:0%
system to date
 
03:26:45.170 --> 03:26:45.180 align:start position:0%
um then it's operating in maintenance
 
03:26:48.769 --> 03:26:48.779 align:start position:0%
cost then there is a certain level of r
 
03:26:50.870 --> 03:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
r which is uh Rehabilitation and
 
03:26:52.870 --> 03:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
restoration that we have to put in
 
03:26:56.530 --> 03:26:56.540 align:start position:0%
satisfy the bondholders and keep the
 
03:26:59.269 --> 03:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
turnpike in good working order so the
 
03:27:01.309 --> 03:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
toll revenues that we have today do
 
03:27:01.319 --> 03:27:02.630 align:start position:0%
toll revenues that we have today do
cover

03:27:02.630 --> 03:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
cover
 
03:27:05.269 --> 03:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
um all three of those needs The Debt
 
03:27:06.830 --> 03:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
Service the operation and maintenance
 
03:27:09.710 --> 03:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
and the r r work where we fall short
 
03:27:12.110 --> 03:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
then and and what's the last thing that
 
03:27:14.150 --> 03:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
gets funded are the of those of those
 
03:27:16.370 --> 03:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
Capital needs those bigger projects to
 
03:27:19.010 --> 03:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
either widen the Epi Everett Turnpike or
 
03:27:22.070 --> 03:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
redo the interchanges that uh exit six
 
03:27:25.250 --> 03:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
and seven things things like that so
 
03:27:28.250 --> 03:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
um and those are driven by by cash flow
 
03:27:31.070 --> 03:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
so after after
 
03:27:33.050 --> 03:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
operations and maintenance after The
 
03:27:36.229 --> 03:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
Debt Service after the r r work are
 
03:27:39.050 --> 03:27:39.060 align:start position:0%
funded whatever is left you know can
 
03:27:41.570 --> 03:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
then go to Capital
 
03:27:43.790 --> 03:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
um as operation and maintenance costs go
 
03:27:47.630 --> 03:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
up as RNR work goes up there's less and
 
03:27:49.729 --> 03:27:49.739 align:start position:0%
less of available each year for Capital
 
03:27:52.490 --> 03:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
funds so the cash flow for those capital
 
03:27:54.889 --> 03:27:54.899 align:start position:0%
projects just extends out further and
 
03:27:54.899 --> 03:27:56.210 align:start position:0%
projects just extends out further and
further

03:27:56.210 --> 03:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
further
 
03:27:59.809 --> 03:27:59.819 align:start position:0%
so and the answer to your question
 
03:28:02.269 --> 03:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
the turnpike revenue does does cover the
 
03:28:05.090 --> 03:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
needs of of the turnpike it depends on
 
03:28:08.269 --> 03:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
the capital needs whether you uh view
 
03:28:10.130 --> 03:28:10.140 align:start position:0%
those as a
 
03:28:13.729 --> 03:28:13.739 align:start position:0%
as a priority or a discretionary kind of
 
03:28:13.739 --> 03:28:14.809 align:start position:0%
as a priority or a discretionary kind of
need

03:28:14.809 --> 03:28:14.819 align:start position:0%
need
 
03:28:18.530 --> 03:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
a follow-up the bond can it is that a
 
03:28:21.050 --> 03:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
fixed amount uh term
 
03:28:24.290 --> 03:28:24.300 align:start position:0%
uh in other words turn to 2035 in other
 
03:28:26.150 --> 03:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
words we have to pay it till 2035
 
03:28:28.910 --> 03:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
because of the bond is usually fixed
 
03:28:32.510 --> 03:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
that way yes it is thank you
 
03:28:35.269 --> 03:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair quick question covert
 
03:28:39.469 --> 03:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
really did a job on your total funds
 
03:28:42.710 --> 03:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
um could you use apple money to replace
 
03:28:47.750 --> 03:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
any of that and based on your chart you
 
03:28:51.530 --> 03:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
can't expect the long-term revenues to
 
03:28:53.809 --> 03:28:53.819 align:start position:0%
come up again because they've leveled up
 
03:28:55.610 --> 03:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
because more people are still working it
 
03:28:57.769 --> 03:28:57.779 align:start position:0%
from home and that seems to become the
 
03:29:00.889 --> 03:29:00.899 align:start position:0%
status quo so we really need to think
 
03:29:02.330 --> 03:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
about something
 
03:29:04.729 --> 03:29:04.739 align:start position:0%
how I mean how are you going to continue
 
03:29:07.670 --> 03:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
to exist right
 
03:29:11.150 --> 03:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
um I I do believe that Opera funds could
 
03:29:14.510 --> 03:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
be used for replacing lost Revenue not
 
03:29:16.309 --> 03:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily the
 
03:29:18.889 --> 03:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
the cost Delta going going forward but
 
03:29:20.150 --> 03:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
certainly for
 
03:29:22.309 --> 03:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
um for lost Revenue incurred during that
 
03:29:23.870 --> 03:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
time but
 
03:29:23.880 --> 03:29:24.769 align:start position:0%
time but
um

03:29:24.769 --> 03:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:27.250 --> 03:29:27.260 align:start position:0%
no And as far as going forward
 
03:29:29.990 --> 03:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
the strategy to date with that with with
 
03:29:32.090 --> 03:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
without the wherewithal to consider a
 
03:29:34.910 --> 03:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
toll increase or or or or or other
 
03:29:38.389 --> 03:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
infusion of funds you know has been to
 
03:29:38.399 --> 03:29:39.410 align:start position:0%
infusion of funds you know has been to
um

03:29:39.410 --> 03:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:42.229 --> 03:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
be judicious with the capital projects
 
03:29:44.030 --> 03:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
and and we've been honest through the
 
03:29:46.130 --> 03:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
10-year plan projects uh through the
 
03:29:50.269 --> 03:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
10-year plan process of of of
 
03:29:52.670 --> 03:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
what can be done and what and what can't
 
03:29:55.610 --> 03:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
be done and you know as we push those
 
03:29:58.610 --> 03:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
projects out further or or maybe not do
 
03:30:00.349 --> 03:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
them at all
 
03:30:02.450 --> 03:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
um we'll have to have a weighing of of
 
03:30:04.250 --> 03:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
if that's acceptable if that's an
 
03:30:06.530 --> 03:30:06.540 align:start position:0%
acceptable level of service or not
 
03:30:06.540 --> 03:30:07.250 align:start position:0%
acceptable level of service or not
um

03:30:07.250 --> 03:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:10.729 --> 03:30:10.739 align:start position:0%
well what New Hampshire depends on
 
03:30:14.450 --> 03:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
tourism it's a huge revenue for us and
 
03:30:18.110 --> 03:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
without a good system of Roads
 
03:30:20.809 --> 03:30:20.819 align:start position:0%
Turnpike especially
 
03:30:22.790 --> 03:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
um I think maybe we're being a little
 
03:30:25.670 --> 03:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
silly not to think more aggressively
 
03:30:28.130 --> 03:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
about raising the tolls then
 
03:30:30.469 --> 03:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
I need to call somebody and find out how
 
03:30:34.969 --> 03:30:34.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:37.790 --> 03:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
so we've had a lot of talk over in
 
03:30:39.950 --> 03:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
division one about the uh
 
03:30:44.269 --> 03:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
exit 4A yes and they want us to tell you
 
03:30:47.210 --> 03:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
to get going on it right now
 
03:30:49.370 --> 03:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
what's the odds it's going to get worked
 
03:30:51.469 --> 03:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
on soon
 
03:30:54.410 --> 03:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
well exit 4A is continually to be worked
 
03:30:56.210 --> 03:30:56.220 align:start position:0%
on one of the first contracts is
 
03:30:58.370 --> 03:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
presently under construction if you
 
03:31:01.309 --> 03:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
drive down 93 the next contract we're
 
03:31:04.370 --> 03:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
trying very hard to get out the door
 
03:31:04.380 --> 03:31:05.750 align:start position:0%
trying very hard to get out the door
um

03:31:05.750 --> 03:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:10.250 --> 03:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:11.929 --> 03:31:11.939 align:start position:0%
and there was some talk about you
 
03:31:13.429 --> 03:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
haven't even bought all the property yet
 
03:31:15.590 --> 03:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
that you need right
 
03:31:17.809 --> 03:31:17.819 align:start position:0%
now that that's that's that's whether or
 
03:31:19.849 --> 03:31:19.859 align:start position:0%
not we're going to do the Box Culvert or
 
03:31:23.450 --> 03:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
right the spaghetti room right
 
03:31:25.070 --> 03:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
um as far as buying the property we need
 
03:31:27.050 --> 03:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
that tends to be a critical path in in
 
03:31:29.330 --> 03:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
doing things so we bought the property
 
03:31:32.030 --> 03:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
that we had needed to uh advertise and
 
03:31:35.150 --> 03:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
construct the first the first contract
 
03:31:37.429 --> 03:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
um we are presently by you know working
 
03:31:40.010 --> 03:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
on acquiring the property that we need
 
03:31:43.849 --> 03:31:43.859 align:start position:0%
to um to build and advertise for
 
03:31:46.130 --> 03:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
construction The second contract which
 
03:31:49.130 --> 03:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
would go um you know up to Route 28
 
03:31:52.309 --> 03:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
Route 28 Bypass so that's in your budget
 
03:31:54.050 --> 03:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
right now it is in our budget it's in
 
03:31:56.150 --> 03:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
our Capital program yep thank you yep
 
03:31:57.889 --> 03:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
and it's been it's being very actively
 
03:31:59.510 --> 03:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
worked on
 
03:32:01.550 --> 03:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
um yeah the delays and the and then and
 
03:32:03.650 --> 03:32:03.660 align:start position:0%
the need to get it done
 
03:32:05.510 --> 03:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
um as soon as possible
 
03:32:07.130 --> 03:32:07.140 align:start position:0%
um has been part of the discussion with
 
03:32:09.050 --> 03:32:09.060 align:start position:0%
the with the with the Box Culvert Our
 
03:32:11.389 --> 03:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
concern has been that in in the town of
 
03:32:13.250 --> 03:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
dairy is concerned that is we take a
 
03:32:15.170 --> 03:32:15.180 align:start position:0%
step back with a
 
03:32:17.510 --> 03:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
um different alternative at this at this
 
03:32:17.520 --> 03:32:18.710 align:start position:0%
um different alternative at this at this
point

03:32:18.710 --> 03:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:32:20.330 --> 03:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
um it could delay
 
03:32:23.450 --> 03:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
um getting that project advertised
 
03:32:25.790 --> 03:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
you're welcome yeah thank you I want to
 
03:32:28.010 --> 03:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
follow up with representative Heath
 
03:32:29.630 --> 03:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
um you know I understand Turnpike funds
 
03:32:32.210 --> 03:32:32.220 align:start position:0%
stay with the turnpike but perhaps arpa
 
03:32:35.510 --> 03:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
funds what can go into the turnpike what
 
03:32:40.849 --> 03:32:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:40.859 --> 03:32:43.010 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:32:43.010 --> 03:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:45.769 --> 03:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
I I don't believe there are
 
03:32:48.349 --> 03:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
um any real restrictions on that um
 
03:32:49.429 --> 03:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:32:49.439 --> 03:32:50.090 align:start position:0%
there are
um

03:32:50.090 --> 03:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:52.070 --> 03:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
the one restrictions that do come with
 
03:32:53.389 --> 03:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
the if
 
03:32:56.090 --> 03:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
um is is it can federalize the thing so
 
03:32:57.889 --> 03:32:57.899 align:start position:0%
if we take federal funds for example so
 
03:32:59.750 --> 03:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
federal funds can be used on on the
 
03:33:01.070 --> 03:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
turnpike system
 
03:33:01.080 --> 03:33:02.450 align:start position:0%
turnpike system
but

03:33:02.450 --> 03:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:33:05.450 --> 03:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
um if you do put federal funds into the
 
03:33:07.190 --> 03:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
turnpike system depending what section
 
03:33:09.110 --> 03:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
is that that then
 
03:33:11.990 --> 03:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
kind of federalizes that that
 
03:33:14.929 --> 03:33:14.939 align:start position:0%
um that section and
 
03:33:17.210 --> 03:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
um May potentially have less discretion
 
03:33:19.429 --> 03:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
on what we can do to operate that an
 
03:33:23.870 --> 03:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:27.050 --> 03:33:27.060 align:start position:0%
the um the airport Access Road for
 
03:33:29.150 --> 03:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
example right there at exit I have to
 
03:33:30.889 --> 03:33:30.899 align:start position:0%
get the number but um
 
03:33:34.790 --> 03:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
13 exit 13 which is the the road to the
 
03:33:37.370 --> 03:33:37.380 align:start position:0%
airport a lot of that infrastructure in
 
03:33:39.349 --> 03:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
and around there was was built with with
 
03:33:42.469 --> 03:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
federal funds when the question came up
 
03:33:45.229 --> 03:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
about moving the Bedford toll plaza
 
03:33:47.570 --> 03:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
maybe if it goes a t moving it further
 
03:33:50.590 --> 03:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
south towards Merrimack or or Nashua
 
03:33:52.849 --> 03:33:52.859 align:start position:0%
there are no plans to do that it was
 
03:33:54.410 --> 03:33:54.420 align:start position:0%
just a question that was asked some time
 
03:33:56.630 --> 03:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
ago one of the things that we ran into
 
03:33:58.969 --> 03:33:58.979 align:start position:0%
was because we used federal funds on
 
03:34:00.889 --> 03:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
that portion of the of the turnpike we
 
03:34:03.410 --> 03:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
did not have the latitude of of
 
03:34:08.929 --> 03:34:08.939 align:start position:0%
um of uh moving the toll plaza and and
 
03:34:08.939 --> 03:34:09.650 align:start position:0%
um of uh moving the toll plaza and and
um

03:34:09.650 --> 03:34:09.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:12.469 --> 03:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
you know tolling a section of of
 
03:34:15.530 --> 03:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
road that uh federal funds were used on
 
03:34:18.170 --> 03:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
so that that has been our historic
 
03:34:20.030 --> 03:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
restriction on using federal funds on
 
03:34:22.370 --> 03:34:22.380 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system is that it comes
 
03:34:26.929 --> 03:34:26.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:29.750 --> 03:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
since you brought up the the airport
 
03:34:32.690 --> 03:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
um who this decided
 
03:34:35.030 --> 03:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
the best way to get from you know point
 
03:34:37.130 --> 03:34:37.140 align:start position:0%
a to the airport I mean you go off Brown
 
03:34:38.330 --> 03:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
and you take a left and you're like
 
03:34:40.610 --> 03:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
there and one time I followed the signs
 
03:34:42.290 --> 03:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
to the airport from you know the highway
 
03:34:44.990 --> 03:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
signs and I was like 30 minutes longer
 
03:34:46.610 --> 03:34:46.620 align:start position:0%
to go all the way around and back and
 
03:34:49.070 --> 03:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
you talk about spaghetti
 
03:34:51.469 --> 03:34:51.479 align:start position:0%
um who where did that design come from
 
03:34:53.750 --> 03:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
and did you take away the you know did
 
03:34:55.010 --> 03:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
you take away the information about
 
03:34:56.750 --> 03:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
getting off at Brown and just taking a
 
03:34:57.889 --> 03:34:57.899 align:start position:0%
left and going right into the airport
 
03:35:00.170 --> 03:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
because of potential congestion as the
 
03:35:02.990 --> 03:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
airport increases
 
03:35:03.000 --> 03:35:07.450 align:start position:0%
airport increases
foreign

03:35:07.450 --> 03:35:07.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:10.250 --> 03:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
that was a long that was a long project
 
03:35:13.910 --> 03:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh decades ago they got that done had
 
03:35:16.490 --> 03:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
many Alternatives but the primary reason
 
03:35:19.190 --> 03:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
was uh for the way it's routed now was
 
03:35:22.269 --> 03:35:22.279 align:start position:0%
to relieve um Brown ad for the traffic
 
03:35:25.250 --> 03:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
and the growth of the Manchester Airport
 
03:35:27.849 --> 03:35:27.859 align:start position:0%
at that time particularly
 
03:35:31.130 --> 03:35:31.140 align:start position:0%
some of us remember about eight years
 
03:35:35.510 --> 03:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
ago when the turnpike was doing well and
 
03:35:37.490 --> 03:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
they spent eight million dollars or
 
03:35:41.090 --> 03:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
something like that to the dot to buy
 
03:35:42.950 --> 03:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
the last piece of road
 
03:35:46.309 --> 03:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
to get to Maine you went from the
 
03:35:48.370 --> 03:35:48.380 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts border and it stopped
 
03:35:51.050 --> 03:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
somewhere before it got to the main
 
03:35:53.210 --> 03:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
border and so they bought that last
 
03:35:55.250 --> 03:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
eight miles of Road
 
03:35:58.429 --> 03:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
for about I don't know 20 million 30
 
03:36:01.130 --> 03:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
million dollars something like that and
 
03:36:03.410 --> 03:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
uh you know it was a way to transfer
 
03:36:04.670 --> 03:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
more than that I think it was like a
 
03:36:06.889 --> 03:36:06.899 align:start position:0%
hundred and something I think it went on
 
03:36:08.990 --> 03:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
for three or four years the money was
 
03:36:10.729 --> 03:36:10.739 align:start position:0%
transferred over three or four but that
 
03:36:13.130 --> 03:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
was a way to to transfer money from
 
03:36:14.929 --> 03:36:14.939 align:start position:0%
Turnpike to
 
03:36:16.790 --> 03:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
to Highway fun
 
03:36:19.490 --> 03:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
but you run out of those options of
 
03:36:21.349 --> 03:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
doing things like that made sense
 
03:36:22.729 --> 03:36:22.739 align:start position:0%
because it was
 
03:36:24.590 --> 03:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
straight it was it was the whole way
 
03:36:26.450 --> 03:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
across the state so
 
03:36:29.809 --> 03:36:29.819 align:start position:0%
yeah and that was um I I know
 
03:36:31.729 --> 03:36:31.739 align:start position:0%
when that was set up it was intended to
 
03:36:34.910 --> 03:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
be a longer term Revenue stream of
 
03:36:38.750 --> 03:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
10 10 to 15 years and
 
03:36:41.210 --> 03:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
again to balance the highway fund it got
 
03:36:44.269 --> 03:36:44.279 align:start position:0%
it got it got paid out much much quicker
 
03:36:46.729 --> 03:36:46.739 align:start position:0%
it's reflected in that chart I had
 
03:36:49.070 --> 03:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
pointed and I think it's still your your
 
03:36:51.349 --> 03:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
most profitable
 
03:36:54.650 --> 03:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
Turnpike it takes even though it's not
 
03:36:56.510 --> 03:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
the most mileage it brings in more money
 
03:36:58.250 --> 03:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
than the other oh yes yeah the Hampton
 
03:37:05.510 --> 03:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:07.790 --> 03:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to just close uh if
 
03:37:09.650 --> 03:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
we'll come back and go line by line any
 
03:37:11.929 --> 03:37:11.939 align:start position:0%
any very any specific detailed questions
 
03:37:13.250 --> 03:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to leave you with the
 
03:37:14.990 --> 03:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
impression that we aren't
 
03:37:17.210 --> 03:37:17.220 align:start position:0%
um satisfied with the with the budget
 
03:37:17.220 --> 03:37:18.469 align:start position:0%
um satisfied with the with the budget
um

03:37:18.469 --> 03:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:20.330 --> 03:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
we certainly are
 
03:37:23.750 --> 03:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
um most all of the um
 
03:37:25.010 --> 03:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
um programs and things we didn't
 
03:37:26.750 --> 03:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
experience any Cuts thing things were
 
03:37:28.030 --> 03:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
covered we had some identified
 
03:37:30.349 --> 03:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
additional needs
 
03:37:33.469 --> 03:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
um that that we pointed out but but you
 
03:37:35.990 --> 03:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
know we can live with this budget with
 
03:37:37.429 --> 03:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
the realization that if there are
 
03:37:39.229 --> 03:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
inflationary impacts and things like
 
03:37:41.030 --> 03:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
that you know we will be back to fiscal
 
03:37:42.950 --> 03:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
and others to
 
03:37:42.960 --> 03:37:43.729 align:start position:0%
and others to
um

03:37:43.729 --> 03:37:43.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:46.070 --> 03:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
um to to address them
 
03:37:46.080 --> 03:37:48.469 align:start position:0%
um to to address them
um

03:37:48.469 --> 03:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:50.389 --> 03:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
so with that I did that that's what I
 
03:37:52.429 --> 03:37:52.439 align:start position:0%

the budget and uh look forward to
 
03:37:57.830 --> 03:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
