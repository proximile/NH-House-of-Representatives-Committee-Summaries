00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
myself for a motion I would like to move

ought to pass is there a
 
00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:44.319 align:start position:0%

Grant and I'm going to move Amendment
 
00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:47.990 align:start position:0%
Grant and I'm going to move Amendment
20250

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
20250
 
00:15:50.829 --> 00:15:50.839 align:start position:0%
917h is there a second to
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
that representative Aaron seconds
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
it got it okay okay so briefly this bill
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
this is going to replace the entire bill
 
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
I think this language is a lot cleaner
 
00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:04.839 align:start position:0%
um and gets the point across of what um
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
what the bill was seeking to do I think
 
00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:09.079 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely inappropriate that a
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
municipality can regulate who lives in
 
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
what bedroom and how they're related um
 
00:16:15.069 --> 00:16:15.079 align:start position:0%
so all this would do is update the
 
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
commission for human rights statute
 
00:16:18.509 --> 00:16:18.519 align:start position:0%
Equal Housing Opportunity by adding on
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
line 13 cities towns and municipalities
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
shall not mandate that occupants of
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
housing units be related by blood or
 
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
marriage this does not prohibit a town
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
enforcing a fire code this does not
 
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
prohibit um local boarding houses I
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
think this is much cleaner language um
 
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
and I think it gets the point across of
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
what the bill is trying to do um other
 
00:16:41.069 --> 00:16:41.079 align:start position:0%
other comments on this representative
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
Howland so does that mean that the
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
municipality still allows a change of
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
use I believe so as long as they're not
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
discriminating based on blood or
 
00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:53.150 align:start position:0%
discriminating based on blood or
marriage

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
okay okay any other discussion is a show
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
a hand oh representative Reed I just
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to say thank you for the amend I
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
really like it I think it does very
 
00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
elegantly get to the point Thank you Mr
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
chair you're welcome represent pal I
 
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
don't know whether it's the right time
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
to say this but I passed out another one
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
which was an amendment that I crafted I
 
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:13.720 align:start position:0%
think the real issue with the lodging
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
houses is the the stat itself is super
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
vague and that's why no one wants to do
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
it um there's no unlike anywhere else in
 
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh F any anywhere
 
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
else uh per occupant square footage is
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
defined so for example an apartment it's
 
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
200 square ft per occupant the amendment
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
that I just did took from other states
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
what they do for lodging houses that
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
really defines the actual square footage
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
in that case so it's 80 square foot per
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
occupant per bedroom and 60 per occupant
 
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
per bedroom if they're shared I kept in
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
there that you could not do uh
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination by familiar non-familiar
 
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
relationship or marital status and then
 
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the paragraph uh I talked
 
00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
to OS and was going to reference RSA 153
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
which is state State Fire code they said
 
00:18:02.909 --> 00:18:02.919 align:start position:0%
instead why don't you put the actual
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
Statute in State Fire code that's there
 
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
so the definition at the bottom that
 
00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
you're seeing for lodging houses is an
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
NFPA 101 which state fire code
 
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
references and so this just makes it so
 
00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:17.799 align:start position:0%
much easier for a municipality if
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
they're going to say we want to have a
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
lodging house you can say well this is
 
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
exactly how many are in it so your code
 
00:18:26.149 --> 00:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement can actually do this so
 
00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
that's that's why I would like to
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
introduce so will um call a vote on my
 
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment first um and then I'll give
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
you the opportunity to offer yours if
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
you'd like to thank you okay represent
 
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
Paige thank you Mr chair um I just want
 
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
to say that I appreciate the creative
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
approach of this amendment I think it
 
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
comes at it from a different angle but
 
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
solves the Crux of the problem um when
 
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
we get to if we talk about Al's
 
00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment I'll say I also support that
 
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
approach but if you know seeing the
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
writing on the wall today I'm supportive
 
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
of of the amendment that's being offered
 
00:18:59.789 --> 00:18:59.799 align:start position:0%
right now I think that it leaves some of
 
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
these other issues
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
unresolved but I think we can deal with
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
them down the road and it sounds like
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
there's another bill in in mun that
 
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
tackles some of the same issues so I
 
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
think there there's some work left
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
unfinished if we take just this
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
amendment but I support I support us
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
pursuing this amendment okay so this
 
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
amendment if adopted would completely
 
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
replace the bill so if your amendment is
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
adopted it would replace my Amendment
 
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
just see no no point of order uh a
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
committee can adopt two different you're
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
thinking of the floor with floor
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
amendments a committee can adopt two
 
00:19:34.149 --> 00:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
amendments and then s has to merge them
 
00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:35.559 align:start position:0%
into one amendment that would be a
 
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
really crazy amendment that would be a
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
crazy Amendment and I I do not I think
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
that representative Allen has done
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
fantastic work I think it's a little bit
 
00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
complex for where we are in this in this
 
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
stage in the game and so I like the
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
Simplicity of the chair's
 
00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:52.039 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay so is a show of hands
 
00:19:53.149 --> 00:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
okay on this amendment or you want a
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
roll call all right all those in favor
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
of amendment number 0 917h raise your
 
00:19:59.549 --> 00:19:59.559 align:start position:0%
hand now
 
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
those opposed all right motion carries
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
um 16
 
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
to1 well this is just adopting an
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
amendment um now we're on the motion of
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
ought to pass representative Howland do
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
recognized to move an amendment uh so I
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
move uh uh Amendment uh 0985 H which
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
amends uh House Bill 5 uh 57 as I said I
 
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
already went over everything in the bill
 
00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:26.679 align:start position:0%
I think it just clarifies the lodging
 
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
house statute and whether we do it this
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
time time or next time I know that we
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
need to clarify it because there's
 
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
problems with it thank you and I'll
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
second that so that you can offer the
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
amendment but I'm not going to support

0979 which is before everybody on your
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
desk okay second by representative
 
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
boo okay would you like to speak to the
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
work of the subcommittee and I would
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
like to speak to the work of the
 
00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and to the amendment um I
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
will try to be very brief so we heard a
 
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
lot of feedback during the hearing this
 
00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
is the bill that creates this thing
 
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
called an extraordinary restriction on
 
00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
housing and it says yeah your their town
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
can do the extraordinary restriction but
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
there's a higher threshold if they do
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
that representative Buller um pointed
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
out that um strict scrutiny is a legal
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
standard that very elegantly brings up
 
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
that level to say you have to have all
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
your ducks in a row to prove that this
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
is um is in order and in necessary so we
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
took out the you have to bring up you
 
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
know this scientific understanding and
 
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
quantitative and and whatever evidence
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
and we just brought it to that strict
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
scrutiny level which is in case law um
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
the wording is narrowly tailored to
 
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
serve a compelling government interest
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
and we made it even more specific narrow
 
00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
compelling government interest in public
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
health or safety specifically so it's a
 
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
very high standard that the courts would
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
have to use to say that that is
 
00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate um so we took out all that
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
evidence we did say you can supply the
 
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
evidence in paragraph two but that it's
 
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
not dispositive and then number three is
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
the list all of the items are largely
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
the same we did take out the camping
 
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
ones which really hurt my feelings but
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
um I want to camp on my own land but we
 
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
took it out as something that a lot of
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
people would find fault with and uh
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
particularly the Senate we also took out
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
the kind of income based thing that
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
would say that if you're getting a a
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
variance you wouldn't be charged more
 
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.190 align:start position:0%
variance you wouldn't be charged more
than

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:24:28.389 --> 00:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
$100 um so the ones that remain are the
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
largely what we talked about uh minimum
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
square foot which allows tiny homes
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
unless they can prove otherwise um lot
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
size minimums of five gross Acres gross
 
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
being important because there may be
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
Wetlands um per primary dwelling unit so
 
00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
the way I had it before was per lot but
 
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
then you would have like if you had adus
 
00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
then they could require with one Adu a
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
10 acre minimum for example so we said
 
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
per primary dwelling unit uh we added ro
 
00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
road Frontage requirement which was
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
similar to a previous Bill we passed um
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
the prohibition on residential use in
 
00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:04.039 align:start position:0%
areas zone for commercial use which is
 
00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
similar to a bill that we passed
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
restriction on inhome business use and
 
00:25:08.669 --> 00:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
area zone for residential use provided
 
00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
that such business does not violate
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
noise pollution garbage or light
 
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
ordinances uh whether a dwelling is
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
constructed on or offsite which allows
 
00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
for manufactured um quanz it Mo um all
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
kinds of different kinds of homes um and
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
local amendments to State Building Codes
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
so the State Building code's always in
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
effect but if it's a 4unit or smaller
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
the town can't add to the State Building
 
00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
Code with respect to building materials
 
00:25:36.389 --> 00:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
or methods of construction this is where
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
you get your 3D printed houses Etc and
 
00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
then the effective date is the last
 
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
piece originally well second to last
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
piece um so we're saying the current
 
00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
ordinances that would that are already
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
in place that would violate this they
 
00:25:54.029 --> 00:25:54.039 align:start position:0%
would have um well the effective date
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
they won't be able to enforce it unless
 
00:25:58.269 --> 00:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
those ordinances meet that requirement
 
00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
so that immediately makes those
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
ordinances like open to lawsuit by the
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
the citizens who are impacted and then
 
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
the final thing is the effective date
 
00:26:07.389 --> 00:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
which is 180 days we originally had 60
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
days which is pretty standard and I had
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
given an extra 90 days for uh current
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
ordinances but since we're removing that
 
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
90 days from that section I just talked
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
about we're extending to 180 days to
 
00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
give them time to go back and revise any
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
current ordinances they have and there
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
you go right other comments represent
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
buo representative Aaron yes I was on
 
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee uh the original bill I
 
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
could not support I think the
 
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of the
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee did a great job in in
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
cutting down everything to this level of
 
00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh wording and I can support this
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
represent buo yes um so I I also
 
00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate a lot of the work that was
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
done um you know in in the subcommittee
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
on a bipartisan basis I think
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative Reed um did a really good
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
good job of summarizing um the bill and
 
00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
how uh this amendment and how things
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
have changed the only other thing I
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
would want to emphasize is that if you
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
look at the language of this bill it
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
says town this this bill I think seeks
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
to strike a balance and it gives a lot
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
of difference to local control it's not
 
00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
saying towns can't do these things it's
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
saying towns may do these things they
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
just have to you know have a their
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
restriction narrowly tailored to serve a
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
compelling government interest and that
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
interest is in public health or safety
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
which is reflective of the language um
 
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
in the Z enabling act um the other thing
 
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
I would point out is that we did kind of
 
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
leave a little breadcrumb here in terms
 
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
of the type of evidence that may be used
 
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
to show that such as scientific studies
 
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
quantitative or empirical evidence um
 
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
but they those things are not
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily dispositive of whether
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
something is actually um narrowly
 
00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
tailored or not it's just saying that's
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
something that may be offered but it is
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
not inherently dispositive
 
00:27:58.509 --> 00:27:58.519 align:start position:0%
so um I like this especially I've just
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
realized on um
 
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:03.559 align:start position:0%
line um 29 the Restriction inh home
 
00:28:06.269 --> 00:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
businesses um used for residential use
 
00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
that means EFA families can use their
 
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
efas in an a residential setting with
 
00:28:13.509 --> 00:28:13.519 align:start position:0%
restriction you may not remember this Mr
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
chair but two years ago a year ago
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
whatever it was you said emphatically to
 
00:28:21.389 --> 00:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
me as a member on the special committee
 
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
on housing you want people to have cafes
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
in their homes and walkable little cute
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
little neighborhoods and and that is
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
exactly why I put that in the LSR when I
 
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
filed it was because of your
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
recommendation Mr chair may I add to a
 
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
comment of rep represent Boyers um just
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
that uh the subcommittee of the
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee was me bringing in lawyers
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
from mercus and Institute of justice so
 
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
we had like I think four lawyers working
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
on this including representative bolier
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
and um so the the findings effect if
 
00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
anybody is confused about dispositive
 
00:28:54.669 --> 00:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
all it means is that just because they
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
supplied an Evidence doesn't mean that
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
that proves the case the judge still
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
determines whether or not it's um
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely compelling to the government
 
00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:04.519 align:start position:0%
interest in health and safety that's all
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
okay other comments representative Hicks
 
00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you one of the one of the things I
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
think that we struggle with on this
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
committee a little bit is that balance
 
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
of um State mandate versus local control
 
00:29:15.789 --> 00:29:15.799 align:start position:0%
and I think this um bill is a good
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
example of of that and really weighing
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
um those two pretty conflicting you know
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
issues uh and I think that this bill
 
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
does do a good job with that I also
 
00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh representative Reed's
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
feelings even though they were hurt she
 
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
understood in ordered the bigger picture
 
00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:36.919 align:start position:0%
here and getting this path to help
 
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
people build housing in the state and be
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
housed in this state um so it was good
 
00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
compromise it was good bipartisan work
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
and I think this is more of what should
 
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
be happening in the house so thank you
 
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:49.720 align:start position:0%

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
