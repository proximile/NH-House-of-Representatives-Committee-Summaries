Mr chair and thank you honorable members
 
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 align:start position:0%
is Ellen Reed I represent Rockingham 10
 
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
which is New Market and new Fields um
 
00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
this is the third iteration of a bill
 
00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
that just a few months ago this
 
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
committee uh
 
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
unanimously uh passed the uh recommended
 
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
for future legislation determination out
 
00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 align:start position:0%
of interim study I realized that many of
 
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
you are new to the Comm or new to the
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
house in general and so won't have
 
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
remembered that but those of you who are
 
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
here will remember that particular one
 
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 align:start position:0%
because that's the one where we had a
 
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
filmmaker who's doing a documentary on
 
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
this issue show up um she is not with us
 
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 align:start position:0%
today she is filming somewhere else I
 
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
will say that I've passed out an
 
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that I'll get to the
 
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
differences I am very excited about this
 
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
language because it addresses everything
 
00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 align:start position:0%
that was brought up in the two different
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
hearings and the interim study it also
 
00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 align:start position:0%
um it it IT addresses the opposition in
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
a way that makes it Broad and yet very
 
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
very tailored so um I'm I'm I will get
 
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
to the language specifically uh I'm
 
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
going to tell my story again because
 
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
there are so many new people on the
 
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
committee but this uh was this idea this
 
00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
bill was generated because of my
 
00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
personal story but I didn't think to put
 
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
it in at first until I realized it was a
 
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
lot of people's personal stories um so I
 
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
started getting my period when I was 13
 
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
and since that day it has never been
 
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
regular it has never been normal uh a
 
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
normal period lasts maybe 3 to 5 days uh
 
00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 align:start position:0%
my periods would frequently go 2 to
 
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
three weeks and I would maybe have
 
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
several months in between periods so uh
 
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
so it was a problem my entire life but
 
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
at the age of 28 I was finally diagnosed
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
with PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome um
 
00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
um and I started I had known from a
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
fairly young age that I did not want to
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
have children I grew up the oldest
 
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
sister of four younger brothers and I
 
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
did all my parenting when I was a
 
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
teenager and I was I was quite happy
 
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
with that thank you very much um and I
 
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
married a man who also didn't want to
 
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
have children and and got of visectomy
 
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
so I was begging these doctors total of
 
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
six doctors over the next decade um to
 
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 align:start position:0%
go ahead and just take it out I don't
 
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
need it it's causing me misery um I then
 
00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:06.759 align:start position:0%
bled for a year straight over a year 365
 
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
days plus I bled every single day some
 
00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 align:start position:0%
days were heavy some days were spotting
 
00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:12.759 align:start position:0%
but there was blood every single day for
 
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
over a year and that's when I actually
 
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
ended up getting diagnosed and these
 
00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:18.919 align:start position:0%
doctors tried literally everything
 
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
because every single time I said you
 
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 align:start position:0%
know we can just remove it I'm good with
 
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
that they would say oh no no you're
 
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
gonna want to have kids I'm like nope
 
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm quite certain and they would say
 
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
well what about your husband doesn't
 
00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
your husband wants to have
 
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
kids um didn't know he had a a say over
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
my my medical condition but actually no
 
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
he has a
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
visectomy um and they were like well
 
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
what if you marry someone else that
 
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
person might want to have kids so the
 
00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
reproductive desires of a hypothetical
 
00:07:54.149 --> 00:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
man who doesn't even exist were more
 
00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
important than my literal medical
 
00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
needs um and so this went on I I changed
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
doctors frequently um they tried iuds
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
IUD almost punct punctuated my uh
 
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
perforated my uterus they tried
 
00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
everything nothing would control the
 
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
bleeding and then um at the age of 37 I
 
00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
did something that's I guess kind of
 
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
rare it's called shedding a cast and
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
I've never given birth so I didn't know
 
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
what was happening I thought I was dying
 
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
it was a tremendous pain but it turns
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
out I was having
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
contractions I was having contractions
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
because I was giving birth to a mold of
 
00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
the interior of my uterus um it took
 
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
hours I was on the phone with 911 in
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
tears on the toilet when I caught the
 
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
said mold of my uterus it looked like
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
two small bloody chicken breasts if you
 
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
wanted that level of
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
detail um and then finally after that
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
happened I got a new doctor and that
 
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
doctor finally said well you're 38 and
 
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
you're old enough
 
00:08:59.949 --> 00:08:59.959 align:start position:0%
now what other medical procedure
 
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
do we wait any any age past 18 to say
 
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
that a person is allowed to say what
 
00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.990 align:start position:0%
that a person is allowed to say what
they

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
want so anyway I that that happened in
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
my second term as a legislator and I
 
00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
still didn't realize because I literally
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of women kind of were
 
00:09:19.069 --> 00:09:19.079 align:start position:0%
conditioned like this I thought it was a
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
me problem I thought that I was just
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
getting bad doctors or having a bad run
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
of not being able to advocate for myself
 
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
or what have you and it was just me and
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
then I found an online community of
 
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:37.720 align:start position:0%
women mostly women some men um who have
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
had almost exactly the same issue and
 
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
not just for um PCOS largely for
 
00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:44.959 align:start position:0%
endometriosis these women have suffered
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
far more than I ever did um
 
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0%
pmdd uh uh a wide range of conditions
 
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
cancer and in fact two documented cases
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
I found one in the UK and one in the US
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
where women died of cancer
 
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
because they well you can say because of
 
00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:03.399 align:start position:0%
cancer and we don't know what would have
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
happened but their doctor refused to
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
remove their
 
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
uterus because the doctor thought they
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
could save their life and their
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
fertility and so it's it's it's really
 
00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:20.839 align:start position:0%
kind of crazy making that um it seems to
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
be primarily women that we think of
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
their worth is like in their
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
reproductive abilities and if they don't
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
have reproductive abilties somehow
 
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
they're their life isn't worth living
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
their pain isn't worth hearing um their
 
00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
life isn't worth taking care
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
of and only seems to be women that it's
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
okay for a doctor or whoever to say what
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
they are going to want in their personal
 
00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
lives in terms of how many kids they're
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
going to want like that's not a medical
 
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
thing that is a personal decision
 
00:10:59.069 --> 00:10:59.079 align:start position:0%
thing so the bill um and I'll go through
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
the details of the amendment being
 
00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:01.639 align:start position:0%
different than the bill and how this
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
bill is different from previous
 
00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:04.959 align:start position:0%
iterations but um the bill has always
 
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
been written in a sex neutral way
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
because this has affected uh two men
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
that I've heard of
 
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.509 align:start position:0%
that I've heard of
um

00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:13.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
but it does affect women far more and
 
00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
the problem is cultural and this isn't
 
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
even a New Concept like we know in in
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
days of your doctors were discriminatory
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
based on race or based on what have you
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
and we had to take action to make sure
 
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
that those cultural things didn't seep
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
into the medical care and so this is
 
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
just an extension of
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
that but um it it's really telling
 
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
because when my husband got a visectomy
 
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
he got it not because he had like you
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
know some sort of cancer or condition
 
00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
that he needed the vasectomy for medical
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
reasons he got it CU he wanted it and
 
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
not only did he not experience any push
 
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
back and was asked well you know you're
 
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
too young what does your wife want or
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
what would your future wife want not
 
00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
only did you not get pushed back on
 
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
getting this voluntary vasectomy but it
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
was paid for by the
 
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
government it was paid for by the
 
00:12:07.389 --> 00:12:07.399 align:start position:0%
government the government pays for um
 
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
vasectomies as it turns out but a woman
 
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
who has a debilitating condition and
 
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
mine was the least debilitating of the
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
stories that I know of a debilitating
 
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
condition where they are bleeding they
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
are in pain who needs this treatment and
 
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
a doctor will admit yes this will cure
 
00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
your problem who has it covered by her
 
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
insurance can still not get the
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
treatment because say but you're going
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
to want to have babies even though you
 
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.150 align:start position:0%
to want to have babies even though you
say

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:37.399 align:start position:0%
no so getting to the language um there's
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
only ever been in the two hearings that
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
this has had over the two iterations
 
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
there there's only ever been one person
 
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
that ever showed up in opposition and
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
that was the med uh the Catholic uh
 
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
Hospital who at the time the very first
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
iteration of this bill uh it did not
 
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
limit the medical conditions to 18 and
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
over and so they were worried about 18
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
and under so this bill brought it up to
 
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
18 um the previous iterations of the
 
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
bill had it in the patients Bill of
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
Rights which turns out is more about
 
00:13:10.829 --> 00:13:10.839 align:start position:0%
facilities so um according to the
 
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
feedback I've gotten actually from my
 
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
very very bipartisan this bill has
 
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
always been bipartisan and actually
 
00:13:19.189 --> 00:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
there are more Republican wait there
 
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of Republicans on the
 
00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:22.519 align:start position:0%
bill and there's Republicans on it now
 
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
but um based on that feedback I've moved
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
it out of the patient Bill of Rights um
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:31.720 align:start position:0%
so the first part basically guarantees
 
00:13:33.629 --> 00:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
that if you have a medical condition for
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
which a treatment that happens to leave
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
you sterile or unable to Bear children
 
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
or unable to have children even
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
temporarily that the physician cannot
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
deny the treatment on the basis of age
 
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
the number of children marital status or
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
the physician's speculation of the
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
patient's reproductive intentions
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
contrary to the patient
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
statement so the doctor can't say no I
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
know you said you don't want to have
 
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
kids but I know better than you you you
 
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
grown person in your 30s for
 
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
example um it the doctor can of course
 
00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
always deny for medical reasons if it's
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
not advisable to do the doctor can deny
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
for payment payment reasons the doctor
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
can deny even for religious reasons but
 
00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
just not these kind of condescending
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
patronizing reasons um that have nothing
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
to do with medical situation of the
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
patient and everything to do with
 
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
cultural and sociological uh
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
ideas um the second part which used to
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
be the third part of the bill uh holds
 
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
harmless any physician that Pro provides
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
a sterilizing
 
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
treatment that uh gets a assigned waiver
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
of informed consent from the patient so
 
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:43.160 align:start position:0%
you can still sue them for malpractice
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
they left for steps in you what have you
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
you cannot sue them for making you
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
sterile when that is exactly what you
 
00:14:50.829 --> 00:14:50.839 align:start position:0%
signed that you wanted and just for the
 
00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:52.839 align:start position:0%
record this is what I said to my doctor
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
if I regret this decision every surgery
 
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
has a regret rate every single one if I
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
end up regretting this I'll ad stopped
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
that's fine that's on me give me
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
something to
 
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
sign so the amendment before you is I
 
00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
really like it because it gets really
 
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
really narrow there were questions
 
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
previously like two years ago about well
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
how does this affect trans issues and I
 
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that we weren't
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
conflating these issues the reason I put
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
this in is because so many women
 
00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
thousands of women across the country
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
have experienced the same exact thing
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
like me and the more I talk about it the
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
more wild it is how many women it is
 
00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:31.959 align:start position:0%
because literally I'll be talking to a
 
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
group of five women one of them like oh
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
my God that happened to me so it really
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with trans issues I
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
get very uh narrow with the definition
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
of medical condition here any disease
 
00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
disorder syndrome symptoms genetic
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
predisposition or family medical history
 
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:49.959 align:start position:0%
or the state of being
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
medicated um that either affect the
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
reproductive system or make reproduction
 
00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
not advisable for either the medical
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
interest of the patient or for potential
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
children and then I also include
 
00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
reproductive care before I was very
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
focused on surgery um now it's very
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
narrowly defined as very specific
 
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
surgeries but also medications that
 
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
affect fertility I was unaware but
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
apparently uh there are medications for
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
diseases that if you are a youngish
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
woman a doctor will not give you even if
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
you're suffering from the disease
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
because that medication makes you uh
 
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
unable to have children so
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
um online the support was something
 
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
something like getting close to 300 in
 
00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
favor many of those were very moving
 
00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:35.560 align:start position:0%
stories of women who almost lost their
 
00:16:37.949 --> 00:16:37.959 align:start position:0%
lives um to for in opposition there was
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
no written testimony for the opposition
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
so um it it's really crazy how unspoken
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
this issue is and how widespread it is
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm happy to take questions
 
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
I may have forgotten some of the details
 
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
I wanted to bring up about the language
 
00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to take questions
 
00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
representative Markel yes thank you for
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
uh taking my question
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
um one question ma'am uh as I read this
 
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
statute uh this
 
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.429 align:start position:0%
statute uh this
proposal

00:17:08.429 --> 00:17:08.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
um if your if this proposal requires a
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
physician to treat
 
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
um would this have the effect if
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
assuming there's a procedure which is
 
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
going to render somebody sterile and
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
let's say there's a conflict with the
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
religious belief of
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
um uh a physician who may for example
 
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
have a sincere religious belief that
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing should not take place
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh two so I have a two-part question
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
first can a physician refuse to treat a
 
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
patient okay or prospective patient and
 
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
second what is your view on a First
 
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment challenge to this based on a
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
good faith belief that treating somebody
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
are uh preventing them from having
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
children uh is a violation of their
 
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
first amendment religious beliefs thank
 
00:18:07.149 --> 00:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
you for the question I thought I
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
answered it in my testimony but I didn't
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
go into detail so this is very very
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
specifically and I'm I'm working off the
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
amendment but the underlying bill is
 
00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:17.799 align:start position:0%
almost the same language this this is
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
saying that the physician cannot deny
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
for these specific reasons religion is
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
not on the list so to the extent a a
 
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
physician is currently allowed to deny
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
for religious belief they can still do
 
00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
that because I did not add religion okay
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
to that list now the question becomes so
 
00:18:38.149 --> 00:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
if they like I'm sorry I don't believe
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
in this first of all there is no
 
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
mainstream religion whose Dogma believes
 
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
that sterilization is um immoral or a
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
sin but also it begs the question right
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
if you don't believe that giving
 
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
medically necessary sterilization is
 
00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
within your personal religious beliefs
 
00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
why are you becoming an OBGYN when that
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
is like a major part of the
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
job okay but having said that yes to the
 
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
any extent they are currently able to
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
deny for religious beliefs I don't touch
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs it's literally only
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
they cannot deny for the age of the
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
patient if they're over 18 they cannot
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
deny for the number of children they
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
already have their marital status or the
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
physician speculation on what the person
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
wants to do with their reproduction okay
 
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.029 --> 00:19:32.039 align:start position:0%
representative plaz
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
off thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I don't have
 
00:19:40.149 --> 00:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh at hand do you you
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you define uh what is uh
 
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
medical condition is uh do do I
 
00:19:50.149 --> 00:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
understand that the definition is not in
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
the bill but it is in the amendment
 
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
because I couldn't find those that
 
00:19:59.789 --> 00:19:59.799 align:start position:0%
definition in the original Bill the
 
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
the definition of medical condition
 
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
right it was this is why I really prefer
 
00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0%
so that you just got the amendment
 
00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
that's section three at the bottom so I
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
read it out loud but I'll do it again
 
00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
it's one sentence for the purposes of
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
this section medical condition means any
 
00:20:18.909 --> 00:20:18.919 align:start position:0%
disease disorder syndrome symptoms
 
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
genetic predisposition or family medical
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
history or the state of being medicated
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
that either affect the reproductive
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
system or make reproduction not
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
advisable for either the medical
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
interest of the patient or for potential
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
children so if you're going to
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
genetically pass on a terrible terrible
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
debilitating disease then that would be
 
00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
covered for example um if you're on a
 
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
medication which means that or for
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
example we we focused a lot on
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
reproductive issues PCOS pmdd
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
endometriosis other uh reproductive
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
diseases but one of the people who
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
testified before you before and I there
 
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
was probably over the two years like 10
 
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
different people who testified here
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
including men including men uh
 
00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
Republican members of the house two
 
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
different ones that testified about
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
their inability to get uh voluntary
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
vasectomies but we had so many stories
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
one of those stories and she isn't here
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
today unfortunately was a woman who had
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
endometriosis knew that she didn't want
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
to have kids asked for hysterctomy they
 
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
denied her repeatedly she then developed
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh lupus
 
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
which you really should not have kids
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
when you have Lupus you really shouldn't
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
have kids if you have cancer um it's
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
really really dangerous um she got an
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
unintended pregnancy with lupus very
 
00:21:43.269 --> 00:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
predictably miscarried but in the
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
process is now at the age of 27 will
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
forever be on renal medication because
 
00:21:51.549 --> 00:21:51.559 align:start position:0%
she is in permanent renal failure as a
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
result of getting pregnant while having
 
00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:56.039 align:start position:0%
lupus so that is a example of a
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
condition that's not specifically a
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
reproductive condition
 
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
but you definitely should not get
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
pregnant while you have that condition
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
and if the patient knows that they don't
 
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
want children honor that honor that the
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
doctor's job is to deal with the medical
 
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
well-being of the patient the patient's
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
job is to deal with what they want in
 
00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:16.039 align:start position:0%
life whether or not you want kids is not
 
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
a medical decision so um going back to
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
that yes that's in the definition and
 
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
that makes this a lot uh more tailored
 
00:22:27.149 --> 00:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
than the previous version which was just
 
00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:29.320 align:start position:0%
any medical condition
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
um which could have included a wide
 
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:33.400 align:start position:0%
range of conditions that really we
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
weren't trying to capture in this so
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
this is far more
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
tailored Al representative Weber thank
 
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you thank you for
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question it doesn't sound like
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
this is working particularly well but
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
we'll try anyway um following up on
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
representative palazzo's question uh
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
would you also read for the benefit of
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
those who didn't get a copy the
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
definition of appropriate reproductive
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
care because the sentence you just
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
highlighted plus this second sentence is
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
really the gist of your Amendment so
 
00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful yes uh so I just
 
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
it has two definitions that were not in
 
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
previous itations of this bill medical
 
00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
condition and appropriate reproductive
 
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
care for a medical condition appropriate
 
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:21.640 align:start position:0%
reproductive care for a medical
 
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
condition shall include the following a
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
hysterectomy which is the removal of the
 
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
uterus ectomy which is the removal of
 
00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
ovaries oric ectomy which is removal of
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
the the testicles salpingectomy which is
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
the Fallopian tubes an endometrial
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
ablation which is the removal of the uh
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
interior of the lining um of the uterus
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
which usually means that you'll be
 
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
sterile or any medication that may
 
00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
affect fertility and as I said in my
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
testimony there are medications that
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
make you less able to have children at
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
least while you're on them and yet like
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
I believe malaria is one of the
 
00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
conditions for which there's a treatment
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
that they will give you if you're a man
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
but they will only not give you not
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
because it hurts you as a woman because
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
it but because it'll make it hard for
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
you to get pregnant and if you don't
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
want to get pregnant and you need that
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
medication it should be your right to
 
00:24:11.549 --> 00:24:11.559 align:start position:0%
say you know what I'm fine I don't need
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
that uh please treat the
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
condition could I have followup and and
 
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
as a followup just because we're
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
discussing what was in Prior con um
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
things and is not in this one am I
 
00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
correct in in
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
that all the provisions of Prior
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
iterations which
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
required a physician should they not
 
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
want to do the procedure to refer them
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
to somebody else those have all been
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
removed in this iteration right so the
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
the previous iterations had three parts
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
the first part is if you have a medical
 
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
condition for which a sterilizing
 
00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
procedure is a legitimate treatment the
 
00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
doctor can't deny you on the basis that
 
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
the doctor knows better than you what
 
00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
kids you want the SEC the third part was
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
holding the doctor harmless for doing
 
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
that the second part was if you wanted a
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
voluntary treatment a voluntary
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
sterilization like my husband got paid
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
for by the federal government um that
 
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
the doctor can still deny you but the
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
doctor would have to refer you to
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
another doctor who would do it and
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
accepted your form of of payment that
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
has been removed there is no voluntary
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
sterilization left in the bill it is all
 
00:25:20.039 --> 00:25:21.029 align:start position:0%
sterilization left in the bill it is all
medically

00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
medically
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you anyone else
 
00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.870 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you anyone else
representative

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:28.039 align:start position:0%
Tes uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I agree the
 
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
volume is low on this today um I'm
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
wondering on um Roman numeral 2 line 17
 
00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
uh can you
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
explain um and maybe also for the
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
lawyers in the room uh a patient who has
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
signed an informed consent or a waiver
 
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
um can you distinguish what those would
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
be or would it be helpful to be and or a
 
00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
waiver you are indeed going in to the
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
lawyer side of things it's it is how the
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
lawyers at OS determined to write that
 
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
um so that specific or was not something
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
I specifically requested um my
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
understanding is if you're signing a
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
waiver then you're signing saying that
 
00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
whatever I don't I may not know what's
 
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
going what's happening to me but I'm not
 
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
going to sue you and the informed
 
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
consent is I you have told me what I'm
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
going to experience and I'm consenting
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
to this and in either case whether
 
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
you're giving away your right to sue or
 
00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
you're saying I understand in either
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
case we're protecting the
 
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
doctor anyone
 
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:48.520 align:start position:0%

our Flagship University um and I am uh
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
very much in support of this bill um
 
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
just quickly in terms of my own history
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
after I had my second child I sought to
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
get my tubes tied the doctor asked my
 
00:27:23.789 --> 00:27:23.799 align:start position:0%
husband's permission didn't know why he
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
needed it told him my husband was
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
welcome to have more children just not
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
here um you know so ultimately the
 
00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
doctor after I told him if he didn't do
 
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
the procedure properly I'd be happy to
 
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
take his house and his boat made sure
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
that I was you know fine but for um 10
 
00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
years uh once I turned 45 I started
 
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
asking doctors if I could have a
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
hysterctomy because I was having so many
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
problems with my cycle which I'd had
 
00:27:47.509 --> 00:27:47.519 align:start position:0%
since I was 11 years old and all kinds
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
of supplemental side effects including
 
00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
severe migraines with my cycle that
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
debilitating um it took me 10 years six
 
00:27:58.269 --> 00:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
doctors to get someone to actually
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
listen to me I'm actually two days uh
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
two weeks and two days post having
 
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
hysterectomy um but it's literally taken
 
00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:06.919 align:start position:0%
that many years for me to be able to get
 
00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:10.519 align:start position:0%
to this procedure um after having told
 
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
doctors what my symptoms were and why I
 
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
felt it was a necessary procedure for
 
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
myself so I finally met with the doctor
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
who actually took the time to listen to
 
00:28:21.149 --> 00:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
me ran some tests determined that in
 
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
fact I really did need to have a
 
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
hysterectomy and upon doing the research
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
of looking at my uterus and tissues
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
afterwards determined that there was
 
00:28:31.149 --> 00:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
blood going in places it wasn't intended
 
00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:32.799 align:start position:0%
and I don't need to get graphic with you
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
but the blood was not going through my
 
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
uterus just to be clear it was going
 
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
into other parts of my body that were um
 
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
causing me to have extreme symptoms
 
00:28:43.389 --> 00:28:43.399 align:start position:0%
including low iron levels um and other
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
kinds of things now for 10 years I had
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
been telling doctors I had a problem and
 
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
I needed to have this resolved and for
 
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
10 years I had doctors say oh you're
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
fine it's just part of being a
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
woman male doctors female doctors didn't
 
00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
matter I had one doctor tell me oh well
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
when your body stops producing estrogen
 
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:02.200 align:start position:0%
you stop being a woman I'm really sure
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
that's not how it works um to be clear
 
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
I'm still a woman even though my body's
 
00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:09.919 align:start position:0%
not making estrogen right now um but so
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
I support this legislation I think it's
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
important that we have doctors that
 
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
trust patients I think we need to trust
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
women to know what their bodies need and
 
00:29:19.149 --> 00:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
to allow people if they need a procedure
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
like a hysterectomy to be able to get it
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
without having to go through as many
 
00:29:24.909 --> 00:29:24.919 align:start position:0%
ridiculous Hoops as there are at this
 
00:29:26.909 --> 00:29:26.919 align:start position:0%
point and I'm happy to take questions
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%

this bill um much like Ellen um it's
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same story um I've known
 
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
that uh there's a problem with my cycle
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
since I can never remember since I was
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
12 um told my whole life this is what
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
women go through deal with it blah blah
 
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
blah um my entire life I've known I've
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to have children so I suffered
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
through um and and had two beautiful
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
little girls um after the birth of my
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
second child my husband was offered a
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
vasectomy at age 30 no questions asked
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
um it was something that he wanted the
 
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:44.120 align:start position:0%
doctors were all for it um not an issue
 
00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
around the same time my cycle started to
 
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
get worse and I was pretty sure I had
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
endometriosis I had all the symptoms and
 
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
signs um and when I went to my
 
00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
doctor same thing what if you want to
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
have children uh more children
 
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:00.200 align:start position:0%
and I told them well my husband has a
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
vasectomy that's not going to happen now
 
00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:04.639 align:start position:0%

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
what if you get remarried what if I get
 
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
remarried who cares I'm in pain I am
 
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
suffering there is a week out of every
 
00:31:13.389 --> 00:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
month where I cannot be a mother I
 
00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
cannot work I cannot take care of my
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
house I can even take care of myself um
 
00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559 align:start position:0%
after 5 years of begging at the age of
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
35 when I finally aged out of my Prime
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
fertility I was offered um a hysterctomy
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
um during the hysterctomy they found
 
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
endometriosis uh all throughout my
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
abdomen and um it was a
 
00:31:38.509 --> 00:31:38.519 align:start position:0%
really crappy feeling waking up from
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
surgery knowing that I've had this issue
 
00:31:43.629 --> 00:31:43.639 align:start position:0%
my entire life and it took me begging
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
and pleading for years for them to
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
finally open me up and realize oh you
 
00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
have one of the most debilitating and um
 
00:31:56.669 --> 00:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
painful uh diseases that a woman can
 
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
we really need something to support
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
patients especially women because there
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
are thousands of us that I that have the
 
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
same story it's so sad um when I was
 
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
denied my hyam the first time um much
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
like Ellen and others I went online to
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
look for support and came across the
 
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
same thing um I was denied because what
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
if I wanted to have more children I was
 
00:32:31.389 --> 00:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
denied because of my age I was denied
 
00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah I don't understand
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
how this is legal I don't understand how
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
women are being denied appropriate care
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
for their pain and for their suffering
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
based on an opinion of somebody who
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't even know them um the doctor's
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
job is to take care of their patients to
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
make sure that their quality of life is
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
a good good one um and I really feel
 
00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
that and it's really sad that something
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
like this needs to be put in place
 
00:33:05.519 --> 00:33:07.310 align:start position:0%
like this needs to be put in place
simply

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
simply
 
00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
because doctors have opinions Society
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
has opinions on whether or not women
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
should be pumping out
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
babies thank you you're welcome ask
 
00:33:17.039 --> 00:33:18.190 align:start position:0%
babies thank you you're welcome ask
question

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:33:24.029 --> 00:33:24.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%

00:33:31.149 --> 00:33:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Charlotte
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
Montgomery and I need a
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
hysterctomy I started bleeding
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
uncontrollably at the age of 10 and the
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
pain that I experienced was so terrible
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
that I ended up passing out and even
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
then at the age of 10 I was told I was
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
being dramatic this is normal this is
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
what every girl goes through and just
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
need to get up and get on with my day as
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
time went on I spent a majority of my
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
time during those years on the cold tile
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
of my bathroom flooor ring in agony
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
sobbing unable to get up due to the pain
 
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
I experienced I was later diagnosed with
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
Stage 2 endometriosis and adenomiosis a
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
condition in which the only cure is a
 
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
hysterctomy I went on to search for
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
doctors who would perform this needed
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
medical procedure and I was denied again
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
and again and
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
again I had had doctors mock me I've had
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
doctors laugh in my face and tell me
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
they are happy that I've been denied
 
00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:32.919 align:start position:0%
this and Meanwhile my quality of life
 
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
has plummeted I am no longer able to
 
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
live a normal life I know I am no longer
 
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
able to work a normal job I cannot even
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
lift over 10 pounds otherwise my uterus
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
falls out I have had to be wheelchair
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
out of stores after collapsing in aisles
 
00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
from extreme blood loss and from my
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
uterus falling out which has done so
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
I have been begging doctors to help me
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
for years
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
now and I have bled miscarriage levels
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
of blood every single day for over half
 
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
a year only for a doctor to look me in
 
00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
the eyes and tell me think of your
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
future husband think of your future
 
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
children and they always say this this
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
is a common theme across all the doctors
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
I have encountered they tell me to think
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
of this hypothetical child a child who
 
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
will know not ever exist because I'm
 
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
already infertile they tell me to think
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
of them their lives their lives what
 
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.230 align:start position:0%

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
from me daily as I become sicker and
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
to save my quality of life and yet I am
 
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
denied it I come to you today as a woman
 
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
as a woman who is in debilitating Agony
 
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
On The Daily I come to you as as a woman
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
who has had to beg on my hands and knees
 
00:36:02.309 --> 00:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
on a cold Hospital floor for a doctor to
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
take my pain
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
seriously and I beg you today I beg you
 
00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
to support this bill and I beg you to
 
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
pass it so that women such as myself can
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
finally receive the medical care that we
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
so desperately need thank you thank
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
you any questions yes representative Paz
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
off thank you uh Mr chair and thank you
 
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
for story sorry that you have to go
 
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
through it um my understanding uh this
 
00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
bill if enacted it will affect uh only
 
00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:37.430 align:start position:0%
bill if enacted it will affect uh only
New

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.069 align:start position:0%
New
Hampshire

00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
and uh if I remember correctly some
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
other states might be more open to idea
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
of treatment that um uh might uh have
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
side effect of
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
sterilization so do you know if it's
 
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
easier to get the treatment in other
 
00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
states and if it and if
 
00:37:06.079 --> 00:37:07.710 align:start position:0%
states and if it and if
so

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh what stops
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh for example we know that some uh
 
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana patients in New
 
00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:17.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they shop in other states
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
because it's easier or cheaper uh in in
 
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
this case uh is it possible to do the
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
same and just to go to another state uh
 
00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a great question so
 
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
I've actually lived all across the
 
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
country I've lived in New York I've
 
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:33.640 align:start position:0%
lived in South Carolina I've gone for
 
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
medical care not only in New York and
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
South Carolina but also in Florida I've
 
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
sought it in other states and I'm
 
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
currently seeking in Connecticut even
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
though I'm already living in New York um
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
the thing is doctors all over they have
 
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
the ability to deny even if you need the
 
00:37:52.309 --> 00:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
medical hysterectomy such as myself I
 
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
have gone to doctors all across the
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
country and it is the same thing all
 
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
over I have not been able to receive the
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
care that I need in any of those States
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
so hopefully if this bill does Pass New
 
00:38:08.349 --> 00:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
that anyone
 
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:13.880 align:start position:0%

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:01.880 align:start position:0%

okay well I'm going to assume that the
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
amendment has the same intent because I
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't get the amendment the same
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
intent as the bill which is to allow
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
patients to
 
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
receive U yeah move your mic a little
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
closer representative I hate that when
 
00:39:59.230 --> 00:39:59.240 align:start position:0%
you can't hear people
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
okay I'm apologize that I'm going to
 
00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
assume the amendment has the same
 
00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:06.839 align:start position:0%
purpose as the intent of the bill and
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
that is that you're protecting you're
 
00:40:09.599 --> 00:40:11.069 align:start position:0%
that is that you're protecting you're
protecting

00:40:11.069 --> 00:40:11.079 align:start position:0%
protecting
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
providers uh who are uh will will have
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
proof written proof that what services
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
they provide to a patient were what the
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
patient really wanted and they cannot be
 
00:40:28.109 --> 00:40:28.119 align:start position:0%
held uh liable for permanent
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
sterilization if they do a procedure
 
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
that renders the patient unable to have
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
children which sounds like an open and
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
shut sensible thing to do so that people
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
don't get frightened from doing
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
something that obviously they would give
 
00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of thought to that's a very
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
serious repercussion of surgery but if
 
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
you need the surgery that should be your
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
choice and you shouldn't have to worry
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
that you're going to be le legally
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
liable uh or somebody legally liable
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
upset with you so this just sounds like
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
a really good protection for both the
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
patient and the
 
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
provider okay thank you anyone have any
 
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:16.920 align:start position:0%

Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:44:05.549 --> 00:44:05.559 align:start position:0%
was going to report to the Health and

started and so uh sorry about that and
so

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
um what the original Bill did was said
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
that the quarterly reports would last
 
00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.990 align:start position:0%
that the quarterly reports would last
until

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
until
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
2027 and then end and what the amendment
 
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
says is that uh on line 10 beginning
 
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.000 align:start position:0%

00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:42.839 align:start position:0%
2027 the reports shall be submitted
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
annually which means that we keep a
 
00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
record of what's going on with the
 
00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:50.359 align:start position:0%

okay oh wow okay how's that better yeah
 
01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
I think I nailed it so um I'm the former
 
01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
State regist uh in uh
 
01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:23.559 align:start position:0%
1999 I was given the position and I took
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
my position very seriously and my my
 
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
position itself was basically to oversee
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
the collection of birth death marriage
 
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
divorce and Fetal death records and to
 
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
deonate them to uh individuals and
 
01:03:38.029 --> 01:03:38.039 align:start position:0%
organizations that have a direct and
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
tangible interest in those
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
records and uh for me the um my job was
 
01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:49.160 align:start position:0%
taken very seriously and I became
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
concerned because our department our
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
Bureau was within the uh division of
 
01:03:56.109 --> 01:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services and health and
 
01:03:56.119 --> 01:03:56.870 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services and health and
Human

01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
Human
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
Services and there was an issue uh with
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
dissemination of some data that I
 
01:04:07.029 --> 01:04:07.039 align:start position:0%
thought was outside of um privacy
 
01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
actually it kind of it was basically not
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
compliant with how I picture or how I
 
01:04:17.069 --> 01:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
picture how um the law allowed me to
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
protect the data and I had long
 
01:04:23.069 --> 01:04:23.079 align:start position:0%
discussions with um the New Hampshire
 
01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
City and town clerk Association
 
01:04:27.789 --> 01:04:27.799 align:start position:0%
regarding my and their role in
 
01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
disseminating data and we discussed
 
01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:33.279 align:start position:0%
actually moving to the Secretary of
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
State's office um and in 2005 we put
 
01:04:40.269 --> 01:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
forward legislation to uh move the
 
01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
division of Vital Records Administration
 
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
to um the Secretary of State's office
 
01:04:48.269 --> 01:04:48.279 align:start position:0%
and I worked under uh Bill Gardner and
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
and Dave
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
scanland and when we did that we
 
01:04:55.269 --> 01:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
essentially shut off the data for 2
 
01:04:55.279 --> 01:04:56.150 align:start position:0%
essentially shut off the data for 2
years

01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:04:59.269 --> 01:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
um there was a nightly push of all the
 
01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
records of birth death marriage divorce
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
to Health and Human Services from our
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
servers and when we shut it off I mean I
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
was pleased um I was concerned about how
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
um data was um basically um utilized by
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
many agencies that we had no control
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
over and there was some discussion about
 
01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
how uh we penalized
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
people that might release data and on
 
01:05:32.109 --> 01:05:32.119 align:start position:0%
many occasions I've heard the fact that
 
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
Health Human Services operates under
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
Hippa and Hippa itself is um initially
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
was just a misdemeanor at best uh maybe
 
01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
a financial uh issue as well they
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
tightened up the I guess first offense
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
that you may have to like pay I think
 
01:05:52.269 --> 01:05:52.279 align:start position:0%
20,000 or 50,000 based on the infraction
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
that you release data um whereas in
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
Vital Records we we didn't do Hippa in
 
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
fact um when I was State registar there
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
was no other
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
um you know registration area in the
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
nation that utilized Hippa because we
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
all uh had a penalty of a class B felony
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
so you know I was basically concerned
 
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
that we might have releases of data
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
without our ability to basically put
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
people in
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
jail so I did pursue um bills most
 
01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
recently um a couple years ago and I was
 
01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:36.839 align:start position:0%
after shutting off the sharing of of
 
01:06:39.309 --> 01:06:39.319 align:start position:0%
identifiers from birth death marriage
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
divorce and that bill failed and this
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
bill considering I was mostly concerned
 
01:06:49.269 --> 01:06:49.279 align:start position:0%
I guess with the information regarding
 
01:06:51.789 --> 01:06:51.799 align:start position:0%
the birth mother during birth
 
01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:55.240 align:start position:0%
registration um I felt that at least I
 
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
had a to submit a bill that would uh
 
01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
allow the birth
 
01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
mother the ability to basically shut off
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
the data sharing of her very private
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
information with other agencies to
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
include Health and Human
 
01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
Services and you have a copy of the of
 
01:07:16.829 --> 01:07:16.839 align:start position:0%
the birth worksheet and actually uh
 
01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
Kristen Kennis and our state registar um
 
01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:21.799 align:start position:0%
provided that to me and I I handed it
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
out but some of the information you can
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
see on there um um are such items like
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
other terminations of pregnancy anytime
 
01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
after conception date of last other date
 
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
of last other termination of
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
pregnancy indication from one parent oh
 
01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
um and then there was like alcohol usage
 
01:07:49.109 --> 01:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.269 --> 01:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
goodness let's see if I
 
01:07:53.549 --> 01:07:53.559 align:start position:0%
can oh
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
now I'm not looking for Sy but I had
 
01:07:58.589 --> 01:07:58.599 align:start position:0%
cataract surgery uh yesterday and I
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
surprised myself by I understand what
 
01:08:01.039 --> 01:08:02.750 align:start position:0%
surprised myself by I understand what
that's

01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
like um so even domestic status I mean
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
you know a birth WEA may not like the
 
01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
fact that the fact that she might be
 
01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
like unmarried to follow her to all
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
these a agencies where this data is
 
01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.510 align:start position:0%
these a agencies where this data is
shared

01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
shared
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
um alcohol use during pregnancy
 
01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah a number of other pregnancy
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
outcomes um infections present and or
 
01:08:31.709 --> 01:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
treated during this pregnancy like goria
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
syphilis herpes chamia Hepatitis B C and
 
01:08:38.669 --> 01:08:38.679 align:start position:0%
other and even um information like the
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
attendance name and title uh that means
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
that the physician's name would be
 
01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
shared as well and I'm not certain if he
 
01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate he or she would appreciate
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
that too and
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
then um there was concern that there if
 
01:08:59.910 --> 01:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
this data was shut off that or basically
 
01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:02.759 align:start position:0%
if the birth mother checked a box
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps saying that she does not want
 
01:09:04.799 --> 01:09:05.590 align:start position:0%
perhaps saying that she does not want
this

01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:09:08.669 --> 01:09:08.679 align:start position:0%
data being ident all the know all the
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
identifying information um she wanted
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
that to be shut off when the data gets
 
01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.149 align:start position:0%
that to be shut off when the data gets
re-shared

01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
re-shared
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
um you know I found that important for
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
the birth mother to be able to do that
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
and there are currently the ility for
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
that mother to opt in such
 
01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
as uh Social Security admin
 
01:09:34.829 --> 01:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
Administration uh they have a program
 
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
called enumeration of birth and on the
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
birth worksheet they have a a checkbox
 
01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
saying yes um I'd like for the state to
 
01:09:45.309 --> 01:09:45.319 align:start position:0%
provide the Social Security
 
01:09:47.070 --> 01:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
Administration data from this form
 
01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
issued to the SSA and that would allow
 
01:09:53.709 --> 01:09:53.719 align:start position:0%
um her the ability to do things remotely
 
01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
that otherwise she'd have to go into to
 
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
a social Social Security Administration
 
01:10:00.189 --> 01:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
office and do it you know dragging a
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
baby in toe and so I
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
mean there is a familiarity with
 
01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
checking a box saying I do want to have
 
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
this data going forward or I do not
 
01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.390 align:start position:0%
this data going forward or I do not
um

01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
so that's basically um why I'm going
 
01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
forward with
 
01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
um at least making certain that the
 
01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
birth mother on a birth worksheet would
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
be able to stop data or identifying
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
information to go to the many many
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
agencies that you know this data is
 
01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.709 align:start position:0%
agencies that you know this data is
shared

01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
shared
 
01:10:39.719 --> 01:10:42.750 align:start position:0%
shared
to

01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
um that's pretty much it I'll take
 
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any thank you
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much uh
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my questions uh
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
or my question so just to be sure I'm
 
01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
understanding the workings of the bill
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
clearly all the data is going to be
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
continued to be collected so the data is
 
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
there and resides at vital
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
records and what the bill is ensuring is
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
that when data is shared with the
 
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
Department it's simply done on a
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
deidentified basis is that correct
 
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
correct um
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
and when we say deidentified
 
01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:33.070 align:start position:0%
and when we say deidentified
is

01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:35.719 align:start position:0%
there it it says all personal
 
01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
identifiers shall be redacted so am I
 
01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
right in thinking that's name
 
01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
address yes um well how about how about
 
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
things like age
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
or I'm just trying to find the extent to
 
01:11:54.669 --> 01:11:54.679 align:start position:0%
which the redaction I think I had I had
 
01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
a brief conversation with our state
 
01:11:58.629 --> 01:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
registar earlier and I think we would
 
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
need to probably provide an amendment to
 
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
show exactly which Fields need to be
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
redacted that would be very helpful
 
01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and yeah but um like
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
age would not be redacted I mean there's
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of like uh so it's very helpful to
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
have like age or I mean there's a lot of
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
um individual um pieces of information
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
that would be most helpful for data
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
analysis and followup but
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Lucas and
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
then representative mlan thank you Mr
 
01:12:32.629 --> 01:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
um could you for my benefit and perhaps
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
others listening um follow the
 
01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
completion of this
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
worksheet from when that
 
01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
happens I guess my question
 
01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
is where and when is the worksheet
 
01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
completed well the State regist can also
 
01:12:59.149 --> 01:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm I'm an old State regist she's
 
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
a young state registar so I mean she's
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
more um I guess you know regardless it's
 
01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
completed in the
 
01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
hospital followup follow up and as long
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
as that as this work sheet is in the
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
hospital setting is it subjected to
 
01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
Hippa um the worksheet
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
itself the information on the worksheet
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
I mean it's it's my opinion that that
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
worksheet contains information that um
 
01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
should it be released then it would be
 
01:13:32.669 --> 01:13:32.679 align:start position:0%
subject to a classy felony so it would
 
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
be uh because that's essentially a vital
 
01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:38.990 align:start position:0%
be uh because that's essentially a vital
records

01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
records
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
document um may may I the hospital is um
 
01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
operates under Hippa correct
 
01:13:48.199 --> 01:13:49.950 align:start position:0%
operates under Hippa correct
yes

01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
and what happens when this worksheet
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
leaves the hospital is it still covered
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
under Hippa where um from where it's
 
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
headed next our state regist I can
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
update you for most recent law but it
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
used to be it's probably still is
 
01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
maintained in the
 
01:14:09.629 --> 01:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
hospital the department may be able to
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
answer that also they they'll be
 
01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
testifying soon yeah um one one more
 
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
followup uh when it reaches the
 
01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office um are they
 
01:14:24.629 --> 01:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
hippoc compliant okay no doesn't
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
reaching mean meaning that it's uh
 
01:14:30.629 --> 01:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
basically saved in the software and
 
01:14:32.669 --> 01:14:32.679 align:start position:0%
electronically transmitted to the
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
division Vital Records Administration so
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
are they hippoc compliant no because
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
their their data is protected by a class
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
B felony should you release that which
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
is quite more more significant than a
 
01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.270 align:start position:0%
is quite more more significant than a
hippo

01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:48.280 align:start position:0%
hippo
 
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
violation thank you you're welcome
 
01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.910 align:start position:0%
violation thank you you're welcome
representative

01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and have a
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
couple of questions so um this this is a
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
a pretty comprehensive form
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
um does the the birth mother have to
 
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
fill out all of this you you're talking
 
01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
about questions of how many prior
 
01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
children did she had does she use drugs
 
01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
what was the form of payment all that
 
01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
stuff so like I said it's there's a lot
 
01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:17.550 align:start position:0%
stuff so like I said it's there's a lot
in

01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
here does the birth mother have to
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
answer all of this or can she choose not
 
01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.470 align:start position:0%
answer all of this or can she choose not
to

01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking that question
 
01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
because um a couple years ago I think it
 
01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
was like rep or Senator rosenal
 
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
submitted um a bill that essentially um
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
cleaned up the fact that the form used
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
to have a class B felony should you not
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
provide the answer to the questions
 
01:15:45.629 --> 01:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
we're asking you and that class be
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
felony language got
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
removed and you know so the mother can
 
01:15:54.669 --> 01:15:54.679 align:start position:0%
basically refuse to answer you know any
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
any these questions and therefore um it
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
she won't suffer a classy felony however
 
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
the the hospital um provides all that
 
01:16:08.669 --> 01:16:08.679 align:start position:0%
information as well so all the
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
information that the birth mother thinks
 
01:16:12.669 --> 01:16:12.679 align:start position:0%
she's stopping from being transmitted to
 
01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
the birth worksheet it gets saved in
 
01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:17.030 align:start position:0%
the birth worksheet it gets saved in
Vital

01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
Vital
 
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
Records um even backfilling the
 
01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
information that she didn't want to have
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
go so okay follow
 
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
follow up so so maybe have a couple
 
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
follow-ups based on that answer so if if
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
that's the case and she's choosing not
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
to answer this stuff but it is being
 
01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
collected anyway um would would that not
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
be maybe a more
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate a direction to take the bill
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
because as I understand what this does
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
she already has or she thinks she has
 
01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
the right to opt out but what this is
 
01:16:58.830 --> 01:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
doing is this is separating you know the
 
01:17:02.669 --> 01:17:02.679 align:start position:0%
ability to link the child and the mother
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
together and and so I'm just kind of
 
01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
wondering what what is the in what what
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
is the intent of that versus maybe
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
addressing the other point that you
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
bring up where she thinks she's opting
 
01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
out but really she's not so what are
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on that so if she were to
 
01:17:24.189 --> 01:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
say no do not share my identifi
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
identifiable information and apparently
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
um I would like to work with our state
 
01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
registar to come up with the actual
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
fields that that would mean so once that
 
01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
happens the DHHS or whoever that would
 
01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
be you know receiving this data from
 
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
Vital Records would have all the
 
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
information on the mother on the the
 
01:17:48.910 --> 01:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
baby without the identifiers on you know
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
from the mother or the father so it
 
01:17:56.189 --> 01:17:56.199 align:start position:0%
would be deidentified and
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
th this is very similar to how the data
 
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
in Vital Records gets shared with a
 
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
national Center for Health statistics
 
01:18:06.669 --> 01:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
because that's been going on for decades
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
and we send or vital record sends birth
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
and death data to
 
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
nchs and that birth data is deidentified
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know so they get what they want
 
01:18:19.870 --> 01:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
which is all the statistical information
 
01:18:22.629 --> 01:18:22.639 align:start position:0%
that allows them to do you know research
 
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
and provide um output uh interested you
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
know people to see outcomes of certain
 
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
things without the mother's name or
 
01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.550 align:start position:0%
things without the mother's name or
identifiable

01:18:33.550 --> 01:18:33.560 align:start position:0%
identifiable
 
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
information like I said it's been going
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
on for decades so there are a number of
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
other agencies within CDC that also
 
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
receive data um through the Department
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services and it's
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
unknown how they safeguard that data so
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
you know it's kind of like of a concern
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:18:58.270 --> 01:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
but I don't know if that answers it or
 
01:19:01.149 --> 01:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
offers up more questions or I'm actually
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
going to chew it around in my head for a
 
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
bit thank you very much okay
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative L montin thank you Mr
 
01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:19:13.390 --> 01:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
question um so much of this seems like
 
01:19:15.070 --> 01:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
uh that a lot of the data that's
 
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
collected um should be going to Health
 
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
and Human Services can you explain go
 
01:19:24.910 --> 01:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
back again and explain why uh V record
 
01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
was moved to the Department of State and
 
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
not Health from Health and Human
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
Services this is historic um I arguably
 
01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
there may be more safeguards involved
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
but there was um some releases of data
 
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
that I was aware of that um you know
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
really concerned me and um it was
 
01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.709 align:start position:0%
really concerned me and um it was
probably

01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
less I guess
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
overseen back and less of an open um you
 
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
know Quest it was
 
01:19:58.669 --> 01:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
basically I mean the thing that really
 
01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
kind of like um got me more concerned
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
was the fact that and this is back
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
historically so in 1999 I became the
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
state regist in 2005 I believe is when
 
01:20:13.629 --> 01:20:13.639 align:start position:0%
um RSA
 
01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
5c um
 
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
became the vital records uh statue under
 
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
uh Secretary of State and there was a
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
release a basically a C you know CD
 
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
containing all the the data of birth
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
death and marriage to go to a a
 
01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh researcher and it
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
contained you know the records of my
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
daughter and my son and I'm thinking
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
okay well there were no constraints on
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
this release it was basically you know
 
01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:47.719 align:start position:0%
not under the table but without concern
 
01:20:50.669 --> 01:20:50.679 align:start position:0%
about the privacy of of the people on
 
01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:51.390 align:start position:0%
about the privacy of of the people on
that

01:20:51.390 --> 01:20:51.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
CD so that was probably the one that
 
01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
really kind of sealed it but um you know
 
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
I'm more concerned about the ability of
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
privacy on behalf of a birthmother to
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
keep her her data private or at least
 
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
her you know identifiable so the DHHS
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
would still get the data um it just
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
identifiers representative Paz off thank
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
question uh it was helpful to see what
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
kind of data uh could be
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
concerning uh so first part of question
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
is a racial statistics uh could be
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
concerning that both uh mother and
 
01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:41.800 align:start position:0%
father uh have to provide data about uh
 
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
race and uh certain uh maybe ethnical
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
groups and uh if you could uh
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
explain in general what drives this data
 
01:21:57.550 --> 01:21:57.560 align:start position:0%
collection because maybe some of it is
 
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
federally mandated or some of it is uh
 
01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
for purpose of DHHS statistics and some
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
of it may be needed in hospital for care
 
01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
for mother and baby so what drives this
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
data collection to to your
 
01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge um primarily um the questions
 
01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
that are asked are part of a uh you know
 
01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
National worksheet that uh Most states
 
01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh abide by and again I'll refer to the
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
our recent um State registar uh to
 
01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
describe any changes but there have been
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
questions that we put on the have put on
 
01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
the form that were unique to the
 
01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:43.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um you were talking about race
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
think you know race is like a a
 
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
universal you know question that's asked
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
um I don't you know that would not be
 
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
considered like an
 
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
identifiable in my in my opinion
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
um so that should go with all the other
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
non or deidentified data um there was
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
well what was the it was early hearing
 
01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:10.669 align:start position:0%
well what was the it was early hearing
detection

01:23:10.669 --> 01:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
detection
 
01:23:13.229 --> 01:23:13.239 align:start position:0%
um you know there were there were a
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
couple of um questions that were added
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
to the form that were specific to
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
um you know New Hampshire and there was
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
like an early hearing detection field we
 
01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that U babies were
 
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
tested for their ability to hear before
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
they were
 
01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
discharged and I I I think the last
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
hearing similar on a similar Bill there
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
was a a question or concern that that
 
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
data would not you know go to the
 
01:23:51.870 --> 01:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
DHHS and any form that contains um
 
01:23:53.629 --> 01:23:53.639 align:start position:0%
information that were kind of unique to
 
01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
DHHS and their programs would just be I
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
would assume just still be pushed to uh
 
01:24:06.270 --> 01:24:06.280 align:start position:0%
DHHS similarly as the question for um
 
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
enumeration at
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
Birth I mean if there is an agreement to
 
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
push it we'll push it or they'll push it
 
01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
and again the department will be
 
01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
testifying shortly and the advances
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
those questions
 
01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
also um anyone else representative mlan
 
01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
again just a just a final followup and
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
um because I know that the department is
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
going to be testifying but I won't have
 
01:24:33.149 --> 01:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
a chance to talk to the prime sponsor
 
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
again so um but so the the the bill
 
01:24:42.189 --> 01:24:42.199 align:start position:0%
allows for the fact that I'm
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
notifying um the mother how the
 
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
information is going to be used and the
 
01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
mother has um the option to provide or
 
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
not provide except things like you know
 
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
the the about the child itself because
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
you have to have citizenship and all
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
that stuff so given the fact that
 
01:25:03.149 --> 01:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
they're notified and they have an option
 
01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
to not provide some of the information
 
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
do you have any concerns about the
 
01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
separation again of the the mother from
 
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
the child in terms of being able to
 
01:25:19.149 --> 01:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
provide follow-up
 
01:25:22.590 --> 01:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
care okay the mother and the child will
 
01:25:24.910 --> 01:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
both be like you know
 
01:25:26.229 --> 01:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
provided all the information of the
 
01:25:28.669 --> 01:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
mother and child will be sent to
 
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
DHHS but oh sorry except for the fact of
 
01:25:34.109 --> 01:25:34.119 align:start position:0%
identifiable information and then your
 
01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
question is like so say DHHS indicates
 
01:25:39.189 --> 01:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
that there should be like some followup
 
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
with yes Mr Jer can I just sure try to
 
01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
clarify with it so yes so I think you're
 
01:25:49.229 --> 01:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
on to it so so when it's redacted it I
 
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
think it has an anonymized statistical
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
value um but it ceases to have value you
 
01:26:00.109 --> 01:26:00.119 align:start position:0%
know to provide care in a specific case
 
01:26:03.229 --> 01:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
because everything is all now redacted
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
so um so I'm just saying is there any
 
01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
concern that that might erode some of
 
01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
the delivery of services um and is it
 
01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
necessary given the fact that the mother
 
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
is informed that it's going to be shared
 
01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
and she has the opportunity to opt out
 
01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
of providing a large chunk of the
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
information so I'm presupposing that um
 
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
the the testimony from DHHS will
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
indicate that that is a
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
concern but um the focus on you know
 
01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
this bill is personal
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
privacy so I you know I think um
 
01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
predominantly um you know if
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
there I would imagine that if DHHS were
 
01:26:56.229 --> 01:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
to identify and this is like you know as
 
01:26:58.590 --> 01:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
followup with our state
 
01:27:01.390 --> 01:27:01.400 align:start position:0%
registar to see if there might be some
 
01:27:02.590 --> 01:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
need for
 
01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
exceptions um in a critical medical
 
01:27:09.550 --> 01:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
nature you know I think that could be
 
01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:11.629 align:start position:0%
nature you know I think that could be
worked

01:27:11.629 --> 01:27:11.639 align:start position:0%
worked
 
01:27:13.950 --> 01:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
out okay any last questions
 
01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.149 align:start position:0%
out okay any last questions
representative

01:27:15.149 --> 01:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
tez thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:27:19.709 --> 01:27:19.719 align:start position:0%
taking my question um are you aware of
 
01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:21.719 align:start position:0%
any data breaches that have occurred in
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years of in New Hampshire no
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
I think um Florida you know they had all
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
their birth records um you know hacked
 
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
into uh this past year and I'll go ahead
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
well a follow follow yeah follow up um
 
01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
would your privacy concerns be addressed
 
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
if uh the function moved back to the
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
divisional Public Health Services since
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
that's where it resides in Most states
 
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
if not all so I think the um location of
 
01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
idal Records
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
is relatively unimportant I think my
 
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
concern though is you know should it
 
01:28:04.189 --> 01:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
reside back in DHHS there might be kind
 
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
of an or more of an argument to um be
 
01:28:10.510 --> 01:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
able to tap into MCA or Maternal Child
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
Health um you know not nurses and you
 
01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:17.800 align:start position:0%
know people that that go go train
 
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals and you know capturing data
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
correctly but the the the the issue
 
01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
would still remain that uh the privacy
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
of the S you know of that information
 
01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
should be retained within Vital Records
 
01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
even the vital records was in a
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
different agency so if the birth mother
 
01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
wanted that her name redacted uh her
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
identifiers then that is how it shall
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
be okay so no other questions um thank
 
01:29:00.430 --> 01:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:18.109 --> 01:29:18.119 align:start position:0%
nsha thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:29:20.109 --> 01:29:20.119 align:start position:0%
to the committee and thank you sir for
 
01:29:21.629 --> 01:29:21.639 align:start position:0%
pronouncing my last name you've gotten
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
good at that so my name is Paige B
 
01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
I am a legislator I'm a State Rep from
 
01:29:30.189 --> 01:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
NASA W 4 I am also a Maternal Child
 
01:29:33.229 --> 01:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
health nurse for the last 15 years and I
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
am the nurse who was in the hospital
 
01:29:37.390 --> 01:29:37.400 align:start position:0%
talking to the mom and doing these
 
01:29:40.149 --> 01:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
hearing screens the newborn screening
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
Etc um I I first want to say that um as
 
01:29:47.709 --> 01:29:47.719 align:start position:0%
a nurse I absolutely understand the uh
 
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
the importance of privacy you know any
 
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
healthc care professional has Hippa
 
01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
ingrained in them from day one so that's
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
always a very very big concern um
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I think that this bill is
 
01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
much too vague and holds too many risks
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
of unknowns for us to be sure that we
 
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
will be able to as representative McLean
 
01:30:12.109 --> 01:30:12.119 align:start position:0%
said or I'm sorry I forget who it was
 
01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:15.119 align:start position:0%
but the ability to connect mom and baby
 
01:30:17.390 --> 01:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
um we're really concerned about that
 
01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
given the vagueness of the bill now I
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
would actually like to read a letter um
 
01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
from uh some somebody who is not able to
 
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:30.280 align:start position:0%

you but he is submitting this testimony
 
01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:19.400 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill and I'm going
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
to read in his voice one introduction
 
01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:24.520 align:start position:0%

funding and ensuring that targeted
 
01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
interventions reach the families that
 
01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
need them most while privacy is
 
01:31:52.510 --> 01:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly important this bill
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
undermines essential data sharing
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
practices by providing an opt out that
 
01:31:59.550 --> 01:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
removes personal identifiers from birth
 
01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
worksheet data this legislation
 
01:32:04.189 --> 01:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
jeopardizes the state's ability to
 
01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
fulfill its Public Health obligations
 
01:32:09.109 --> 01:32:09.119 align:start position:0%
and may place especially vulnerable
 
01:32:12.270 --> 01:32:12.280 align:start position:0%
mothers and infants at risk two the
 
01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
importance of birth data and identifiers
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
the maternal mortality review linking
 
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
birth and death records I do have a
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
little more if I can go on uh I'll give
 
01:32:25.310 --> 01:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
you another 15 seconds can wrap it up
 
01:32:27.109 --> 01:32:27.119 align:start position:0%
well there's a lot and you will get it
 
01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
we do have concerns in terms of we can
 
01:32:31.229 --> 01:32:31.239 align:start position:0%
read it you know if you want to just
 
01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
summarize that's what yeah in newborn
 
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
screens and hearing tests identifying
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
disparities one of the biggest concerns
 
01:32:41.109 --> 01:32:41.119 align:start position:0%
is our impact on federal funding and
 
01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
what I would like to bring attention to
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh the committee is really to look at
 
01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note because there's almost
 
01:32:51.709 --> 01:32:51.719 align:start position:0%
two pages of risks that DHHS has
 
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
identified I'm not sure if it's in what
 
01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
you have but it is uh in the bill online
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
so I really that yes yes just to make
 
01:33:04.350 --> 01:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
sure that you take a look at that um and
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
I can end there I'm very happy to take
 
01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
any questions especially if you have
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
questions on how things work in the
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
hospital interacting with moms and baby
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
Etc if not totally fine but uh very open
 
01:33:16.229 --> 01:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
to questions if you have them thank you
 
01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
so much thank you any
 
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative palaz off uh
 
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:33:27.149 --> 01:33:27.159 align:start position:0%
my question so I see that facility
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
worksheet includes some information that
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
I don't see in mother's worksheet so is
 
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
it something that uh mother answered
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
before in the facility or is it is it
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
coming from some other sources uh for
 
01:33:47.550 --> 01:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
example I think some um some information
 
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
that uh we might deduct about abortion
 
01:33:54.510 --> 01:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
so for example cannabis use I
 
01:33:57.790 --> 01:33:57.800 align:start position:0%
in facility worksheet on page six but
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
not on mother's worksheet so where is
 
01:34:04.350 --> 01:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
does this
 
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
information came from the information on
 
01:34:11.109 --> 01:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
abortions I'm sorry could you repeat the
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
question yeah yeah for example I I don't
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
see uh
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
um induced
 
01:34:23.109 --> 01:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
losses uh of pregnancies I see this
 
01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
language on facility worksheet but I
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
don't see it on M's worksheet or for
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
example on page six I
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
see uh if uh penal substance exposure to
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh so and on mother worksheet I
 
01:34:46.270 --> 01:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
see only only a question about alcohol
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
exposure so was it was there some other
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
question yes to mother that is being
 
01:34:56.109 --> 01:34:56.119 align:start position:0%
used by facility or is it from uh some
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
other sources I don't have the
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
worksheets in front of me um I'm not
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
sure if this answers your question but I
 
01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
would like to add that with the birth
 
01:35:08.189 --> 01:35:08.199 align:start position:0%
records the information that not the
 
01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
birth records but the health history
 
01:35:13.629 --> 01:35:13.639 align:start position:0%
that we get there is um it's called
 
01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:16.360 align:start position:0%
gravit and that we get a series of
 
01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
numbers that lets us know how many times
 
01:35:21.390 --> 01:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
has this person been pregnant how many
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
live babies did they have and there are
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
a few numbers there that indicate any um
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
miscarriages and there's another one for
 
01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
abortion so I'm not sure if that's in
 
01:35:32.669 --> 01:35:32.679 align:start position:0%
there but if there's a spot that says
 
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
gravit parid with numbers that is what
 
01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
would be indicated there that's where
 
01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
that information would
 
01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
be representative Lucas if I could
 
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chair on representative
 
01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
pv's question um there are two parts to
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
the worksheet that seem to be one coming
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
information coming directly from the
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
mother and another coming from the
 
01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
facility and I think the question is how
 
01:35:58.910 --> 01:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
is that information reaching the
 
01:36:05.709 --> 01:36:05.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
mother I believe that that's coming from
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
the medical records my understanding on
 
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
say the unit is that there's usually a a
 
01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
secretary or somebody who's filling out
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
part of that information from the
 
01:36:22.189 --> 01:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
medical records and then we also go to
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
the mother and get the rest of the
 
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
information that is needed thank you MH
 
01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
I would like to say I have this is
 
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
personal experience I've never had
 
01:36:33.790 --> 01:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
anybody concerned about that most people
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
are very happy because they want to make
 
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
sure that they're getting the
 
01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
information that they need especially
 
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
from the testing that happens they want
 
01:36:43.950 --> 01:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they can be reached
 
01:36:45.629 --> 01:36:45.639 align:start position:0%
and they want to get a birth certificate
 
01:36:47.430 --> 01:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
and I think as written we're not sure
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
how that would impact
 
01:36:51.189 --> 01:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
pazo thank you Mr Chan thank thank you
 
01:36:56.830 --> 01:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
for indulging my second question so in
 
01:36:59.950 --> 01:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
Ma's worksheet uh many fields have
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
unknown uh uh under it so um in your
 
01:37:07.229 --> 01:37:07.239 align:start position:0%
personal experience getting information
 
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
from mother and we heard that uh certain
 
01:37:13.790 --> 01:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
penalties were removed from ma for not
 
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
providing information so uh do mothers
 
01:37:22.669 --> 01:37:22.679 align:start position:0%
have uh opportunity to refuse provide
 
01:37:24.030 --> 01:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
certain information
 
01:37:27.629 --> 01:37:27.639 align:start position:0%
but provide other information or are
 
01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
they being enticed to provide all
 
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
information available and
 
01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
possible as a nurse I can tell you that
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
maybe one of the friendliest units is a
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
postpartum unit um we're very aware of
 
01:37:43.589 --> 01:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
Mom's recovery her being tired and um
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
you know when we go in there and ask for
 
01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:47.229 align:start position:0%
you know when we go in there and ask for
information

01:37:47.229 --> 01:37:47.239 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:37:50.109 --> 01:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
we're if they say I don't know or I
 
01:37:52.149 --> 01:37:52.159 align:start position:0%
don't want to give that information I
 
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
could not imagine somebody that I've
 
01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
ever worked with trying to entice them
 
01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
or or coer them again I haven't been
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
there for every mom but that would be my
 
01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:05.589 --> 01:38:05.599 align:start position:0%

21 I um appreciated a lot of the
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
questions that have already been asked
 
01:39:31.030 --> 01:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
about the birth worksheet I wanted to
 
01:39:33.229 --> 01:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
just do a little bit of a level set for
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
everybody to try and clarify some of the
 
01:39:37.510 --> 01:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
questions that have been asked already
 
01:39:39.950 --> 01:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
so the birth worksheet is um something
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
that is completed by the Hospital
 
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
Birthing Center or attending providers
 
01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
to collect key birth details as you guys
 
01:39:48.430 --> 01:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
have kind of sused out there are two
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
components to the birth worksheet one is
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
called the mother's worksheet and for
 
01:39:55.629 --> 01:39:55.639 align:start position:0%
any of us um who have had a baby you may
 
01:39:58.390 --> 01:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
be familiar with it I remember um a a
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
person coming in in the hospital when I
 
01:40:03.149 --> 01:40:03.159 align:start position:0%
had children with the green worksheet
 
01:40:05.149 --> 01:40:05.159 align:start position:0%
and saying what's the baby's name going
 
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
to be and what's your name and what do
 
01:40:10.189 --> 01:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
you do for work um so that's one piece
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
where you're very clearly aware of that
 
01:40:15.589 --> 01:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
data is being captured and actually just
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
anecdotally I asked if I could leave the
 
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
hospital without a name for my baby and
 
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
was told that I could and I would just
 
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
need to follow up so that gives you a
 
01:40:26.030 --> 01:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
sense of the flexibility just to the
 
01:40:27.589 --> 01:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
point of you know these are very
 
01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
friendly places where moms are very
 
01:40:31.950 --> 01:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
empowered to make decisions um the
 
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
second part of the birth worksheet is
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
What's called the facility worksheet and
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's the part where there's a lot of
 
01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
additional information about a mom's
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
access to prenatal care a lot of
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
information about the actual delivery
 
01:40:47.550 --> 01:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
and information about the child's health
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
and well-being at Post delivery that is
 
01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
generally information that is gathered
 
01:40:55.149 --> 01:40:55.159 align:start position:0%
from the facility via What's called the
 
01:40:57.550 --> 01:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
electronic health record and that's
 
01:40:59.669 --> 01:40:59.679 align:start position:0%
information that many moms myself
 
01:41:02.510 --> 01:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
included have provided over the course
 
01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:04.679 align:start position:0%
of prenatal care and so you're not
 
01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:06.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily sitting there with your
 
01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
newborn baby saying yes I use tobacco
 
01:41:11.149 --> 01:41:11.159 align:start position:0%
you know some of those other questions
 
01:41:12.750 --> 01:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
this is information that's already
 
01:41:15.310 --> 01:41:15.320 align:start position:0%
gathered under a hippoc covered
 
01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
entity um this information is really
 
01:41:20.669 --> 01:41:20.679 align:start position:0%
important um it's submitted then from
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
the hospital or provider to the
 
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
secretary of State um where you've heard
 
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
about the Privacy protections that
 
01:41:30.510 --> 01:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
they're beholden to and then through a
 
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding those data
 
01:41:34.830 --> 01:41:34.840 align:start position:0%
are then shared with the Department of
 
01:41:37.390 --> 01:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services I want to just
 
01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
highlight for people because again this
 
01:41:41.229 --> 01:41:41.239 align:start position:0%
is a little new to me myself New
 
01:41:43.589 --> 01:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the only state that has
 
01:41:46.109 --> 01:41:46.119 align:start position:0%
this kind of a design and setup for our
 
01:41:48.750 --> 01:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
Vital Records all other states house
 
01:41:52.109 --> 01:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
those records under the health agency um
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
as a good sort of bureaucrat myself and
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
a and a real person who supports privacy
 
01:41:59.070 --> 01:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
and and has that need and desire for
 
01:42:01.589 --> 01:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
myself I can tell you that from a hipper
 
01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
perspective the fewer people that touch
 
01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
and access data that are not necessary
 
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
the safer and more secure it is right so
 
01:42:11.070 --> 01:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
as few people that it passes through the
 
01:42:14.189 --> 01:42:14.199 align:start position:0%
safer and more secure um the purpose
 
01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
behind that total birth worksheet the
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
mother and the facility is to then
 
01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
enable the production of a birth
 
01:42:22.589 --> 01:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
certificate so most of us are probably
 
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
familiar with the birth certificate and
 
01:42:26.589 --> 01:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
if you think about it it's an incredibly
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
important uh piece of identification for
 
01:42:31.870 --> 01:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
children um that's going to be the the
 
01:42:34.470 --> 01:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
main way that they can uh verify their
 
01:42:36.510 --> 01:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
identity it's the way that they can
 
01:42:38.790 --> 01:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
verify who their actual legal parents
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
are and you'll hear from others um in
 
01:42:42.910 --> 01:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
future testimony about how the
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
department uses that for things like
 
01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
connecting child support and child
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
protection and then another big piece of
 
01:42:51.589 --> 01:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
the the value of the birth certificate
 
01:42:53.790 --> 01:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
is that it establishes citizen
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
ship um we understand that this bill is
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
largely intended to protect privacy and
 
01:43:03.990 --> 01:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
um as you've heard both vital records
 
01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Health and Human
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
Services really uh value the importance
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
of privacy and have a number of
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
different Security safeguards in place
 
01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
to protect privacy including which I
 
01:43:19.589 --> 01:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
know has been brought up the fact that
 
01:43:20.830 --> 01:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
01:43:23.709 --> 01:43:23.719 align:start position:0%
Services is a HIPPA covered entity and
 
01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
what that means and I think some people
 
01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
were getting at with their questions is
 
01:43:29.189 --> 01:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
that the department is beholden to the
 
01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
same federal and state standards as that
 
01:43:34.229 --> 01:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
provider who is collecting the data and
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
submitting it as a part of the facility
 
01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
worksheet so we are beholden to those
 
01:43:41.709 --> 01:43:41.719 align:start position:0%
same standards of privacy and
 
01:43:45.149 --> 01:43:45.159 align:start position:0%
security um there's also I wanted to
 
01:43:47.709 --> 01:43:47.719 align:start position:0%
draw people's attention to another bill
 
01:43:51.790 --> 01:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
in session currently called s sp92 and
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
that's actually very much focused on is
 
01:43:55.709 --> 01:43:55.719 align:start position:0%
it okay if I keep going sure you would
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
ask for five minutes and we can give you
 
01:43:59.229 --> 01:43:59.239 align:start position:0%
some we usually allow three minutes a
 
01:44:01.229 --> 01:44:01.239 align:start position:0%
person so okay thank you you can have up
 
01:44:03.709 --> 01:44:03.719 align:start position:0%
to nine if you need it okay thank you um
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
so s sp92 is currently in session and
 
01:44:09.589 --> 01:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
proposes removal of personal identifying
 
01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
information from the birth worksheet
 
01:44:14.910 --> 01:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
prior to submission to the CDC Centers
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
for Disease Control and prevention which
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
operates the national Vital Statistics
 
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
system so there's already a bill
 
01:44:23.550 --> 01:44:23.560 align:start position:0%
underway that would address some privacy
 
01:44:25.229 --> 01:44:25.239 align:start position:0%
concerns with regard to as the data
 
01:44:25.239 --> 01:44:27.189 align:start position:0%
concerns with regard to as the data
shared

01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
shared
 
01:44:30.510 --> 01:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
federally um I wanted to cover some of
 
01:44:32.669 --> 01:44:32.679 align:start position:0%
the major reasons that were opposed to
 
01:44:36.589 --> 01:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
HB 621 and many of the others who are
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
prior testimony has covered that there
 
01:44:39.790 --> 01:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
could be some major unintended
 
01:44:42.189 --> 01:44:42.199 align:start position:0%
consequences related to this
 
01:44:44.589 --> 01:44:44.599 align:start position:0%
legislation um while it's well- intended
 
01:44:47.790 --> 01:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
it would very much harm Public Health um
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
it would impact our ability to do our
 
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
newborn screening program which I'll
 
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
have Courtney speak to in a moment um
 
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
removal so there was a statement said
 
01:44:58.950 --> 01:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
that all information would be shared
 
01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
with the department but this bill
 
01:45:03.589 --> 01:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
specifically would enable the data to be
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
shared without personal identifying
 
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
information which you know to questions
 
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
that were received would absolutely make
 
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
it so that the department cannot do the
 
01:45:16.750 --> 01:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
work that we do to serve individuals um
 
01:45:19.229 --> 01:45:19.239 align:start position:0%
so it would actually not provide all
 
01:45:21.910 --> 01:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
data that is necessary for us to operate
 
01:45:24.510 --> 01:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
public health programs
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
um I do want to draw people's attention
 
01:45:29.070 --> 01:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
information on the impacts of this
 
01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
legislation to um the department in
 
01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
terms of access to Federal funding are
 
01:45:35.910 --> 01:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
articulated in that fiscal note
 
01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:38.639 align:start position:0%
worksheet those are the known impacts
 
01:45:40.390 --> 01:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
that this legislation would have and
 
01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
that it was costed at about $12 million
 
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
annually in federal funding um and
 
01:45:47.709 --> 01:45:47.719 align:start position:0%
there's much broader impact to funding
 
01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
to the state of New Hampshire that would
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
result from this
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
legislation um it's important to not
 
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
that a part of the value of the birth
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
worksheet to the department is actually
 
01:46:00.430 --> 01:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
in helping us to do Fraud and Abuse
 
01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
investigations and the actual impact of
 
01:46:05.589 --> 01:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
funding would would be to all of us as
 
01:46:08.109 --> 01:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so in addition to Federal
 
01:46:10.189 --> 01:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
funding being impacted this would also
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
impact the Department's ability to do
 
01:46:14.109 --> 01:46:14.119 align:start position:0%
our work under state
 
01:46:14.119 --> 01:46:16.310 align:start position:0%
our work under state
law

01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
um let's
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
see so if I have a couple more minutes I
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
do want to delve into a minute and 40
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
seconds 40 seconds um a minute and 40
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
seconds do you want to I would like to
 
01:46:30.629 --> 01:46:30.639 align:start position:0%
just highlight one of these really
 
01:46:32.070 --> 01:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
important programs that would be
 
01:46:34.270 --> 01:46:34.280 align:start position:0%
impacted by not getting personal health
 
01:46:36.669 --> 01:46:36.679 align:start position:0%
or personal identifying information to
 
01:46:36.679 --> 01:46:39.830 align:start position:0%
or personal identifying information to
the

01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:41.709 --> 01:46:41.719 align:start position:0%
department good
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
morning we often see on the highway one
 
01:46:47.070 --> 01:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
death is too many this is a critical
 
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
mission of newborn screening one death
 
01:46:52.030 --> 01:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
or disability from a heritable condition
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
especially caused by incomplete
 
01:46:56.030 --> 01:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
information is one death or disability
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
too many the newborn screening program a
 
01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:01.679 align:start position:0%
vital public health program screens all
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
infants born in New Hampshire unless the
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
family chooses to opt out for 37
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
heritable conditions that might not be
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
apparent at Birth the primary goal of
 
01:47:14.669 --> 01:47:14.679 align:start position:0%
newborn screening is early
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
identification and intervention allowing
 
01:47:19.950 --> 01:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
for timely treatment that can prevent
 
01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
serious health issues developmental
 
01:47:27.149 --> 01:47:27.159 align:start position:0%
or even death if the program does not
 
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
receive the birth mother's information
 
01:47:33.310 --> 01:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
there is no way to know what infants are
 
01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:34.229 align:start position:0%
there is no way to know what infants are
not

01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
screened without the match of the
 
01:47:38.990 --> 01:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
mother's information to the infants
 
01:47:40.910 --> 01:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
information critical Health
 
01:47:43.510 --> 01:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
interventions may be delayed and the
 
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
lives of newborns with heritable
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
conditions would be put at risk the
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
program screens 98% of infants born in
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and follows up on over 500
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
infants annually with approximately 35
 
01:48:00.589 --> 01:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
identified with a her heritable
 
01:48:03.229 --> 01:48:03.239 align:start position:0%
condition each year it is essential that
 
01:48:07.229 --> 01:48:07.239 align:start position:0%
the department receives complete birth
 
01:48:09.189 --> 01:48:09.199 align:start position:0%
data thank
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
you do we have like 20 more seconds to
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
talk about 20 more seconds sure thank
 
01:48:18.109 --> 01:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
you yes thank you so uh DHHS the
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
department and the Secretary of State
 
01:48:23.669 --> 01:48:23.679 align:start position:0%
are also both the state agency um under
 
01:48:26.669 --> 01:48:26.679 align:start position:0%
the state so we use the same doit
 
01:48:28.750 --> 01:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology
 
01:48:31.229 --> 01:48:31.239 align:start position:0%
standard in our infrastructure other
 
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
than that for the Department we work
 
01:48:35.589 --> 01:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
with doit to adopt the National
 
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
Institute Institute of standard and
 
01:48:42.589 --> 01:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
technology which is n ISD 853 standards
 
01:48:45.629 --> 01:48:45.639 align:start position:0%
for security and privacy controls for in
 
01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh for information systems and
 
01:48:49.709 --> 01:48:49.719 align:start position:0%
organizations so other than hipot the
 
01:48:53.229 --> 01:48:53.239 align:start position:0%
department act uh did take does take uh
 
01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
another level of pro of protection in
 
01:48:59.149 --> 01:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
the um privacy and security control the
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
department also implement the data
 
01:49:03.589 --> 01:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
governanc and data management system um
 
01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
approach and also the data stewardship
 
01:49:08.669 --> 01:49:08.679 align:start position:0%
approach for user access control and
 
01:49:12.109 --> 01:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
also review process and other than that
 
01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
in addition each users or each um DHHS
 
01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
state employees will need to take the
 
01:49:21.390 --> 01:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
cyber security and information security
 
01:49:23.229 --> 01:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
annual training as well as monthly
 
01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
training to ensure that they all follow
 
01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
not only the hipop but also uh the
 
01:49:30.669 --> 01:49:30.679 align:start position:0%
National Standard and the state standard
 
01:49:33.149 --> 01:49:33.159 align:start position:0%
to protect the information and privacy
 
01:49:34.990 --> 01:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
so this is a part that I would like to
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
address with the department does take
 
01:49:40.109 --> 01:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
another layer of protection and approach
 
01:49:42.109 --> 01:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
for the privacy and also the record
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
level not only just for the vital
 
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
records but for all the health uh
 
01:49:47.790 --> 01:49:47.800 align:start position:0%
Records that we overseas in the
 
01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
department thank you questions
 
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
representative paza
 
01:49:57.870 --> 01:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh Mr chair and uh thank
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so um you
 
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
show that certain
 
01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
programs could be
 
01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
affected but I think uh sponsors of the
 
01:50:19.149 --> 01:50:19.159 align:start position:0%
bill believe that uh uh some uh non
 
01:50:21.390 --> 01:50:21.400 align:start position:0%
nonidentifiable data will still be
 
01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
provided and maybe it will be enough for
 
01:50:27.070 --> 01:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
at least of some of those programs and
 
01:50:30.149 --> 01:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
also uh similar question about new Bor
 
01:50:30.159 --> 01:50:31.550 align:start position:0%
also uh similar question about new Bor
screening

01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
screening
 
01:50:35.990 --> 01:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
program if ma already can uh if there's
 
01:50:41.430 --> 01:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
already ability to opt out and and uh by
 
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
giving them Second Chance of opt out I
 
01:50:48.270 --> 01:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
don't see how it destroys the program if
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
parents already if some parents already
 
01:50:54.430 --> 01:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
opting out of it and now they I might
 
01:50:57.910 --> 01:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
opt out of sharing uh some
 
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
information maybe percentage will
 
01:51:03.229 --> 01:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
slightly increase but I don't see it as
 
01:51:06.109 --> 01:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
a threat to the whole program because
 
01:51:08.149 --> 01:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
they're already not
 
01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:11.639 align:start position:0%
100% thank you so I'll start by
 
01:51:13.149 --> 01:51:13.159 align:start position:0%
addressing the second point and then
 
01:51:15.550 --> 01:51:15.560 align:start position:0%
I'll go back to the first so um this was
 
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
interesting information to me many of
 
01:51:18.750 --> 01:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
you may have heard about closures of
 
01:51:21.229 --> 01:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
Labor and Delivery units in the state so
 
01:51:23.069 --> 01:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
we have less and less access in certain
 
01:51:25.229 --> 01:51:25.239 align:start position:0%
areas of the state so actually an
 
01:51:27.069 --> 01:51:27.079 align:start position:0%
increasing percent of women are giving
 
01:51:29.870 --> 01:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
birth outside of a hospital facility so
 
01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
part of the followup that the newborn
 
01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
screening program does is with
 
01:51:35.229 --> 01:51:35.239 align:start position:0%
individuals who gave birth not in a
 
01:51:37.870 --> 01:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
hospital facility who may not have opted
 
01:51:39.870 --> 01:51:39.880 align:start position:0%
out of newborn screening but may not
 
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
have been offered newborn screening um I
 
01:51:44.430 --> 01:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
think the percent is somewhere it's
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
actually a little bit shocking I think
 
01:51:48.669 --> 01:51:48.679 align:start position:0%
it's up to 25 to 30% of birds are not
 
01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
had in birthing facilities in the state
 
01:51:54.510 --> 01:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
um so that's part one part two um I had
 
01:51:57.390 --> 01:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh s sp92 which talks about
 
01:51:59.109 --> 01:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
limiting personal identifying
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
information being submitted as part of
 
01:52:04.109 --> 01:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
the CDC data submission and the
 
01:52:05.550 --> 01:52:05.560 align:start position:0%
department feels that that's an
 
01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate level of um you know
 
01:52:11.709 --> 01:52:11.719 align:start position:0%
safeguard for privacy without impacting
 
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
the funding to these different programs
 
01:52:15.870 --> 01:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
and Services I wasn't able to touch on
 
01:52:17.950 --> 01:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
the national Vital Statistics system is
 
01:52:20.589 --> 01:52:20.599 align:start position:0%
a system that's used to actually monitor
 
01:52:22.910 --> 01:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
Trends on uh maternal and child Health
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
in the country and then sets priorities
 
01:52:27.709 --> 01:52:27.719 align:start position:0%
for funding and then more importantly
 
01:52:29.629 --> 01:52:29.639 align:start position:0%
decides where the funding will be
 
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
allocated and so New Hampshire's sort of
 
01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
slice of that pie is informed by the
 
01:52:36.350 --> 01:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
data that's submitted to the National
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
Vital Statistics system and that also
 
01:52:41.629 --> 01:52:41.639 align:start position:0%
helps to even have medical underserved
 
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
shortage designations and designates
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
facilities for higher Medicare um
 
01:52:50.350 --> 01:52:50.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates so again it's very
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
critical that we be able to share that
 
01:52:53.910 --> 01:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
data with
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
CDC thank you follow
 
01:53:01.589 --> 01:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chair uh uh it's uh a
 
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
separate question uh so we heard uh
 
01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
about four different um organizations 30
 
01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
or4 so can you provide the full list of
 
01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
organizations that
 
01:53:19.470 --> 01:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
receive uh this data so we heard that in
 
01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire division of Vital Records
 
01:53:25.709 --> 01:53:25.719 align:start position:0%
originally receives it and then it goes
 
01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
to Department of Health of Human
 
01:53:30.589 --> 01:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
Services we also heard from you that it
 
01:53:33.390 --> 01:53:33.400 align:start position:0%
goes federally to CDC and I don't know
 
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
if National Center of health statistics
 
01:53:39.470 --> 01:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
is the same organization or not uh does
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
it go anywhere else and could you give
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
the full list sure um so I maybe uh
 
01:53:48.669 --> 01:53:48.679 align:start position:0%
secretary of state would have a more
 
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
inclusive list but I know um and
 
01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:52.719 align:start position:0%
actually jawe you may be able to speak
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
to I it's my understanding that the so
 
01:53:56.589 --> 01:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
the data goes from the hipac covered
 
01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
entity which is the provider goes to the
 
01:54:01.669 --> 01:54:01.679 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State which is um then the
 
01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
steward of the data throughou it is
 
01:54:06.350 --> 01:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
given to the Department of Health and
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
Human Services that's the extent of like
 
01:54:10.830 --> 01:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
what we're testifying on the use of it
 
01:54:13.109 --> 01:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
as I believe submission to National
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
Center for Health statistics is done by
 
01:54:18.229 --> 01:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State not not the
 
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:54:21.310 --> 01:54:21.320 align:start position:0%
and that would feed into the national
 
01:54:23.310 --> 01:54:23.320 align:start position:0%
vital statistics system so there's
 
01:54:25.629 --> 01:54:25.639 align:start position:0%
there's really only those there's to CDC
 
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
and there's to the Department of Health
 
01:54:28.350 --> 01:54:28.360 align:start position:0%
and Human
 
01:54:32.910 --> 01:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
Services and yes so based on the New
 
01:54:39.189 --> 01:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law RSA 126 uh 24 25 um the
 
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
department also performed as a kind like
 
01:54:45.189 --> 01:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
a uh as a data release mechanism for the
 
01:54:48.030 --> 01:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
health related research so for the vital
 
01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
records data currently we have a vital
 
01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
record privacy board that is a
 
01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
collaboration between the department and
 
01:54:58.109 --> 01:54:58.119 align:start position:0%
the uh Secretary of State uh the
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
division of V Rec Administration it's a
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
a review board to review all the health
 
01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
related research request that require
 
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
more granular Vital Records uh data for
 
01:55:12.990 --> 01:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
their own research with IRB approval
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
with all the very comprehensive
 
01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
applications um and also address the
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
purpose how they Safeguard the data
 
01:55:22.069 --> 01:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
though this kind of request will all go
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
to to the V record privacy board uh for
 
01:55:27.990 --> 01:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
us to release after the Board review and
 
01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
approve and also after the data sharing
 
01:55:33.069 --> 01:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
agreement established then the
 
01:55:35.709 --> 01:55:35.719 align:start position:0%
department would be able to release the
 
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
data as necessary as request to the
 
01:55:41.149 --> 01:55:41.159 align:start position:0%
researchers so that is another channel
 
01:55:44.189 --> 01:55:44.199 align:start position:0%
that uh um for the health related
 
01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
research um we do have this mechanism to
 
01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
release the
 
01:55:51.310 --> 01:55:51.320 align:start position:0%
data representative Castle W and then
 
01:55:53.069 --> 01:55:53.079 align:start position:0%
representative mlan
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:55:56.030 --> 01:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I'm looking here a
 
01:55:58.910 --> 01:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
lot about what it says here in RSA
 
01:56:01.470 --> 01:56:01.480 align:start position:0%
5-c and the question that I have is
 
01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:03.800 align:start position:0%
specifically to the question let's say
 
01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
the questions on this sheet What
 
01:56:08.589 --> 01:56:08.599 align:start position:0%
specifically would be required because
 
01:56:11.229 --> 01:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
under the RSA it looks like name age and
 
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
sex is all that's required so can you
 
01:56:16.270 --> 01:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
give me on depending on who it is yeah
 
01:56:18.750 --> 01:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
so um in the written testimony that we
 
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
passed around we flagged what we
 
01:56:23.109 --> 01:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
considered to be the technical defects
 
01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
of the legislation and one of those um
 
01:56:27.870 --> 01:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
that was called out was the definition
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
of minimum amount of information is not
 
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
clear it's used in lines 710 and 20 of
 
01:56:36.550 --> 01:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
the legislation but it's not defined and
 
01:56:38.030 --> 01:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
um as you've heard from like the newborn
 
01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.159 align:start position:0%
screening program personal identifying
 
01:56:42.189 --> 01:56:42.199 align:start position:0%
information would be a minimum amount
 
01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
required to do that program so that's
 
01:56:47.470 --> 01:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
unclear and would need to be articulated
 
01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
follow up could you clarify what that
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
personal information might be based on
 
01:56:57.229 --> 01:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
this to you yes so from the uh
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
statistical report uh standpoint that uh
 
01:57:02.990 --> 01:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
we will need to have like a raise as
 
01:57:05.229 --> 01:57:05.239 align:start position:0%
necessity and also data birth in order
 
01:57:09.229 --> 01:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
to calculate the mother's um age at
 
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
Birth as well as the town Zip Code or
 
01:57:15.870 --> 01:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
and also the uh residential area so uh
 
01:57:18.189 --> 01:57:18.199 align:start position:0%
residential address excuse me so that we
 
01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
can do GE coding uh to identify the
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
census TR sensor block for more granular
 
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
statistic reporting so those type of
 
01:57:29.709 --> 01:57:29.719 align:start position:0%
personal identifiers is what will be
 
01:57:31.750 --> 01:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
needed uh what would be needed for the
 
01:57:33.950 --> 01:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
statistical reporting but for other
 
01:57:37.189 --> 01:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
identifiers such as um infant in
 
01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
newborns names and mother's name date of
 
01:57:42.310 --> 01:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
birth Etc are utilized by not only
 
01:57:44.510 --> 01:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
newbor screen but later on you will hear
 
01:57:47.229 --> 01:57:47.239 align:start position:0%
the uh testimony from other divisions uh
 
01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
under the department that they use that
 
01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:56.990 --> 01:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
Etc representa
 
01:57:59.950 --> 01:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
mlan yeah thank you Mr chair and I
 
01:58:01.790 --> 01:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
actually have two questions one on
 
01:58:03.550 --> 01:58:03.560 align:start position:0%
providing of information and the second
 
01:58:07.310 --> 01:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
on providing of services so do you know
 
01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
at at what time the written notice would
 
01:58:14.470 --> 01:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
be given to the mother and the reason
 
01:58:16.470 --> 01:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
that I ask is because a lot of the
 
01:58:18.229 --> 01:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
personal information that goes really
 
01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
deep is on that that second part um and
 
01:58:23.310 --> 01:58:23.320 align:start position:0%
you're saying that's actually not
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
provide that's provided from the
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
facility itself and so I'm wondering um
 
01:58:31.790 --> 01:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
the mother being notified may not want
 
01:58:34.390 --> 01:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
to provide this but it's already all
 
01:58:37.790 --> 01:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
being done anyway even without her doing
 
01:58:41.310 --> 01:58:41.320 align:start position:0%
it so does she have an opportunity to
 
01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
review this final worksheet to say I
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
didn't provide that and can I get that
 
01:58:49.310 --> 01:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
gone or is it too late at that point so
 
01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:51.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand the timing
 
01:58:53.430 --> 01:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
and since some that stuff doesn't come
 
01:58:56.069 --> 01:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
from her I don't want that but it's
 
01:58:57.149 --> 01:58:57.159 align:start position:0%
there anyway you know you know what I'm
 
01:58:58.750 --> 01:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
saying so could you maybe talk to that
 
01:58:59.910 --> 01:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
and then the second question would be
 
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
about providing a service is going a
 
01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:03.270 align:start position:0%
about providing a service is going a
hold

01:59:03.270 --> 01:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
hold
 
01:59:05.149 --> 01:59:05.159 align:start position:0%
on um
 
01:59:08.350 --> 01:59:08.360 align:start position:0%
so the data that's collected in in the
 
01:59:10.589 --> 01:59:10.599 align:start position:0%
electronic health record I can't speak
 
01:59:12.629 --> 01:59:12.639 align:start position:0%
to what each provider or office or
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
Hospital does in terms of dis you know
 
01:59:16.629 --> 01:59:16.639 align:start position:0%
notifying an individual about how
 
01:59:19.069 --> 01:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
they'll use the data but certainly a
 
01:59:20.709 --> 01:59:20.719 align:start position:0%
woman has a choice of whether to share
 
01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
data at any point in time you know um
 
01:59:25.750 --> 01:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
some of the things that the facility
 
01:59:27.790 --> 01:59:27.800 align:start position:0%
reports I would guarantee that a woman
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
is declining to share anyway with her
 
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
provider so they all they already have
 
01:59:34.069 --> 01:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
that choice at the point when they're
 
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:35.679 align:start position:0%
having that conversation or getting
 
01:59:38.069 --> 01:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
clinical care is generally like the
 
01:59:40.669 --> 01:59:40.679 align:start position:0%
context in which they're Gathering that
 
01:59:42.830 --> 01:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
information in terms of the proposed
 
01:59:45.709 --> 01:59:45.719 align:start position:0%
legislation and the in the um
 
01:59:48.350 --> 01:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
requirement around notification that is
 
01:59:51.229 --> 01:59:51.239 align:start position:0%
not clearly spelled out when or where or
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
how that notification would occur so it
 
01:59:55.149 --> 01:59:55.159 align:start position:0%
could certainly occur at the point of
 
01:59:56.830 --> 01:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
data collection which would be between
 
01:59:59.189 --> 01:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
the clinician and the the mother or it
 
02:00:01.270 --> 02:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
could be at that point when somebody's
 
02:00:03.550 --> 02:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
just given birth and they are with their
 
02:00:06.149 --> 02:00:06.159 align:start position:0%
newborn baby and trying to you know go
 
02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
home and it could be there that they're
 
02:00:09.550 --> 02:00:09.560 align:start position:0%
being shown this worksheet and making
 
02:00:11.830 --> 02:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
decisions about um I do want to say
 
02:00:13.950 --> 02:00:13.960 align:start position:0%
though that the the law was changed I
 
02:00:17.109 --> 02:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
believe last year to an enable women to
 
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
decide not to supply certain data so
 
02:00:23.229 --> 02:00:23.239 align:start position:0%
that's already an option so um and then
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
when the birth worksheet submitted it
 
02:00:27.030 --> 02:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
would just indicate you know declined to
 
02:00:29.030 --> 02:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
provide this information so so they're
 
02:00:31.069 --> 02:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
notified as it's being
 
02:00:33.950 --> 02:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
asked and so the second question with
 
02:00:36.589 --> 02:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
respect to the services provided I kind
 
02:00:39.790 --> 02:00:39.800 align:start position:0%
of understand um your point about we
 
02:00:42.270 --> 02:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
have a lot of births that are happening
 
02:00:44.430 --> 02:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
outside of healthc care facilities so I
 
02:00:47.950 --> 02:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
can understand how throughout a extended
 
02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
chain there may be gaps in being able to
 
02:00:52.470 --> 02:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
provide service um
 
02:00:56.030 --> 02:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
but for those folks that are born in a
 
02:00:59.189 --> 02:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
hospital setting um I I would think you
 
02:01:03.229 --> 02:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
know they're right there so um does the
 
02:01:06.910 --> 02:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
linkage problem exist even at that point
 
02:01:08.109 --> 02:01:08.119 align:start position:0%
or is it
 
02:01:15.390 --> 02:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:18.069 --> 02:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
hospital thank you for your question so
 
02:01:20.589 --> 02:01:20.599 align:start position:0%
it happens outside of the hospital so
 
02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:22.719 align:start position:0%
there is linkages that happen at the the
 
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
hospital as far as newborn screening
 
02:01:28.870 --> 02:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
goes that is after so a test is done for
 
02:01:31.470 --> 02:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
these 37 heritable conditions it is sent
 
02:01:33.550 --> 02:01:33.560 align:start position:0%
to our contracted laboratory to run the
 
02:01:36.030 --> 02:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
test from there we need mom's
 
02:01:39.790 --> 02:01:39.800 align:start position:0%
information to link with the results so
 
02:01:41.830 --> 02:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
that we make sure all babies are
 
02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%
screened who want to be screened just
 
02:01:48.350 --> 02:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
put follow follow up so does this mean
 
02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
then that you go and you do the testing
 
02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
on the Bab
 
02:01:54.629 --> 02:01:54.639 align:start position:0%
and you've got the info but I have no
 
02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
way to notify the mother so the program
 
02:01:59.950 --> 02:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
notifies the provider okay so what it
 
02:02:01.589 --> 02:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
means is that if we don't have Mom's
 
02:02:03.390 --> 02:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
information we don't know what babies
 
02:02:05.790 --> 02:02:05.800 align:start position:0%
are not screened so we would only
 
02:02:08.310 --> 02:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
receive those who are so there could be
 
02:02:10.030 --> 02:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
a chance that a baby would go home and
 
02:02:11.910 --> 02:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
missed by accident and those are the
 
02:02:14.310 --> 02:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
ones that we are trying to catch through
 
02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
the linkage thank
 
02:02:19.229 --> 02:02:19.239 align:start position:0%
you anyone else representative Castle
 
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
ring just a quick followup on the
 
02:02:23.310 --> 02:02:23.320 align:start position:0%
previous question uh when it comes to
 
02:02:25.589 --> 02:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
opting out you mentioned is there any
 
02:02:27.270 --> 02:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
can they opt out to anything on that
 
02:02:28.629 --> 02:02:28.639 align:start position:0%
list or is there anything that they
 
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
can't so as it's my understanding and
 
02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
I'll let y way chime in um there are
 
02:02:35.229 --> 02:02:35.239 align:start position:0%
certain components that are related
 
02:02:36.750 --> 02:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
specifically to issuing the birth
 
02:02:38.910 --> 02:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
certificate that are not optional so
 
02:02:41.149 --> 02:02:41.159 align:start position:0%
that goes back to my story of like I had
 
02:02:43.870 --> 02:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
to give my kid a name you can't opt out
 
02:02:45.390 --> 02:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
of naming your child because then you
 
02:02:47.669 --> 02:02:47.679 align:start position:0%
can't produce a birth certificate but
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
then uh the majority of what's in the
 
02:02:52.189 --> 02:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
facility worksheet is not tied to the
 
02:02:54.550 --> 02:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
issuing of a birth certificate and can
 
02:02:57.350 --> 02:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
be opted out of I'll just let Jo chime
 
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:03.149 --> 02:03:03.159 align:start position:0%
missed that's correct that is our
 
02:03:05.629 --> 02:03:05.639 align:start position:0%
understanding as well uh so if the model
 
02:03:08.109 --> 02:03:08.119 align:start position:0%
does not fill out uh the race as
 
02:03:10.830 --> 02:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
necessity then you know there's no
 
02:03:12.790 --> 02:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
penalty on that but they do need to
 
02:03:15.870 --> 02:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
based on the current um bus worksheet
 
02:03:17.229 --> 02:03:17.239 align:start position:0%
that they do need to provide the
 
02:03:20.589 --> 02:03:20.599 align:start position:0%
accurate um the truthful information to
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
be utilized on the certificate so they
 
02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
do have the chance to not to fill it out
 
02:03:28.390 --> 02:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
whether they smoke whether they how how
 
02:03:31.470 --> 02:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
how tall they are or how heavy they were
 
02:03:33.430 --> 02:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
when they pregnant so those are the
 
02:03:36.109 --> 02:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
information they can um they don't need
 
02:03:39.149 --> 02:03:39.159 align:start position:0%
to provide and then um I cannot speak
 
02:03:42.430 --> 02:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
for how that will be recorded recorded
 
02:03:45.149 --> 02:03:45.159 align:start position:0%
in the v record statistic system but it
 
02:03:47.709 --> 02:03:47.719 align:start position:0%
will be unknown or not available this
 
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
type of
 
02:03:52.229 --> 02:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
information okay any last question
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
questions seeing done okay thank you
 
02:03:54.800 --> 02:04:02.790 align:start position:0%
questions seeing done okay thank you
thank

02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:05.189 --> 02:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak from the
 
02:04:18.709 --> 02:04:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:21.709 --> 02:04:21.719 align:start position:0%
Hebert good morning morning my name is
 
02:04:24.030 --> 02:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
my name is Karen Hebert uh and I am the
 
02:04:26.350 --> 02:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
director for the division of economic
 
02:04:27.709 --> 02:04:27.719 align:start position:0%
stability at
 
02:04:30.390 --> 02:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
DHHS and I'm here joining my colleagues
 
02:04:33.470 --> 02:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill uh which
 
02:04:36.270 --> 02:04:36.280 align:start position:0%
would essentially lead to an inability
 
02:04:38.510 --> 02:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
to access
 
02:04:41.750 --> 02:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh data points that are documented at
 
02:04:44.270 --> 02:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
this time on the birth record
 
02:04:46.950 --> 02:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
worksheet this would have adverse uh
 
02:04:50.629 --> 02:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
impacts on services from this division
 
02:04:52.870 --> 02:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
in a couple of different programs so the
 
02:04:54.589 --> 02:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
division accesses vital records
 
02:04:57.229 --> 02:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
information including birth death
 
02:05:00.790 --> 02:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
marriage and paternity status via the
 
02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
system that includes the file
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%

name the date of birth of all parties
 
02:05:14.830 --> 02:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
whether a paternity affidavit has been
 
02:05:18.430 --> 02:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
filed and when and the mother's marital
 
02:05:22.069 --> 02:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
status at the time
 
02:05:24.750 --> 02:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
the department must be able to verify
 
02:05:27.270 --> 02:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
the legal relationship between an
 
02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
applicant for Public Assistance programs
 
02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
and a child for whom they are applying
 
02:05:36.270 --> 02:05:36.280 align:start position:0%
on behalf of this includes but is not
 
02:05:38.149 --> 02:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
limited to the temporary assistance for
 
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
needy families which is a cash program

program which is food stamps child care
and

02:05:47.790 --> 02:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:05:51.069 --> 02:05:51.079 align:start position:0%
Medicaid the child's birth record is the
 
02:05:53.390 --> 02:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
verification document required by the
 
02:05:55.350 --> 02:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
federal government for eligibility in
 
02:05:55.360 --> 02:05:56.750 align:start position:0%
federal government for eligibility in
these

02:05:56.750 --> 02:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:05.109 --> 02:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
acceptable the department must also be
 
02:06:08.430 --> 02:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
able to verify the legal status of a
 
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
child born to a
 
02:06:12.629 --> 02:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
non-citizen If the child were born in
 
02:06:15.069 --> 02:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
the United States then the child's birth
 
02:06:17.470 --> 02:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
record is the verification document
 
02:06:19.589 --> 02:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
required by the federal government for
 
02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:22.320 align:start position:0%

benefits without access to this vital
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
record data the state will be at risk of
 
02:06:29.830 --> 02:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh federal financial penalties or loss
 
02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
of federal funding without this
 
02:06:34.549 --> 02:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
verification benefits to individuals and
 
02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
families could be
 
02:06:40.510 --> 02:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
denied for services and child support
 
02:06:42.510 --> 02:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
one of the primary responsibilities of
 
02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
this program is to establish parentage
 
02:06:48.589 --> 02:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
and paternity also referred to as legal
 
02:06:51.149 --> 02:06:51.159 align:start position:0%
fatherhood paternity establishment is a
 
02:06:53.270 --> 02:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
necess first step in the child support
 
02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement process in cases where a
 
02:06:58.069 --> 02:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
child is born out of
 
02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
wedlock we must be able to establish the
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
relationship between the mother and
 
02:07:06.830 --> 02:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
child and father and child access to
 
02:07:08.589 --> 02:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
vital records information by this
 
02:07:10.189 --> 02:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
program is required by the Social
 
02:07:15.149 --> 02:07:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:17.470 --> 02:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
4-D the Department's Child Support
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
Program serves approximately 30,000
 
02:07:22.510 --> 02:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
families at any point in time in a year
 
02:07:27.350 --> 02:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
the department collects if I may I under
 
02:07:29.709 --> 02:07:29.719 align:start position:0%
underestimated the child support program
 
02:07:32.189 --> 02:07:32.199 align:start position:0%
collects about $78 million annually for
 
02:07:34.109 --> 02:07:34.119 align:start position:0%
the families that we serve for some
 
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
families this is their only source of
 
02:07:38.310 --> 02:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
income the unintended impacts of this
 
02:07:39.990 --> 02:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
bill would impact Children and Families
 
02:07:42.390 --> 02:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
from receiving financial and medical
 
02:07:45.270 --> 02:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
support that is due or owed to them the
 
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
department cannot establish a legal
 
02:07:48.910 --> 02:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
order for child and medical support
 
02:07:52.589 --> 02:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
without first establishing and verifying
 
02:07:54.990 --> 02:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
paternity in addition to providing a
 
02:07:57.709 --> 02:07:57.719 align:start position:0%
basis for legal orders for child and
 
02:07:59.950 --> 02:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
medical support establishing legal
 
02:08:01.629 --> 02:08:01.639 align:start position:0%
parentage can provide important
 
02:08:04.149 --> 02:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
necessities and entitlements for that
 
02:08:07.870 --> 02:08:07.880 align:start position:0%
child please wrapping up I will that
 
02:08:10.030 --> 02:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
includes soci Security benefits pension
 
02:08:12.390 --> 02:08:12.400 align:start position:0%

02:08:19.350 --> 02:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
history without being able to verify
 
02:08:22.390 --> 02:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
this information the state would
 
02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately see an increase in the
 
02:08:27.589 --> 02:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
utilization of Public Assistance
 
02:08:30.549 --> 02:08:30.559 align:start position:0%

02:08:33.069 --> 02:08:33.079 align:start position:0%
by way of the tanif block
 
02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
grant okay thank you any
 
02:08:39.470 --> 02:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:08:43.149 --> 02:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
mlan so I haven't seen Senate Bill 92
 
02:08:45.270 --> 02:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
but there was um discussion about it
 
02:08:48.189 --> 02:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
earlier and that it does an anonymize
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
data um have you seen that bill and um
 
02:08:54.830 --> 02:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh the people who spoke previously seem
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
to be supportive of it does it address
 
02:09:00.030 --> 02:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
your concerns I will have to take a
 
02:09:01.709 --> 02:09:01.719 align:start position:0%
closer look at that particular bill I
 
02:09:04.189 --> 02:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
apologize I've have not reviewed
 
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
it any other questions representative
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
Castle ring thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:09:09.669 --> 02:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
for taking my question has there ever
 
02:09:11.790 --> 02:09:11.800 align:start position:0%
been a case where you've had an a parent
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
that has opted out of any information to
 
02:09:15.790 --> 02:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
the department like for what you said is
 
02:09:17.470 --> 02:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
vital for the Department to
 
02:09:21.510 --> 02:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
have yes so the birth record worksheet
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
as I said will contain the names of uh
 
02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
both parents um however we have
 
02:09:28.270 --> 02:09:28.280 align:start position:0%
certainly seen circumstances where the
 
02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:30.639 align:start position:0%
mother will refuse to provide who she
 
02:09:33.990 --> 02:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
believes is the father's name um and uh
 
02:09:36.629 --> 02:09:36.639 align:start position:0%
or sometimes providing the name of the
 
02:09:39.149 --> 02:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
husband so in those circumstances there
 
02:09:41.549 --> 02:09:41.559 align:start position:0%
is a process in place to S reconcile
 
02:09:44.270 --> 02:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
that should that parent then later apply
 
02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
for public assistance benefits or Child
 
02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:47.950 align:start position:0%
for public assistance benefits or Child
Support

02:09:47.950 --> 02:09:47.960 align:start position:0%

whether uh
 
02:11:10.430 --> 02:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
unidentifiable uh aggregate data will be
 
02:11:13.390 --> 02:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
enough to support some of the programs

provided quite a bit of testimony um my
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
my testimony would have been geared more
 
02:11:30.510 --> 02:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
towards the vital statistics and the the
 
02:11:32.910 --> 02:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
birth certificate issues that uh
 
02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:36.880 align:start position:0%

here good morning my name is Janelle
 
02:12:20.589 --> 02:12:20.599 align:start position:0%
leian I am the attorney for and general
 
02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
counsel for for the
 
02:12:25.589 --> 02:12:25.599 align:start position:0%
Department's estate Recovery
 
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
Unit I want to talk about a few things
 
02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
today that I think are different from
 
02:12:32.790 --> 02:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
what you've heard but one thing I want
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
to emphasize and I cannot emphasize this
 
02:12:38.430 --> 02:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
enough all of the department every
 
02:12:41.629 --> 02:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
single one of us is restricted by
 
02:12:44.310 --> 02:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
numerous confidentiality Provisions in
 
02:12:47.149 --> 02:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
the law not just Hippa um there are
 
02:12:49.589 --> 02:12:49.599 align:start position:0%
numerous State statutes as well that
 
02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
protect protect data and we take it very
 
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
seriously the estate Recovery Unit is a
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
federally mandated practice to recover
 
02:13:00.030 --> 02:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
from Medicaid correctly paid under
 
02:13:02.589 --> 02:13:02.599 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances from Mostly
 
02:13:05.390 --> 02:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
deceased recipients of
 
02:13:08.189 --> 02:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
Medicaid it is something that is
 
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
required for the state and federal
 
02:13:13.470 --> 02:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
partnership in the Medicaid Program to
 
02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
exist to accomplish this we must have
 
02:13:20.629 --> 02:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
birth death marriage and divorce records
 
02:13:22.669 --> 02:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
in order to properly carry out our
 
02:13:24.950 --> 02:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
federally mandated
 
02:13:28.149 --> 02:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
function Federal this is so because
 
02:13:30.030 --> 02:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
recovery must be done consistent with
 
02:13:32.549 --> 02:13:32.559 align:start position:0%
the federal law the state law as well as
 
02:13:32.559 --> 02:13:34.549 align:start position:0%
the federal law the state law as well as
probate

02:13:34.549 --> 02:13:34.559 align:start position:0%
probate
 
02:13:37.790 --> 02:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
law if the estate Recovery Unit fails to
 
02:13:40.149 --> 02:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
properly perform its function not only
 
02:13:43.430 --> 02:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
will recovery decrease and at this point
 
02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
I'd like to add that at this point on
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
average we recover about $6.7 million a
 
02:13:52.510 --> 02:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
year approximately two to $3 million a
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
year it goes to the state general fund
 
02:13:59.069 --> 02:13:59.079 align:start position:0%
that recovery that we do is on behalf of
 
02:14:00.390 --> 02:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
the federal government the state
 
02:14:02.709 --> 02:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
government and the counties if
 
02:14:04.990 --> 02:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
recoveries decrease because we can't get
 
02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
the data that we need we not only expose
 
02:14:11.189 --> 02:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
the state to reduce General funds but we
 
02:14:15.069 --> 02:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
also expose the state to litigation by
 
02:14:17.709 --> 02:14:17.719 align:start position:0%
the federal government most seriously
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
but if we're inappropriately recovering
 
02:14:23.549 --> 02:14:23.559 align:start position:0%
from individ ual as well the federal
 
02:14:25.589 --> 02:14:25.599 align:start position:0%
government has the capability and has
 
02:14:28.310 --> 02:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
done so in other states to come in to
 
02:14:30.350 --> 02:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
and shut down medicaid where the state
 
02:14:32.990 --> 02:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
has not properly not in New Hampshire
 
02:14:35.350 --> 02:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
but where a state has not properly
 
02:14:38.109 --> 02:14:38.119 align:start position:0%
engaged in a state recovery
 
02:14:40.750 --> 02:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
practices so I guess the key point I'm
 
02:14:43.709 --> 02:14:43.719 align:start position:0%
going try to keep this as short as I can
 
02:14:46.390 --> 02:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
the key Point here is that we're not
 
02:14:48.669 --> 02:14:48.679 align:start position:0%
just collecting this in information the
 
02:14:50.109 --> 02:14:50.119 align:start position:0%
department is not collecting this
 
02:14:51.790 --> 02:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
information just for the heck of it or
 
02:14:54.310 --> 02:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly we are performing an
 
02:14:57.589 --> 02:14:57.599 align:start position:0%
essential Public Service in every way
 
02:14:59.390 --> 02:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
not just what I do but what all of my
 
02:15:01.470 --> 02:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
colleagues have said before
 
02:15:05.470 --> 02:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
me it's important for the public good
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
and for the public
 
02:15:09.629 --> 02:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
welfare there are so many safeguards
 
02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
already in place we do this we take it
 
02:15:15.390 --> 02:15:15.400 align:start position:0%
seriously and it's essential and
 
02:15:18.790 --> 02:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
important work to be able to not be able
 
02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:21.599 align:start position:0%
to have this data will shut so many
 
02:15:21.599 --> 02:15:22.510 align:start position:0%
to have this data will shut so many
things

02:15:22.510 --> 02:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:15:25.470 --> 02:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
down so I guess I'll keep it at that if
 
02:15:28.790 --> 02:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
there are any questions thank you
 
02:15:32.109 --> 02:15:32.119 align:start position:0%
representative we Weber sorry and I'm so
 
02:15:33.950 --> 02:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
sorry I had to step out for a couple of
 
02:15:36.629 --> 02:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
minutes but could you give me just a few
 
02:15:38.750 --> 02:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
examples of what would have to be shut
 
02:15:41.350 --> 02:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
down so I will give you examples my
 
02:15:43.189 --> 02:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
colleagues have already spoken to their
 
02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
programs but if I cannot get proper
 
02:15:49.069 --> 02:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
birth records for example I will not be
 
02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
able to perform Medicaid recovery
 
02:15:54.750 --> 02:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
properly I need to be able to know
 
02:15:56.950 --> 02:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
whether someone is survived by a spouse
 
02:16:00.629 --> 02:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
or not I need to know who that is same
 
02:16:03.589 --> 02:16:03.599 align:start position:0%
as Miss Hebert testified to earlier self
 
02:16:05.629 --> 02:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
attestation is not something I'm allowed
 
02:16:05.639 --> 02:16:06.549 align:start position:0%
attestation is not something I'm allowed
to

02:16:06.549 --> 02:16:06.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:16:09.549 --> 02:16:09.559 align:start position:0%
accept I have to have the official
 
02:16:12.189 --> 02:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
record I need to know who surviving
 
02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
children are and I need to know their
 
02:16:15.950 --> 02:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
status because it is inappropriate for
 
02:16:18.310 --> 02:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
me to recover when someone is under the
 
02:16:21.069 --> 02:16:21.079 align:start position:0%
age of 21 and they are the surviving
 
02:16:23.830 --> 02:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
child of a recipient or when that child
 
02:16:26.990 --> 02:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
is blind or disabled I have to get that
 
02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
right in order to carry out what we do
 
02:16:31.669 --> 02:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
properly and I take it very seriously
 
02:16:35.910 --> 02:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
02:16:38.509 --> 02:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
paulov thank you Madame chair thank you
 
02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so you were
 
02:16:44.629 --> 02:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
talking about proper birth
 
02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
records so and but uh Bill sponsor here
 
02:16:53.910 --> 02:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
he outlined several different uh types
 
02:16:57.230 --> 02:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
of information he's concerned with so do
 
02:16:59.669 --> 02:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
I understand correctly that your concern
 
02:17:03.990 --> 02:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
is mostly with uh domestic status and
 
02:17:08.030 --> 02:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
marriage and you wouldn't be so concern
 
02:17:12.190 --> 02:17:12.200 align:start position:0%
if mother say says that she doesn't want
 
02:17:14.750 --> 02:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
you to know that she has clamidia or
 
02:17:17.110 --> 02:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
some other
 
02:17:19.389 --> 02:17:19.399 align:start position:0%
diseases well my colleagues do have
 
02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
those concerns and they're very legit
 
02:17:22.709 --> 02:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
legate concerns that is not something
 
02:17:27.509 --> 02:17:27.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:31.230 --> 02:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
unit thank you representative mlan so
 
02:17:33.070 --> 02:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
just to clarify then the portion of the
 
02:17:34.589 --> 02:17:34.599 align:start position:0%
bill that you're really concerned with
 
02:17:36.709 --> 02:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
is the last portion that is the
 
02:17:39.389 --> 02:17:39.399 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding that
 
02:17:41.190 --> 02:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
basically is limiting the sharing not
 
02:17:43.629 --> 02:17:43.639 align:start position:0%
some of the stuff where we're having the
 
02:17:46.270 --> 02:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
anonymized about the others the whole
 
02:17:48.589 --> 02:17:48.599 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding basically
 
02:17:49.669 --> 02:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
throws a
 
02:17:53.190 --> 02:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
wrench it does I have to be able to link
 
02:17:56.190 --> 02:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
mother to child and father to child
 
02:17:58.389 --> 02:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
marriage divorce I have to be able to do
 
02:18:00.830 --> 02:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
that to do my job properly yes I'm one
 
02:18:04.830 --> 02:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
small Cog and a bigger wheel but it is
 
02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
important thank you any further
 
02:18:13.230 --> 02:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:17.309 --> 02:18:17.319 align:start position:0%
you right next I see Francesca Hennessy
 
02:18:19.309 --> 02:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
and Lindsay
 
02:18:23.830 --> 02:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
bio from d HHS yes yes good morning good
 
02:18:25.669 --> 02:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
morning and how much time do you need
 
02:18:28.230 --> 02:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
for the both of you three minutes three
 
02:18:30.429 --> 02:18:30.439 align:start position:0%
minutes total yes
 
02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
okay my name is Franchesca Hennessy I am
 
02:18:36.429 --> 02:18:36.439 align:start position:0%
the um administrator for fraud waste and
 
02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
abuse at the Department of Health and
 
02:18:39.990 --> 02:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
Human Services and I have here our
 
02:18:41.910 --> 02:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
special investigations administrator
 
02:18:45.349 --> 02:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
Lindsay bio and so we are I want to talk
 
02:18:47.950 --> 02:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
about how we use personal identifiers in
 
02:18:49.389 --> 02:18:49.399 align:start position:0%
investigations for special
 
02:18:51.669 --> 02:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
investigations and how we would be
 
02:18:53.429 --> 02:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
hamstring without those personal
 
02:18:55.509 --> 02:18:55.519 align:start position:0%
identifiers so if we don't have the
 
02:18:57.549 --> 02:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
social security numbers of parents and
 
02:19:00.790 --> 02:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
children we cannot identify families who
 
02:19:03.150 --> 02:19:03.160 align:start position:0%
should or should not be in a household
 
02:19:05.469 --> 02:19:05.479 align:start position:0%
this would infect our investigations and
 
02:19:07.429 --> 02:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
it would ultimately affect our
 
02:19:09.509 --> 02:19:09.519 align:start position:0%
recoveries um we would not be able to
 
02:19:11.349 --> 02:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
put or the staff would not be able to
 
02:19:14.950 --> 02:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
put cases together um other examples of
 
02:19:16.589 --> 02:19:16.599 align:start position:0%
this is if we don't have a Social
 
02:19:19.070 --> 02:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
Security number to validate income with
 
02:19:21.910 --> 02:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
employers we would not be able to prove
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
income and again put an income based
 
02:19:29.110 --> 02:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
case together um we also use in property
 
02:19:31.950 --> 02:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
information such as where um a person
 
02:19:35.469 --> 02:19:35.479 align:start position:0%
individual lives um this is Vital
 
02:19:38.190 --> 02:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
Information for a special investigations
 
02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
case if we don't have that name and date
 
02:19:42.150 --> 02:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
of birth and where they live we can't
 
02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:45.599 align:start position:0%
put that case together um if we don't
 
02:19:48.670 --> 02:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
have pii including name social security
 
02:19:51.070 --> 02:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
number and date of birth and address we
 
02:19:54.070 --> 02:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
may pursue the wrong individual based on
 
02:19:56.309 --> 02:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
limited information which could cause
 
02:19:59.190 --> 02:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
delays in our investigation again I end
 
02:20:01.070 --> 02:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
all of these with it would affect our
 
02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
recoveries to the state um and again I
 
02:20:07.270 --> 02:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
know we talked about what are those
 
02:20:09.349 --> 02:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
personal identifiers the ones we are
 
02:20:11.150 --> 02:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
concerned with since it's not defined in
 
02:20:13.389 --> 02:20:13.399 align:start position:0%
the law are social security numbers
 
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
address date of birth um is there
 
02:20:18.150 --> 02:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
anything else Lindsay um I'd just like
 
02:20:20.790 --> 02:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
to add all the uh all the information on
 
02:20:22.950 --> 02:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
the mother's birth worksheet such as
 
02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
those deeply personal questions those
 
02:20:28.110 --> 02:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
aren't something that we have access to
 
02:20:31.389 --> 02:20:31.399 align:start position:0%
in the system all we have access to are
 
02:20:35.870 --> 02:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
those those pii um identifiers linking
 
02:20:37.910 --> 02:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
the mother the child the father together
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
as one unit all that other data we don't
 
02:20:43.870 --> 02:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
even see when we look into the
 
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
system and that's all I have to
 
02:20:49.870 --> 02:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
add thank you does the committee have
 
02:20:53.110 --> 02:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:57.710 --> 02:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:15.070 --> 02:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:17.990 --> 02:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
Kirk good morning Madam chairman and to
 
02:21:19.750 --> 02:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee good morning
 
02:21:22.389 --> 02:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Kirk I live in we and
 
02:21:25.230 --> 02:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
I'm representing myself I'd like to make
 
02:21:28.309 --> 02:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
eight points Point number one if you
 
02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
look at the 34 uh 25 um copy of the bill
 
02:21:36.550 --> 02:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
you'll see there are two pages of uh
 
02:21:38.110 --> 02:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
listing of federal funds that may be
 
02:21:42.349 --> 02:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
lost varying from 25 12.5 to $25
 
02:21:46.110 --> 02:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
million um please note that there are
 
02:21:48.270 --> 02:21:48.280 align:start position:0%
two assumptions on this on which that's
 
02:21:49.990 --> 02:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
based number one that the feds will in
 
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
fact deny the money and number two that
 
02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
100% of the of the mothers in this state
 
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
are going to opt out under the bill both
 
02:21:59.670 --> 02:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
of them are totally
 
02:22:01.710 --> 02:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
unrealistic if you're serious about
 
02:22:04.270 --> 02:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
looking at the money then require DHHS
 
02:22:06.030 --> 02:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
to provide letters from federal
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
officials stating that they will not May
 
02:22:11.950 --> 02:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
which is some cases will cut the funds
 
02:22:14.670 --> 02:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
or leave the financial consequences to
 
02:22:16.349 --> 02:22:16.359 align:start position:0%
house finance because if this bill
 
02:22:17.990 --> 02:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
passes because of the fiscal Noe it's
 
02:22:21.190 --> 02:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
likely to go there point two
 
02:22:22.590 --> 02:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
the assumption that all birth mothers
 
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
are going to opt out is unrealistic the
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
department of safety has a variety of
 
02:22:28.830 --> 02:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
opt outs for your photograph and for
 
02:22:31.389 --> 02:22:31.399 align:start position:0%
your social security number and when I
 
02:22:33.389 --> 02:22:33.399 align:start position:0%
checked several years ago uh
 
02:22:36.590 --> 02:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
approximately 3% of people were opting
 
02:22:39.710 --> 02:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
out of those Provisions 3% not
 
02:22:42.270 --> 02:22:42.280 align:start position:0%
100% point
 
02:22:42.280 --> 02:22:44.270 align:start position:0%
100% point
three

02:22:44.270 --> 02:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:22:46.910 --> 02:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
um the world will not end if some
 
02:22:50.190 --> 02:22:50.200 align:start position:0%
portion of new mothers opt out indeed uh
 
02:22:51.710 --> 02:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
the Department states that it has a
 
02:22:53.389 --> 02:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
procedure in place when new mothers
 
02:22:55.710 --> 02:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
refuse to provide information but notice
 
02:22:57.790 --> 02:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
how deceptive this is because while the
 
02:22:59.469 --> 02:22:59.479 align:start position:0%
mothers May provide the information the
 
02:23:00.990 --> 02:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
hospital is going to fill in the blanks
 
02:23:03.230 --> 02:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
where they can so it's only some
 
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
information that in fact the mothers
 
02:23:07.750 --> 02:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
refus to provide that don't end up on
 
02:23:08.750 --> 02:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
the bir
 
02:23:11.349 --> 02:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
sheet um
 
02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
so DHHS is already dealing with the
 
02:23:16.389 --> 02:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
purported loss of Revenue and lack of
 
02:23:19.230 --> 02:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
100% participation from mothers who
 
02:23:21.429 --> 02:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
refuse to provide information
 
02:23:23.230 --> 02:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
so why should the department object if
 
02:23:25.309 --> 02:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
it tells new mothers that they may opt
 
02:23:28.950 --> 02:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
out why keep the practice a secret it's
 
02:23:28.960 --> 02:23:29.950 align:start position:0%
out why keep the practice a secret it's
terribly

02:23:29.950 --> 02:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
terribly
 
02:23:32.150 --> 02:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
unfair point
 
02:23:34.630 --> 02:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
four the department can fulfill its
 
02:23:36.550 --> 02:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
public health and other responsibilities
 
02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
with almost the same degree of accuracy
 
02:23:41.910 --> 02:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
with this amendment assuming the 3%
 
02:23:45.710 --> 02:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
optout rate Five personal privacy is an
 
02:23:49.870 --> 02:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
important value in our state in 2018 80%
 
02:23:51.429 --> 02:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
of the people amended the State
 
02:23:54.389 --> 02:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
Constitution to provide that quote an
 
02:23:57.070 --> 02:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
individual's light right to live free
 
02:24:00.269 --> 02:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
from government intrusion in private or
 
02:24:02.510 --> 02:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
personal information is natural
 
02:24:06.590 --> 02:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent unquote six this
 
02:24:09.510 --> 02:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
bill implements that Amendment it's a
 
02:24:11.750 --> 02:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
determination by the general court
 
02:24:13.910 --> 02:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
balancing the state's need for personal
 
02:24:16.309 --> 02:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
information and citizens desires to
 
02:24:18.750 --> 02:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
maintain their privacy in that
 
02:24:21.790 --> 02:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
information seven an issue with the bill
 
02:24:23.190 --> 02:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
that is that it doesn't set out the
 
02:24:25.710 --> 02:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
specifics of the written notice in my
 
02:24:28.070 --> 02:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
experience the department has a dismal
 
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
history 20 more seconds if I may a
 
02:24:33.309 --> 02:24:33.319 align:start position:0%
dismal history of dealing with
 
02:24:35.710 --> 02:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
legislative required notices its
 
02:24:37.309 --> 02:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
practice is to make the notice too
 
02:24:39.309 --> 02:24:39.319 align:start position:0%
complex for a reasonable person to
 
02:24:41.309 --> 02:24:41.319 align:start position:0%
understand to make it so lengthy that no
 
02:24:42.870 --> 02:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
one will take the time to read it let
 
02:24:45.429 --> 02:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
alone understand it and three to bury
 
02:24:47.429 --> 02:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
the notice in a sheath of papers so that
 
02:24:49.030 --> 02:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
no one will ever see it let alone read
 
02:24:51.750 --> 02:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
it I have proposed amendment which deals
 
02:24:53.230 --> 02:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
with these issues and I will submit it
 
02:24:55.510 --> 02:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
to the chairman thank you Mr chairman
 
02:24:57.190 --> 02:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
that completes my testimony and I'd be
 
02:24:58.790 --> 02:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
pleased to answer any questions if there
 
02:25:02.910 --> 02:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
are any okay thank you representative
 
02:25:06.389 --> 02:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
Weber I got to number seven as being the
 
02:25:09.269 --> 02:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
department should um the bill should set
 
02:25:12.630 --> 02:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
out specific notice um I think I have
 
02:25:14.950 --> 02:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
lost number
 
02:25:17.550 --> 02:25:17.560 align:start position:0%
eight oh I have an amendment that deals
 
02:25:18.910 --> 02:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:25:21.510 --> 02:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
issue okay and I will present that to
 
02:25:23.150 --> 02:25:23.160 align:start position:0%

else representative CLE ring and then
 
02:26:13.870 --> 02:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
representative mlan thank you Mr chair
 
02:26:15.630 --> 02:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
so I I want some clarification if you
 
02:26:17.269 --> 02:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
can help me with understand this so I'm
 
02:26:18.750 --> 02:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
looking at this birth sheet I'm hearing
 
02:26:19.950 --> 02:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
from the Departments and different
 
02:26:22.070 --> 02:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
things that that there is the ability to
 
02:26:23.950 --> 02:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
opt out but I don't see it anywhere
 
02:26:25.990 --> 02:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
listed on this form that you can opt out
 
02:26:27.550 --> 02:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
of any of this information so could you
 
02:26:29.630 --> 02:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
clarify that a little bit based on your
 
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
testimony there is no specific provision
 
02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
in law or on the form to allow you to
 
02:26:37.309 --> 02:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
opt out but human beings sometimes
 
02:26:40.150 --> 02:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
refuse to provide information in that
 
02:26:42.710 --> 02:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
case there is a provision in in on the
 
02:26:44.870 --> 02:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
form as to how that information will be
 
02:26:47.269 --> 02:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
provided and by whom if the information
 
02:26:49.590 --> 02:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
is available from another source so a
 
02:26:51.750 --> 02:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
mother who refuses to provide
 
02:26:54.630 --> 02:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
information um does not know that the
 
02:26:56.469 --> 02:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
information will be provided from this
 
02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
other source and she may leave the
 
02:27:01.389 --> 02:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
hospital thinking I protected my privacy
 
02:27:04.429 --> 02:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
but in fact she hasn't does that answer
 
02:27:06.429 --> 02:27:06.439 align:start position:0%
the question or did I miss something
 
02:27:08.510 --> 02:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I guess to extent to that
 
02:27:10.110 --> 02:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
is there any other Provisions in the law
 
02:27:12.630 --> 02:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
that you know of that would basically
 
02:27:14.269 --> 02:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
make it to the hospital adding that
 
02:27:17.070 --> 02:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
information would be against the
 
02:27:20.790 --> 02:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
law no um I could see a law suit on the
 
02:27:22.510 --> 02:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
basis of the Constitutional privacy
 
02:27:24.429 --> 02:27:24.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment if that information were added
 
02:27:27.469 --> 02:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
but there's no statutory provision the
 
02:27:29.710 --> 02:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
the problem with with this information
 
02:27:31.830 --> 02:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
with this situation is that uh the
 
02:27:33.910 --> 02:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
department can deal with this even if
 
02:27:35.870 --> 02:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
there's no criminal penalty as was
 
02:27:37.469 --> 02:27:37.479 align:start position:0%
stated by the department there used to
 
02:27:39.309 --> 02:27:39.319 align:start position:0%
be a used to be a felony to provide the
 
02:27:41.309 --> 02:27:41.319 align:start position:0%
information to refuse to provide the
 
02:27:44.550 --> 02:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
information that is eliminated now so
 
02:27:47.469 --> 02:27:47.479 align:start position:0%
women uh May refuse to provide it but
 
02:27:49.790 --> 02:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
they don't realize that it's going to be
 
02:27:52.110 --> 02:27:52.120 align:start position:0%
provided on that form and distributed
 
02:27:55.510 --> 02:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
however based on other sources so it's
 
02:27:57.710 --> 02:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
somewhat misleading there is no
 
02:27:59.990 --> 02:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
statutory provision for an opt out this
 
02:28:02.269 --> 02:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
bill provides it that's the purpose of
 
02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
the Bill thank you representative
 
02:28:09.150 --> 02:28:09.160 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:28:11.110 --> 02:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I remember
 
02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
working with you on that Constitutional
 
02:28:16.990 --> 02:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment so um but with respect to some
 
02:28:19.389 --> 02:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
of the concerns that were raised about
 
02:28:23.070 --> 02:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
the the linkage of the mother and the
 
02:28:28.389 --> 02:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
child and also recognizing your concern
 
02:28:31.030 --> 02:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
about the fact that the woman thinks
 
02:28:33.349 --> 02:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
she's not providing the information not
 
02:28:37.230 --> 02:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
realizing that another source is would a
 
02:28:42.150 --> 02:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
better approach not possibly be um to
 
02:28:44.790 --> 02:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
have this final birth sheet which the
 
02:28:48.030 --> 02:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
mother may not see um have to have that
 
02:28:50.910 --> 02:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
authorized you know and you know provide
 
02:28:52.870 --> 02:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
some clarity because she's not seeing
 
02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
the finished document would that not be
 
02:28:59.550 --> 02:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
a better approach um because because I'm
 
02:29:01.630 --> 02:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
not so worried about I am concerned
 
02:29:03.910 --> 02:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
about the linkage but I'm also concerned
 
02:29:06.750 --> 02:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
about you know the fact that this is
 
02:29:08.429 --> 02:29:08.439 align:start position:0%
information coming from another source
 
02:29:10.110 --> 02:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't know about it and I just
 
02:29:12.750 --> 02:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
don't know how how anything we've heard
 
02:29:14.429 --> 02:29:14.439 align:start position:0%
bridges that
 
02:29:17.070 --> 02:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
Gap I think that would be an improvement
 
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
but I don't think it really solves the
 
02:29:21.269 --> 02:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
problem on its own you'd have to do some
 
02:29:26.230 --> 02:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:29.550 --> 02:29:29.560 align:start position:0%
um the the department seems to think
 
02:29:31.790 --> 02:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
that it should have this information
 
02:29:33.990 --> 02:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
because it is doing God's work and in
 
02:29:35.429 --> 02:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
some respects it
 
02:29:38.670 --> 02:29:38.680 align:start position:0%
is but the real responsibility for one's
 
02:29:41.710 --> 02:29:41.720 align:start position:0%
health is oneself and one's Health Care
 
02:29:44.469 --> 02:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
Providers not the department you heard
 
02:29:46.750 --> 02:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that the department uh on
 
02:29:48.590 --> 02:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
newor screenings was getting all of this
 
02:29:51.190 --> 02:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
information and it went to the provider
 
02:29:53.309 --> 02:29:53.319 align:start position:0%
and it's the provider and the mother who
 
02:29:55.590 --> 02:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
need to decide what to do it's nice that
 
02:29:57.349 --> 02:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
there's a back stop that the department
 
02:29:59.710 --> 02:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
provides but the primary responsibility
 
02:30:02.269 --> 02:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
for our Medical Care is ourselves and
 
02:30:03.830 --> 02:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
our provider not the Department of
 
02:30:06.110 --> 02:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services the department
 
02:30:08.429 --> 02:30:08.439 align:start position:0%
wants this information to fulfill what
 
02:30:10.950 --> 02:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
it considers to be important obligations
 
02:30:11.870 --> 02:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
and they
 
02:30:14.269 --> 02:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
are but there's a balance that has to be
 
02:30:17.510 --> 02:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
struck this bill is a small step in the
 
02:30:21.190 --> 02:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
direction of writing that balance um I
 
02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
take your points I think they could well
 
02:30:25.550 --> 02:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
be added to this bill as an improvement
 
02:30:27.590 --> 02:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
but I still think the basic fact that a
 
02:30:31.750 --> 02:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
woman can opt out now should be known to
 
02:30:33.870 --> 02:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
women and not just based on the few who
 
02:30:36.830 --> 02:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
say I won't give you information I think
 
02:30:39.590 --> 02:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
all women are entitled to know what they
 
02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
have a right to
 
02:30:45.150 --> 02:30:45.160 align:start position:0%
do any final
 
02:30:47.630 --> 02:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
questions saying none okay thank you
 
02:30:50.950 --> 02:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:30:52.950 --> 02:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh the hour is noon and we still have a
 
02:30:55.110 --> 02:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
few more folks to testify on this bill
 
02:30:57.429 --> 02:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
and then another one actually three more
 
02:30:59.070 --> 02:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
before the day is over so in order to
 
02:31:01.790 --> 02:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
keep on schedule as closely as possible
 
02:31:03.230 --> 02:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to once again to our rolling
 
02:31:05.150 --> 02:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
lunch and members are invited to go to
 
02:31:06.870 --> 02:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
lunch at their convenience so that we
 
02:31:08.910 --> 02:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
can try to stay as close to our en time

have about the vital record collection
 
02:32:11.510 --> 02:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
process um dealing with this bill I know
 
02:32:13.349 --> 02:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
that you are not the finance committee
 
02:32:14.910 --> 02:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
but I just want to let you know that we
 
02:32:17.349 --> 02:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
have had discussions with the sponsor of
 
02:32:19.870 --> 02:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
the legislation as he mentioned and
 
02:32:22.349 --> 02:32:22.359 align:start position:0%
depending on how the amendment um comes
 
02:32:25.230 --> 02:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
out there may be additional um cost to
 
02:32:27.110 --> 02:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation for our department
 
02:32:31.150 --> 02:32:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:33.550 --> 02:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
changes and thank you my name is Kristen
 
02:32:35.550 --> 02:32:35.560 align:start position:0%
Martino former Le keniston and I am the
 
02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
state registar and director of Vital
 
02:32:39.070 --> 02:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
Records um I just wanted to let you know
 
02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
that we are taking a neutral stance on
 
02:32:42.990 --> 02:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
this but I wanted to provide some um
 
02:32:46.030 --> 02:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
important information on some of the um
 
02:32:47.870 --> 02:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
consequences and potential
 
02:32:49.510 --> 02:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
contradictions with some statutes just
 
02:32:51.510 --> 02:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
so that we can be clear um so first of
 
02:32:53.269 --> 02:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
all we have no concern with providing
 
02:32:54.910 --> 02:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
the birth mother with any information
 
02:32:56.510 --> 02:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
just letting her know that this is what
 
02:32:58.349 --> 02:32:58.359 align:start position:0%
happens with your health information we
 
02:32:59.910 --> 02:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
are happy to work with the Department of
 
02:33:01.590 --> 02:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services to draft up a
 
02:33:03.510 --> 02:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
document such as that from an
 
02:33:05.269 --> 02:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
operational standpoint we have no
 
02:33:07.590 --> 02:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
concern with adding an opt out feature
 
02:33:08.990 --> 02:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
both to the birth worksheets that would
 
02:33:10.750 --> 02:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
be checked off and signed by the mother
 
02:33:13.469 --> 02:33:13.479 align:start position:0%
and then into our data collection system
 
02:33:15.150 --> 02:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
so if you hear me refer to something as
 
02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
Nan nean is our data collection system
 
02:33:18.910 --> 02:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
that's the software that we use for all
 
02:33:20.230 --> 02:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
vital records in the State of New
 
02:33:22.030 --> 02:33:22.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so you you hear me use never
 
02:33:24.990 --> 02:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
and that's what that is um so we
 
02:33:26.950 --> 02:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
respectfully request um that a
 
02:33:28.750 --> 02:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
definition of personal identifiers be
 
02:33:29.990 --> 02:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
provided which I know we've already
 
02:33:32.070 --> 02:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
touched on um with representative Bolton
 
02:33:34.110 --> 02:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
and others have stated that we do need
 
02:33:35.429 --> 02:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
that to be very clear within our
 
02:33:37.550 --> 02:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
statutes we don't have administrative
 
02:33:40.269 --> 02:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
rules we follow the the statutes and so
 
02:33:41.590 --> 02:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
therefore we need them to be very clear
 
02:33:43.630 --> 02:33:43.640 align:start position:0%
and concise when we're following
 
02:33:45.830 --> 02:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
them um there are some possible
 
02:33:47.710 --> 02:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
contradictions and the unintended
 
02:33:50.429 --> 02:33:50.439 align:start position:0%
consequences so by limiting the
 
02:33:52.030 --> 02:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
disclosure of information you should be
 
02:33:55.070 --> 02:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
aware that it might contradict RSA 5c4
 
02:33:57.349 --> 02:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 2 and 3 the handout that
 
02:33:59.030 --> 02:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
just came around I've highlighted the
 
02:34:00.950 --> 02:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
areas that there could be a potential
 
02:34:02.750 --> 02:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
contradiction so I won't go into it too
 
02:34:04.710 --> 02:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
in depth but essentially there are
 
02:34:06.429 --> 02:34:06.439 align:start position:0%
existing statutes that say that the
 
02:34:07.990 --> 02:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:34:09.870 --> 02:34:09.880 align:start position:0%
does have direct intangible interests to
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
all of our records and then that Co um
 
02:34:14.990 --> 02:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
that pulls in on their statute which
 
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
says that they should have 24/7 access
 
02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
to our information so um by having
 
02:34:20.830 --> 02:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
something that says we can't give that
 
02:34:22.269 --> 02:34:22.279 align:start position:0%
information but then something that says
 
02:34:23.790 --> 02:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
we should be giving that information
 
02:34:25.469 --> 02:34:25.479 align:start position:0%
could potentially create a
 
02:34:27.510 --> 02:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
contradiction um and then just to touch
 
02:34:29.349 --> 02:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
base on the birth registration process
 
02:34:31.309 --> 02:34:31.319 align:start position:0%
is it leads to my next concern with a
 
02:34:33.510 --> 02:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
possible contradiction um after
 
02:34:34.510 --> 02:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
everything is collected on these
 
02:34:36.670 --> 02:34:36.680 align:start position:0%
worksheets the worksheet is given to a
 
02:34:38.510 --> 02:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
birth registar at the hospital that
 
02:34:40.750 --> 02:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
birth registar is uh has been vetted and
 
02:34:42.590 --> 02:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
is accessed to our system to enter the
 
02:34:45.070 --> 02:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
record into nean and they go through and
 
02:34:46.830 --> 02:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
they enter all of the information on
 
02:34:49.309 --> 02:34:49.319 align:start position:0%
everything never is used to not only
 
02:34:51.309 --> 02:34:51.319 align:start position:0%
create the birth certificate for the
 
02:34:53.590 --> 02:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
child but to also collect all of that
 
02:34:55.389 --> 02:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
statistical information and then
 
02:34:56.790 --> 02:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
disseminate it as it should be
 
02:34:58.429 --> 02:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
disseminated whether it's to the federal
 
02:35:04.269 --> 02:35:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:07.830 --> 02:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
DHHS and then from there once it's in
 
02:35:10.590 --> 02:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
the system and we have it it's the
 
02:35:12.670 --> 02:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
division that actually gives that
 
02:35:14.030 --> 02:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
information to the dep Department of
 
02:35:16.349 --> 02:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services the one of the
 
02:35:18.110 --> 02:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
things that I'm concerned with with the
 
02:35:19.710 --> 02:35:19.720 align:start position:0%
way that this current language is
 
02:35:22.190 --> 02:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
written it has removed the onus from the
 
02:35:23.870 --> 02:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
division of Vital Records to submit the
 
02:35:25.429 --> 02:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
information to the Department of Health
 
02:35:27.070 --> 02:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and now has put it on
 
02:35:28.510 --> 02:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
the hospital it's saying that the
 
02:35:29.670 --> 02:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
hospital is going to redact this
 
02:35:31.429 --> 02:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
information before it goes to
 
02:35:34.590 --> 02:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
DHHS um the what that contradicts with
 
02:35:36.670 --> 02:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
is 5c4 which is my duties as a state
 
02:35:38.790 --> 02:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
regist which allows me to set up this
 
02:35:40.590 --> 02:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
never system and also how our
 
02:35:42.230 --> 02:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
information is not only registered but
 
02:35:44.910 --> 02:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
collected and then disseminated so that
 
02:35:47.150 --> 02:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be looked at and addressed um
 
02:35:48.870 --> 02:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
it it's almost as though it removes us
 
02:35:51.150 --> 02:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
from the entire registration process I
 
02:35:52.630 --> 02:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
know that wasn't the intent of the bill
 
02:35:54.429 --> 02:35:54.439 align:start position:0%
and speaking with the sponsor but when I
 
02:35:56.190 --> 02:35:56.200 align:start position:0%
gave this bill to my staff to review
 
02:35:57.750 --> 02:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
they even shared that concern they they
 
02:35:59.349 --> 02:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
were nervous that it meant the hospital
 
02:36:01.389 --> 02:36:01.399 align:start position:0%
couldn't even put the information into
 
02:36:03.309 --> 02:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
our system so we just respectfully
 
02:36:05.349 --> 02:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
request that that is looked at and and
 
02:36:08.349 --> 02:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
possibly revised um and then on a final
 
02:36:10.269 --> 02:36:10.279 align:start position:0%
note just um to make sure that the
 
02:36:12.630 --> 02:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
effective date it we're given 60 days we
 
02:36:14.030 --> 02:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
would we would like to see that maybe up
 
02:36:16.389 --> 02:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
to 120 days to comply that just gives us
 
02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
more time to make our software changes
 
02:36:21.510 --> 02:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
and to reprint work as needed so I try
 
02:36:22.870 --> 02:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
to move through that as quick as I could
 
02:36:24.630 --> 02:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
for you if you have any questions let me
 
02:36:27.630 --> 02:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
know you have 5 Seconds to
 
02:36:31.269 --> 02:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:33.230 --> 02:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
questions and you covered it so well
 
02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
there aren't even any questions very
 
02:36:34.840 --> 02:36:41.269 align:start position:0%
there aren't even any questions very
good

02:36:41.269 --> 02:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:43.670 --> 02:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
excellent also signed up to speak is
 
02:37:04.190 --> 02:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:05.830 --> 02:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
hi there for the record uh Courtney
 
02:37:07.429 --> 02:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
Tanner from I'm the senior director of
 
02:37:09.950 --> 02:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
government relations at Dartmouth H um
 
02:37:12.110 --> 02:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
and um I was G to say move the micophone
 
02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
of course uh we have concerns with the
 
02:37:17.389 --> 02:37:17.399 align:start position:0%
bill as drafted um as has been stated
 
02:37:19.070 --> 02:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
there's another bill Senate Bill 92
 
02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's that will likely be crossing over
 
02:37:23.190 --> 02:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
to this body that we um have been
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
working on and would like to continue
 
02:37:27.750 --> 02:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
work to work on with this committee um
 
02:37:29.830 --> 02:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
some of our concerns are stated in the
 
02:37:32.429 --> 02:37:32.439 align:start position:0%
written testimony that I submitted uh
 
02:37:35.710 --> 02:37:35.720 align:start position:0%
and is being passed around from um one
 
02:37:38.950 --> 02:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
of our providers Daisy Goodman who um is
 
02:37:42.510 --> 02:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
the recipient of um does a lot of work
 
02:37:45.510 --> 02:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
does Direct Care work with um women who
 
02:37:48.030 --> 02:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
are navigating substance use uh
 
02:37:51.910 --> 02:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
disorders and other health challenges um
 
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
and Daisy also is doing a lot of
 
02:37:56.750 --> 02:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
extensive work in our rural communities
 
02:37:58.950 --> 02:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
and has concerns that if this bill moves
 
02:38:01.950 --> 02:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
forward as introduced that a lot of the
 
02:38:03.750 --> 02:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
um work that we're doing to understand
 
02:38:05.670 --> 02:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
the maternal Health needs in our state
 
02:38:07.710 --> 02:38:07.720 align:start position:0%
will have to fall away because we won't
 
02:38:10.469 --> 02:38:10.479 align:start position:0%
be able to um track and and understand
 
02:38:12.349 --> 02:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
where the areas of opportunity for
 
02:38:15.830 --> 02:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
improvement are um as introduced
 
02:38:17.349 --> 02:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
questions some of the questions that I
 
02:38:19.710 --> 02:38:19.720 align:start position:0%
have around the bill are um which
 
02:38:22.590 --> 02:38:22.600 align:start position:0%
personal identifiers questions around
 
02:38:24.190 --> 02:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
what information needs to be kept in the
 
02:38:26.870 --> 02:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
medical record I'm very concerned about
 
02:38:28.710 --> 02:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
requirements for us to enter any
 
02:38:30.230 --> 02:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
information into our medical record
 
02:38:31.230 --> 02:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
because not only is that an
 
02:38:32.910 --> 02:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
administrative burden but a medical
 
02:38:35.910 --> 02:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
record is a um technical uh record that
 
02:38:39.070 --> 02:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
needs to be um we need to keep really
 
02:38:41.830 --> 02:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
careful uh information in there and so
 
02:38:44.990 --> 02:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
um opting out is an is uh just what
 
02:38:46.469 --> 02:38:46.479 align:start position:0%
would need to be kept in the medical
 
02:38:49.150 --> 02:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
record would be a question um and then
 
02:38:50.510 --> 02:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
question questions around you know what
 
02:38:52.230 --> 02:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
is the minimal amount of statistical
 
02:38:54.349 --> 02:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
information you've heard that testimony
 
02:38:56.070 --> 02:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
before this this morning now we're in
 
02:38:58.030 --> 02:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
the afternoon and would have those same
 
02:39:00.309 --> 02:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
questions and concerns the only other
 
02:39:01.630 --> 02:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
point I would raise up as you know
 
02:39:04.309 --> 02:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth health is is a system um one
 
02:39:06.190 --> 02:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
of our system members is chesher Medical
 
02:39:08.750 --> 02:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
Center and that is a um Medicare
 
02:39:13.070 --> 02:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
designated health uh Health hospital and
 
02:39:15.830 --> 02:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
we receive an enhanced Medica Medicare
 
02:39:18.269 --> 02:39:18.279 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate because of it because
 
02:39:20.309 --> 02:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
of its rural designation
 
02:39:22.750 --> 02:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
and when we're not able to track our
 
02:39:24.389 --> 02:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
maternal health and health Improvement
 
02:39:27.469 --> 02:39:27.479 align:start position:0%
Trends in the state um we are at risk of
 
02:39:29.910 --> 02:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
losing that designation here um in New
 
02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so that's a really
 
02:39:33.469 --> 02:39:33.479 align:start position:0%
important um designation so that we can
 
02:39:34.830 --> 02:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
ensure that there's access to care in
 
02:39:36.030 --> 02:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
our rural
 
02:39:38.550 --> 02:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
communities um I'm happy to answer
 
02:39:39.910 --> 02:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
questions I know you've heard a lot of
 
02:39:42.790 --> 02:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill today thank you
 
02:39:45.590 --> 02:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
any questions representative Kastle ring
 
02:39:46.990 --> 02:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just have one
 
02:39:48.510 --> 02:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
question it was specifically said in
 
02:39:51.349 --> 02:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
another statement that um the facilities
 
02:39:53.349 --> 02:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
can add more information that was not
 
02:39:56.070 --> 02:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
provided by the the mother um is that a
 
02:39:58.030 --> 02:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
practice of any of the Dartmouth Health
 
02:39:59.670 --> 02:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
Systems to add any information that's
 
02:40:01.349 --> 02:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
not provide or that's not provided by
 
02:40:06.590 --> 02:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
the birth mother um no I think I uh we
 
02:40:07.830 --> 02:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
would have to make sure that we're
 
02:40:09.269 --> 02:40:09.279 align:start position:0%
following the letter of the law very
 
02:40:11.230 --> 02:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
strictly and we would there would not be
 
02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
additional information added that's
 
02:40:16.710 --> 02:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
outside of the state and federal laws so
 
02:40:18.269 --> 02:40:18.279 align:start position:0%
patient privacy is something that we
 
02:40:20.469 --> 02:40:20.479 align:start position:0%
take very seriously and we want to make
 
02:40:22.389 --> 02:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
sure we're in compliance with state and
 
02:40:25.030 --> 02:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
federal regulation so as a follow-up
 
02:40:27.590 --> 02:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
question there to to very Point andly
 
02:40:31.070 --> 02:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
say this yeah there's nothing that is
 
02:40:33.150 --> 02:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
added not outside state and federal
 
02:40:34.750 --> 02:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
regulation but I mean there might be
 
02:40:36.590 --> 02:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
information added though some specific
 
02:40:39.349 --> 02:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
information but at at all there's you
 
02:40:41.389 --> 02:40:41.399 align:start position:0%
know you said within the law but is
 
02:40:42.710 --> 02:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
there anything that could be added
 
02:40:43.550 --> 02:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
within the
 
02:40:47.389 --> 02:40:47.399 align:start position:0%
law I I would have to come Circle back
 
02:40:49.790 --> 02:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
with you but again strict clients with
 
02:40:51.469 --> 02:40:51.479 align:start position:0%
state and federal regulation in terms of
 
02:40:53.710 --> 02:40:53.720 align:start position:0%
what information needs to be added and
 
02:40:55.710 --> 02:40:55.720 align:start position:0%
also that we're balancing that patient
 
02:40:58.110 --> 02:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
privacy that's the that's a question for
 
02:41:00.070 --> 02:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
my general
 
02:41:07.349 --> 02:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
M thank you Mr
 
02:41:12.990 --> 02:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
chairman would you tell us Professor
 
02:41:15.750 --> 02:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
Goodman what all those initials mean
 
02:41:18.990 --> 02:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
after your name as I think it deals with
 
02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:20.429 align:start position:0%
after your name as I think it deals with
your

02:41:20.429 --> 02:41:20.439 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:41:22.750 --> 02:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
excessive credibility yeah well Daisy is
 
02:41:25.670 --> 02:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
a certified nurse Midwife she also is a
 
02:41:28.389 --> 02:41:28.399 align:start position:0%
doctorate in nursing she has a masters
 
02:41:30.349 --> 02:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
in public health and she's a
 
02:41:34.469 --> 02:41:34.479 align:start position:0%
board-certified um uh nurse practitioner
 
02:41:36.389 --> 02:41:36.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Daisy also is our vice chair
 
02:41:39.550 --> 02:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
of our OB GYN department and so she does
 
02:41:43.030 --> 02:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
extensive research um and has an holds a
 
02:41:44.830 --> 02:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
number of federal grants one of which is
 
02:41:49.349 --> 02:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
a an arm mom's Grant which is looking to
 
02:41:52.389 --> 02:41:52.399 align:start position:0%
expand our ability to provide obstetric
 
02:41:55.230 --> 02:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
services to the North Country uh and
 
02:41:56.510 --> 02:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
because as we know we're navigating
 
02:41:59.469 --> 02:41:59.479 align:start position:0%
maternal Health desert so um we would be
 
02:42:02.150 --> 02:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
concerned about our ability to keep
 
02:42:03.469 --> 02:42:03.479 align:start position:0%
those federal funds here in New
 
02:42:06.590 --> 02:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if we if some of those um some
 
02:42:10.230 --> 02:42:10.240 align:start position:0%

DHHS and we're here this afternoon to
 
02:51:35.790 --> 02:51:35.800 align:start position:0%
oppose House Bill 636 so this
 
02:51:38.269 --> 02:51:38.279 align:start position:0%
legislation would allow Community Mental
 
02:51:40.429 --> 02:51:40.439 align:start position:0%
Health Providers to receive the same
 
02:51:42.590 --> 02:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
rate of reimbursement as community
 
02:51:44.790 --> 02:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
mental health programs so you will hear
 
02:51:46.510 --> 02:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
those two different words back and forth
 
02:51:48.590 --> 02:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
in my testimony I just want to clarify
 
02:51:52.670 --> 02:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
for you this afternoon um that the this
 
02:51:55.870 --> 02:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
legislation has a change to the the
 
02:51:57.590 --> 02:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
definition of community mental health
 
02:52:00.670 --> 02:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
programs and today um the department
 
02:52:02.469 --> 02:52:02.479 align:start position:0%
provides critical quality of care
 
02:52:04.469 --> 02:52:04.479 align:start position:0%
oversight of community mental health
 
02:52:06.710 --> 02:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
programs as outlined in both our
 
02:52:08.630 --> 02:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
administrative Rule and through our
 
02:52:11.269 --> 02:52:11.279 align:start position:0%
Contracting and there are currently 10
 
02:52:13.750 --> 02:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers who meet
 
02:52:15.910 --> 02:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
the term of community mental health
 
02:52:18.510 --> 02:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
program um these are reviewed through
 
02:52:20.950 --> 02:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
through a designation process every 5
 
02:52:23.790 --> 02:52:23.800 align:start position:0%
years and are monitored through ongoing
 
02:52:25.790 --> 02:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh contract oversight and Community
 
02:52:28.910 --> 02:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Providers that second word
 
02:52:30.710 --> 02:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
that was is within the legislation that
 
02:52:32.790 --> 02:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
makes a little bit of confusion here are
 
02:52:34.710 --> 02:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
not subject to these high levels of
 
02:52:36.990 --> 02:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
regulatory and quality oversight to
 
02:52:39.349 --> 02:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
deliver services to individuals that are
 
02:52:42.309 --> 02:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with severe mental illness or
 
02:52:45.229 --> 02:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
severe emotional dist disturbance so the
 
02:52:47.389 --> 02:52:47.399 align:start position:0%
high level of monitoring and oversight
 
02:52:49.070 --> 02:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
standards that are required Ed of
 
02:52:51.630 --> 02:52:51.640 align:start position:0%
community mental health programs ensure
 
02:52:53.750 --> 02:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
that this population receives
 
02:52:55.510 --> 02:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
highquality services that are tailored
 
02:52:58.309 --> 02:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
to meet their unique treatment needs so
 
02:53:00.190 --> 02:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
this legislation could result in those
 
02:53:01.830 --> 02:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
individuals that are diagnosed with
 
02:53:03.269 --> 02:53:03.279 align:start position:0%
severe mental illness or severe
 
02:53:05.150 --> 02:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
emotional disturbance disturbance that
 
02:53:07.190 --> 02:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
are accessing supports and services from
 
02:53:09.110 --> 02:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
community mental health programs to
 
02:53:11.030 --> 02:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
actually being able to access Services
 
02:53:12.630 --> 02:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
through other types of community mental
 
02:53:14.309 --> 02:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
health providers for treatment which
 
02:53:16.349 --> 02:53:16.359 align:start position:0%
could impact their quality of
 
02:53:19.229 --> 02:53:19.239 align:start position:0%
care there are significant concerns that
 
02:53:21.070 --> 02:53:21.080 align:start position:0%
without consistent oversight the
 
02:53:22.750 --> 02:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
department will be unable to guarantee
 
02:53:24.670 --> 02:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
safe and effective treatment provided to
 
02:53:26.150 --> 02:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
children youth adults and families that
 
02:53:28.190 --> 02:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
are receiving intensive mental health
 
02:53:31.190 --> 02:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
and substance use Services um the
 
02:53:32.870 --> 02:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
department is assuming that the intent
 
02:53:35.510 --> 02:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
is to create additional provider types
 
02:53:38.349 --> 02:53:38.359 align:start position:0%
and to have them be able to access the
 
02:53:40.190 --> 02:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
enhanced rates that are set for these
 
02:53:42.550 --> 02:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
community mental health programs uh
 
02:53:44.670 --> 02:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
however those rates are set considering
 
02:53:46.670 --> 02:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
the unbillable services that are
 
02:53:49.190 --> 02:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
required by this provider type uh to
 
02:53:50.630 --> 02:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
implement their evidence-based best
 
02:53:52.590 --> 02:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
practices for the specialty population
 
02:53:54.710 --> 02:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
with severe mental illness or SE severe
 
02:53:57.070 --> 02:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
emotional disturbance and additionally
 
02:53:59.870 --> 02:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
more than half of services delivered by
 
02:54:02.150 --> 02:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
our community mental health programs are
 
02:54:04.790 --> 02:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
community- based and the delivery of
 
02:54:07.070 --> 02:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
those community- Based Services the high
 
02:54:10.349 --> 02:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
regulatory oversight requirements and
 
02:54:12.590 --> 02:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
the um requirements to serve all
 
02:54:15.150 --> 02:54:15.160 align:start position:0%
individuals who me who meet eligibility
 
02:54:18.590 --> 02:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
are in part the reasons for that unique
 
02:54:21.030 --> 02:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
provider specific rate schedule that's
 
02:54:24.670 --> 02:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
why those rates are enhanced um so that
 
02:54:26.870 --> 02:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
would not be true for the Community
 
02:54:28.910 --> 02:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
Mental Health provider so it's that
 
02:54:30.630 --> 02:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
difference again between program and
 
02:54:33.190 --> 02:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
provider um so to implement this
 
02:54:34.510 --> 02:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
legislation the department would need to
 
02:54:35.910 --> 02:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
undertake a thorough review of all of
 
02:54:37.190 --> 02:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
our administrative rules that are
 
02:54:38.630 --> 02:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
pertaining to the community mental
 
02:54:40.830 --> 02:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
health treatment and to evaluate our
 
02:54:42.910 --> 02:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
existing statutory authority to ensure
 
02:54:45.510 --> 02:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
that um it's in alignment with any of
 
02:54:47.710 --> 02:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
these legislative changes we believe
 
02:54:50.150 --> 02:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
there would be significant fiscal impact
 
02:54:52.870 --> 02:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
however we don't have oversight over the
 
02:54:55.429 --> 02:54:55.439 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Providers uh to
 
02:54:57.389 --> 02:54:57.399 align:start position:0%
have a sense of how many might be
 
02:54:58.990 --> 02:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
eligible for the enhanced rate or the
 
02:55:00.750 --> 02:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
number of people or services that they
 
02:55:05.830 --> 02:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
might offer so hard to determine that
 
02:55:07.990 --> 02:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
impact and the only other thing I would
 
02:55:09.630 --> 02:55:09.640 align:start position:0%
add from the Medicaid perspective is
 
02:55:12.070 --> 02:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
that um we believe this would have a
 
02:55:14.389 --> 02:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
material impact on the capitation rates
 
02:55:16.830 --> 02:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
in our MCO contracts because as as of
 
02:55:19.670 --> 02:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
now we pay providers based B on certain
 
02:55:21.790 --> 02:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
um we pay pay rates based on what
 
02:55:23.550 --> 02:55:23.560 align:start position:0%
they're qualified to do and this in
 
02:55:26.349 --> 02:55:26.359 align:start position:0%
essence would increase those providers
 
02:55:28.510 --> 02:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
from one section to another the higher
 
02:55:30.389 --> 02:55:30.399 align:start position:0%
rate uh which would have a material
 
02:55:32.790 --> 02:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
impact on the MCO contracts uh the
 
02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:36.229 align:start position:0%
impact on the MCO contracts uh the
capitation

02:55:36.229 --> 02:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:38.190 --> 02:55:38.200 align:start position:0%
rates so we're happy to take any
 
02:55:40.950 --> 02:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Lucas
 
02:55:42.790 --> 02:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry could you repeat that last
 
02:55:43.870 --> 02:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
point that you were making about
 
02:55:43.880 --> 02:55:45.429 align:start position:0%
point that you were making about
reimbursement

02:55:45.429 --> 02:55:45.439 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
02:55:48.950 --> 02:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
rates so our MCO contract
 
02:55:53.670 --> 02:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
we have um if we expanded the scope of
 
02:55:55.269 --> 02:55:55.279 align:start position:0%
providers that can be Community Mental
 
02:55:58.309 --> 02:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
Health Program providers that would in
 
02:56:01.269 --> 02:56:01.279 align:start position:0%
essence put them in a higher rate of pay
 
02:56:03.510 --> 02:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
which in turn increases the capitation
 
02:56:05.309 --> 02:56:05.319 align:start position:0%
rate and which would increase the cost
 
02:56:08.269 --> 02:56:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:11.150 --> 02:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
contracts thank you anyone else any
 
02:56:13.870 --> 02:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
other question representative Woods uh
 
02:56:15.309 --> 02:56:15.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for taking
 
02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
my question I um I I think I understand
 
02:56:22.349 --> 02:56:22.359 align:start position:0%
but uh would it um clarify if I have the
 
02:56:25.790 --> 02:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
wrong impression that if enough of the U
 
02:56:29.429 --> 02:56:29.439 align:start position:0%
uh providers were to sort of come into a
 
02:56:31.229 --> 02:56:31.239 align:start position:0%
particular area some of the mental
 
02:56:34.269 --> 02:56:34.279 align:start position:0%
health centers um into the area where
 
02:56:35.670 --> 02:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
there's Mental Health Center the
 
02:56:38.910 --> 02:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
providers would take the clientele
 
02:56:42.269 --> 02:56:42.279 align:start position:0%
away uh and therefore they wouldn't the
 
02:56:45.710 --> 02:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
centers wouldn't get as much sort of per
 
02:56:49.110 --> 02:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
um reimbursement um I'm I'm not sure how
 
02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:50.269 align:start position:0%
um reimbursement um I'm I'm not sure how
that

02:56:50.269 --> 02:56:50.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:56:52.990 --> 02:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
works so I think we we all want to have
 
02:56:55.229 --> 02:56:55.239 align:start position:0%
expanded Workforce and have many types
 
02:56:57.429 --> 02:56:57.439 align:start position:0%
of providers to for all of us to be able
 
02:56:59.670 --> 02:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
to access different types of on the
 
02:57:03.630 --> 02:57:03.640 align:start position:0%
center the the the problematic part is
 
02:57:05.870 --> 02:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
being is that the enhanced rate of the
 
02:57:09.150 --> 02:57:09.160 align:start position:0%
community mental health programs is
 
02:57:11.190 --> 02:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
there because of all of the unbillable
 
02:57:13.510 --> 02:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
Care it's there because of the of the
 
02:57:15.550 --> 02:57:15.560 align:start position:0%
way that they have enhanced services
 
02:57:17.389 --> 02:57:17.399 align:start position:0%
that they need to provide to all those
 
02:57:18.670 --> 02:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
that are eligible
 
02:57:20.269 --> 02:57:20.279 align:start position:0%
and other types of Community Mental
 
02:57:22.710 --> 02:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
Health Providers can and should be
 
02:57:25.910 --> 02:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
operating in the in any area of the
 
02:57:28.790 --> 02:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
state but they but the enhanced rate is
 
02:57:30.790 --> 02:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
set out specifically for that unique
 
02:57:32.590 --> 02:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
provider type that's a mental health
 
02:57:34.349 --> 02:57:34.359 align:start position:0%
program because of all the additional
 
02:57:36.710 --> 02:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
services that are offered so it's not so
 
02:57:38.790 --> 02:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
much that we that we don't want people
 
02:57:42.150 --> 02:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
accessing both but rather for for those
 
02:57:44.389 --> 02:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
who have severe and persistent mental
 
02:57:46.389 --> 02:57:46.399 align:start position:0%
illness or severe emotional disturb
 
02:57:48.630 --> 02:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
disturbance we wouldn't want them to be
 
02:57:50.830 --> 02:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
accessing care without the quality
 
02:57:53.429 --> 02:57:53.439 align:start position:0%
oversight or without the types of
 
02:57:55.429 --> 02:57:55.439 align:start position:0%
wraparound services and additional
 
02:57:57.910 --> 02:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
supports additionally one piece that I
 
02:57:59.830 --> 02:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
neglected to mention is the change from
 
02:58:02.309 --> 02:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
Psychiatric to psychological within this
 
02:58:04.550 --> 02:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
legislation and under our community
 
02:58:07.349 --> 02:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
mental health programs um that that
 
02:58:09.590 --> 02:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
medical or psych psychiatric screening
 
02:58:11.510 --> 02:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
and evaluation is critical to the
 
02:58:12.990 --> 02:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
current way that the the community
 
02:58:15.830 --> 02:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
mental health programs provide care and
 
02:58:17.710 --> 02:58:17.720 align:start position:0%
especially for that specialty population
 
02:58:17.720 --> 02:58:20.469 align:start position:0%
especially for that specialty population
mentioned

02:58:20.469 --> 02:58:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:23.349 --> 02:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
represent I'll representative hartnet
 
02:58:25.429 --> 02:58:25.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking the
 
02:58:28.590 --> 02:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
question uh that uh issue of psychology
 
02:58:31.670 --> 02:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
or psychologist versus Psychiatry uh
 
02:58:33.710 --> 02:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
this may be new content for some of the
 
02:58:35.070 --> 02:58:35.080 align:start position:0%
members can you explain what the
 
02:58:39.070 --> 02:58:39.080 align:start position:0%
difference would be on a at a street
 
02:58:42.190 --> 02:58:42.200 align:start position:0%
level so the re I mean it's in our
 
02:58:44.229 --> 02:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
current definition under our community
 
02:58:47.309 --> 02:58:47.319 align:start position:0%
mental health programs because we are
 
02:58:49.190 --> 02:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
serving the community mental health
 
02:58:50.870 --> 02:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
programs are specifically serving those
 
02:58:52.309 --> 02:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
with severe mental illness severe
 
02:58:53.590 --> 02:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
impersistent mental illness severe
 
02:58:55.630 --> 02:58:55.640 align:start position:0%
emotional disturbance and they may need
 
02:58:57.990 --> 02:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
psychiatric or medical care including
 
02:59:00.349 --> 02:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
oftentimes medications so there's a
 
02:59:02.510 --> 02:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
specific need to have that provider type
 
02:59:05.510 --> 02:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
and have folks be under Medical Care the
 
02:59:08.830 --> 02:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
change in psychological um we do want to
 
02:59:10.990 --> 02:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
again have psychologists operating in
 
02:59:12.830 --> 02:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
our communities of course and we're not
 
02:59:14.630 --> 02:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
looking to restrict that but under this
 
02:59:17.469 --> 02:59:17.479 align:start position:0%
program type um it is critical that it's
 
02:59:20.550 --> 02:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
that medical provider
 
02:59:24.750 --> 02:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
type it's about medicine yes
 
02:59:27.190 --> 02:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
yep anyone
 
02:59:30.510 --> 02:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
02:59:32.910 --> 02:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
McCay thank you Mr
 
02:59:32.920 --> 02:59:34.429 align:start position:0%
McCay thank you Mr
chairman

02:59:34.429 --> 02:59:34.439 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:59:38.349 --> 02:59:38.359 align:start position:0%
um uh I hardly know where to start with
 
02:59:42.229 --> 02:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
the on this bill but I was a licensed
 
02:59:44.790 --> 02:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
clinical social worker I was on the
 
02:59:48.349 --> 02:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
licensing board and I was in private
 
02:59:53.389 --> 02:59:53.399 align:start position:0%
practice for about 35 years which tells
 
02:59:57.309 --> 02:59:57.319 align:start position:0%
you something about my age probably uh
 
02:59:59.830 --> 02:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about this bill because I
 
03:00:02.269 --> 03:00:02.279 align:start position:0%
don't understand what it's supposed to
 
03:00:08.670 --> 03:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
do uh it sounds as if uh that somebody
 
03:00:12.190 --> 03:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
could be in private practice which this
 
03:00:15.070 --> 03:00:15.080 align:start position:0%
this bill provides services
 
03:00:17.550 --> 03:00:17.560 align:start position:0%
independently I think that maybe means
 
03:00:21.389 --> 03:00:21.399 align:start position:0%
private practice and if it does are they
 
03:00:24.469 --> 03:00:24.479 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that without being
 
03:00:27.229 --> 03:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
licensed so I do still believe this
 
03:00:30.349 --> 03:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
would fall under the regul licensing
 
03:00:33.110 --> 03:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
under oplc that folks would be licensed
 
03:00:35.349 --> 03:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
it's more about the rates as far as I
 
03:00:37.190 --> 03:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
can tell from the this piece of
 
03:00:40.150 --> 03:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
legislation is that people are currently
 
03:00:43.030 --> 03:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
if you're a Medicaid provider um you can
 
03:00:46.710 --> 03:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
Bill Medicaid for these services at um
 
03:00:48.790 --> 03:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
the standard rate and that there are
 
03:00:51.750 --> 03:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
separate unique rates for our community
 
03:00:54.710 --> 03:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
mental health programs based on the high
 
03:00:56.870 --> 03:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
quality oversight and the additional
 
03:00:59.110 --> 03:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
unbillable services and the requirement
 
03:01:02.110 --> 03:01:02.120 align:start position:0%
to serve all who are eligible follow
 
03:01:02.120 --> 03:01:04.030 align:start position:0%
to serve all who are eligible follow
follow

03:01:04.030 --> 03:01:04.040 align:start position:0%
follow
 
03:01:07.630 --> 03:01:07.640 align:start position:0%
up does that mean that
 
03:01:10.190 --> 03:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
non-licensed practitioners can be in
 
03:01:13.590 --> 03:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
private practice no I do not believe so
 
03:01:17.389 --> 03:01:17.399 align:start position:0%
that that's very important I agree thank
 
03:01:19.870 --> 03:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
you any representative
 
03:01:22.110 --> 03:01:22.120 align:start position:0%
haret thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
03:01:25.469 --> 03:01:25.479 align:start position:0%
taking this question too um uh I'm uh
 
03:01:27.190 --> 03:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
familiar with at least three Mental
 
03:01:30.030 --> 03:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
Health Centers and uh over the past say
 
03:01:32.030 --> 03:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
half dozen years there struggles in
 
03:01:35.990 --> 03:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
recruitment of Staff um are you aware of
 
03:01:39.670 --> 03:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
any Grand influx of psychiatric social
 
03:01:42.070 --> 03:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
workers counselors into the state that
 
03:01:45.990 --> 03:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
would uh make this kind of initiative uh
 
03:01:48.510 --> 03:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
a possibility a successful Poss
 
03:01:51.190 --> 03:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
ability boy do I wish I could say yes we
 
03:01:54.269 --> 03:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
had an influx of providers uh no I do
 
03:01:56.190 --> 03:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
not think we have an influx of providers
 
03:01:58.389 --> 03:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
we certainly are doing a lot of work on
 
03:01:59.990 --> 03:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development and Behavioral
 
03:02:03.910 --> 03:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
Health um and I I I think there's this
 
03:02:07.550 --> 03:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
is specifically about a need for
 
03:02:11.870 --> 03:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
probably uh additional rates for those
 
03:02:13.710 --> 03:02:13.720 align:start position:0%
practicing in the community I we're
 
03:02:15.110 --> 03:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
making a lot of assumptions because I'm
 
03:02:16.830 --> 03:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
not sure of the intent of the
 
03:02:18.750 --> 03:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
legislation and if we able to better
 
03:02:20.630 --> 03:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
better understand that we may be able to
 
03:02:23.910 --> 03:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
work on what would need to to happen but
 
03:02:27.110 --> 03:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
we don't think that it is an editing the
 
03:02:29.190 --> 03:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
current definitions of the community
 
03:02:32.070 --> 03:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
mental health programs followup just a
 
03:02:34.309 --> 03:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
clarifying question then so you don't
 
03:02:35.750 --> 03:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
know where the heck the workforce would
 
03:02:35.760 --> 03:02:36.830 align:start position:0%
know where the heck the workforce would
come

03:02:36.830 --> 03:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
come
 
03:02:39.870 --> 03:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
from correct however I think it might be
 
03:02:41.110 --> 03:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
that they're saying those who are
 
03:02:42.790 --> 03:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
already operating as Community Mental
 
03:02:44.550 --> 03:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
Health Pro like as providers in our
 
03:02:46.429 --> 03:02:46.439 align:start position:0%
community today could now build this
 
03:02:47.830 --> 03:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
enhanced rate those are my ass
 
03:02:50.110 --> 03:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
assumptions from the way I read this
 
03:02:53.469 --> 03:02:53.479 align:start position:0%
legislation thanks anyone
 
03:03:02.870 --> 03:03:02.880 align:start position:0%

03:04:15.710 --> 03:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so when I think about changes
 
03:04:18.389 --> 03:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
to healthcare policy such as those that
 
03:04:20.670 --> 03:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
are suggested within House Bill
 
03:04:24.910 --> 03:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
636 I always ask myself two questions is
 
03:04:27.469 --> 03:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
this going to be in the betterment for
 
03:04:27.479 --> 03:04:28.670 align:start position:0%
this going to be in the betterment for
the

03:04:28.670 --> 03:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:04:32.030 --> 03:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
community and will this be in the
 
03:04:34.790 --> 03:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
betterment for those of which this
 
03:04:37.870 --> 03:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
possibly will affect and those will be
 
03:04:41.349 --> 03:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
our friends our neighbors our colleagues
 
03:04:44.269 --> 03:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
our teachers our family members who are
 
03:04:46.309 --> 03:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
affected with serious and persistent
 
03:04:49.510 --> 03:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
mental illness today this is an easy
 
03:04:51.830 --> 03:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
question to ask because the answer to
 
03:04:55.070 --> 03:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
both of these things is no the
 
03:04:57.990 --> 03:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
Amendments proposed by House Bill 636
 
03:04:59.870 --> 03:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
will not be to the betterment of our
 
03:05:01.990 --> 03:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
community and it will not be to the
 
03:05:04.070 --> 03:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
betterment of those who suffer with
 
03:05:06.150 --> 03:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
serious and persistent mental
 
03:05:09.349 --> 03:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
illness we have had over 60 years to
 
03:05:12.469 --> 03:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
study the impacts and to know what does
 
03:05:15.150 --> 03:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
and does not work in community-based
 
03:05:17.990 --> 03:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
mental health care and over those 60
 
03:05:21.070 --> 03:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
years we have been able to identify four
 
03:05:23.510 --> 03:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
core critical components of
 
03:05:25.870 --> 03:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
community-based Mental Health Care those
 
03:05:29.229 --> 03:05:29.239 align:start position:0%
are comprehensive team based approach
 
03:05:31.670 --> 03:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
evidence-based psychiatric
 
03:05:35.150 --> 03:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation peer support and then how
 
03:05:39.110 --> 03:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
Faithfully do we Implement models of
 
03:05:42.670 --> 03:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
care three of those four elements
 
03:05:45.750 --> 03:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
require either a psychiatrist or an
 
03:05:49.269 --> 03:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
advanced practice psychi Patric care
 
03:05:51.630 --> 03:05:51.640 align:start position:0%
provider the Amendments proposed by
 
03:05:52.710 --> 03:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:05:56.150 --> 03:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
636 would not require these programs or
 
03:05:59.349 --> 03:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
providers to have on staff a medical
 
03:06:01.870 --> 03:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
personnel therefore rendering it
 
03:06:05.110 --> 03:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
impossible to deliver three of the four
 
03:06:08.510 --> 03:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
critical components we have seen over
 
03:06:11.030 --> 03:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
the years what happens when that occurs
 
03:06:12.870 --> 03:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
and that is an increase in cost to the
 
03:06:15.510 --> 03:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
communities it is an increase in cost to
 
03:06:17.750 --> 03:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
family members it is an increase and
 
03:06:20.110 --> 03:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
utilization of our criminal justice
 
03:06:22.349 --> 03:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
system and most importantly it's an
 
03:06:24.389 --> 03:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
increase in suffering to those who
 
03:06:26.469 --> 03:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
struggle with
 
03:06:30.349 --> 03:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
spmi individuals with spmi and there are
 
03:06:33.150 --> 03:06:33.160 align:start position:0%
12,37 of them in New Hampshire closely
 
03:06:35.510 --> 03:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
making up 1% of our
 
03:06:37.990 --> 03:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
population they have a medical illness
 
03:06:40.550 --> 03:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
and this illness is a brain disease it
 
03:06:42.510 --> 03:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
is a disease that most often times
 
03:06:45.030 --> 03:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
starts before birth and it continues to
 
03:06:47.309 --> 03:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
progress throughout a person's lifetime
 
03:06:49.309 --> 03:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
think stop wrapping up please yes sir
 
03:06:50.870 --> 03:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
therefore making it no different than
 
03:06:52.670 --> 03:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
anyone else with a chronic disease or
 
03:06:56.030 --> 03:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
cancer so I ask you honorable members if
 
03:06:58.389 --> 03:06:58.399 align:start position:0%
you had a family member that had cancer
 
03:07:00.309 --> 03:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
would you want that person to get
 
03:07:02.830 --> 03:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
treatment at a Cancer Center that did
 
03:07:05.110 --> 03:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
not have a cancer
 
03:07:07.990 --> 03:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
doctor I ask you to please oppose and do
 
03:07:10.590 --> 03:07:10.600 align:start position:0%
not move forward House Bill 636 thank

03:07:21.309 --> 03:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
testimony concludes that if this bill
 
03:07:23.830 --> 03:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
were to pass those who are most
 
03:07:25.590 --> 03:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
vulnerable with severe and persistent
 
03:07:29.110 --> 03:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
mental illness would get a much lesser
 
03:07:32.830 --> 03:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
if any good quality standard of care yes
 
03:07:35.349 --> 03:07:35.359 align:start position:0%

also signed up to speak is is uh Cynthia
 
03:07:55.870 --> 03:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
Whitaker representing New Hampshire
 
03:07:59.269 --> 03:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:01.750 --> 03:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
Association and as I explained to the
 
03:08:03.670 --> 03:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
last individual if you could keep it
 
03:08:05.150 --> 03:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
closer to three minutes instead of five
 
03:08:07.870 --> 03:08:07.880 align:start position:0%
that'd be great yeah sure thing uh thank
 
03:08:10.510 --> 03:08:10.520 align:start position:0%

for the opportunity to testify today I'm
 
03:08:17.870 --> 03:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
Dr Cynthia Whitaker I am a psychologist
 
03:08:18.910 --> 03:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
not a
 
03:08:21.990 --> 03:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist um I've dedicated my U more
 
03:08:23.830 --> 03:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
than 20year career to Community Mental
 
03:08:25.910 --> 03:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
Health Center work here in our state so
 
03:08:28.150 --> 03:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
I'm very familiar with rules regulations
 
03:08:30.269 --> 03:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
and the things that we have in addition
 
03:08:32.990 --> 03:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
as a resident of the Wear Community my
 
03:08:34.870 --> 03:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
child received services from the
 
03:08:36.950 --> 03:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Center uh in the
 
03:08:41.469 --> 03:08:41.479 align:start position:0%
conquered region um so House Bill 636
 
03:08:43.870 --> 03:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
changes uh things related to the system
 
03:08:45.030 --> 03:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
I mean you've heard the difference
 
03:08:47.910 --> 03:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
between provider and program uh so for
 
03:08:50.309 --> 03:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
me there's two big things on here one
 
03:08:52.229 --> 03:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
folks have already talked about the
 
03:08:55.790 --> 03:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
change from um psychi psychiatric to
 
03:08:57.830 --> 03:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
psychological which we know does not
 
03:08:59.550 --> 03:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
make sense for individuals with severe
 
03:09:02.030 --> 03:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
and persistent mental illness um you'll
 
03:09:06.309 --> 03:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
hear um or read in uh nami's um
 
03:09:09.309 --> 03:09:09.319 align:start position:0%
testimony about first episode psychosis
 
03:09:11.750 --> 03:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
as a specific program that really
 
03:09:14.349 --> 03:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
requires specific oversight by a
 
03:09:16.349 --> 03:09:16.359 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist to make sure that we're not
 
03:09:18.750 --> 03:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
overmedicating young individuals who are
 
03:09:21.190 --> 03:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
experiencing that the other piece that I
 
03:09:22.790 --> 03:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
would like to point out within the
 
03:09:25.469 --> 03:09:25.479 align:start position:0%
legislature is that um in the proposed
 
03:09:28.590 --> 03:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
Bill the idea of that shift to other
 
03:09:31.389 --> 03:09:31.399 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Providers doesn't just
 
03:09:35.269 --> 03:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
allow Medicaid providers in our system
 
03:09:38.269 --> 03:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
but essentially allows for profit
 
03:09:41.349 --> 03:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
providers in our system this goes
 
03:09:43.469 --> 03:09:43.479 align:start position:0%
against all the work that has had
 
03:09:45.830 --> 03:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support in our legislature
 
03:09:48.349 --> 03:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
thus far around the improvements to the
 
03:09:50.750 --> 03:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
system of care here in New Hampshire
 
03:09:52.750 --> 03:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
moving toward certified community
 
03:09:55.429 --> 03:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
behavioral health centers uh the gold
 
03:09:57.550 --> 03:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
standard really in our country around
 
03:09:59.510 --> 03:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
what community-based care could look
 
03:10:03.429 --> 03:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
like that Federal standard requires that
 
03:10:06.429 --> 03:10:06.439 align:start position:0%
Health Providers be
 
03:10:08.990 --> 03:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
nonprofits I feel if people were here
 
03:10:11.389 --> 03:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
and there had been such a bill to change
 
03:10:13.710 --> 03:10:13.720 align:start position:0%
community health centers or
 
03:10:16.710 --> 03:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
fqhcs and allow those to be for-profits
 
03:10:18.429 --> 03:10:18.439 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be having a
 
03:10:20.670 --> 03:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
conversation but because of the stigma
 
03:10:22.790 --> 03:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
against mental health we want folks that
 
03:10:25.110 --> 03:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
you know for profit let's a increase
 
03:10:28.070 --> 03:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
access to care but Mental Health Care
 
03:10:30.150 --> 03:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
should not be for-profit on the backs of
 
03:10:32.150 --> 03:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
individuals who are very
 
03:10:35.550 --> 03:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
vulnerable um and so for those reasons
 
03:10:38.990 --> 03:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
we're very against um Against The Spill
 
03:10:40.550 --> 03:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
again others have spoken to the
 
03:10:42.429 --> 03:10:42.439 align:start position:0%
psychiatric piece the current
 
03:10:46.429 --> 03:10:46.439 align:start position:0%
regulations um the HMS that we have 403
 
03:10:46.439 --> 03:10:47.830 align:start position:0%
regulations um the HMS that we have 403
426

03:10:47.830 --> 03:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
426
 
03:10:49.590 --> 03:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
they require community mental health
 
03:10:52.590 --> 03:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
programs to have a chief medical officer
 
03:10:54.990 --> 03:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
to have specialized programs for uh
 
03:10:56.910 --> 03:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
individuals who are older adults and
 
03:10:59.070 --> 03:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
that that must have a specialized
 
03:11:01.750 --> 03:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
provider who is familiar with medical
 
03:11:04.670 --> 03:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
necessity in that population as well as
 
03:11:07.550 --> 03:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
specialized providers for children um
 
03:11:09.550 --> 03:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
because giving medication to Children
 
03:11:12.550 --> 03:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
also requires that oversight so we are
 
03:11:15.950 --> 03:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
against people coming into our state um
 
03:11:19.150 --> 03:11:19.160 align:start position:0%
for profit taking the state's money and
 
03:11:21.469 --> 03:11:21.479 align:start position:0%
then us needing to require the state to
 
03:11:23.229 --> 03:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
look for more because we are the ones
 
03:11:24.710 --> 03:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
who are required to treat people
 
03:11:27.150 --> 03:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
regardless of their ability to pay so I
 
03:11:29.030 --> 03:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
am open to your questions and again
 
03:11:32.150 --> 03:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you any
 
03:11:35.950 --> 03:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative Lucas um so if
 
03:11:39.550 --> 03:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
if if I could just um make sure I
 
03:11:42.269 --> 03:11:42.279 align:start position:0%
understand the point you're making
 
03:11:45.550 --> 03:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
so if if a for-profit
 
03:11:49.389 --> 03:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
center um that is super supervised by
 
03:11:52.590 --> 03:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
psychologist um designs sees a patient
 
03:11:57.070 --> 03:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
and Designs a program of care if it
 
03:12:00.469 --> 03:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
involves medication then that individual
 
03:12:02.830 --> 03:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
would then have to see a
 
03:12:05.150 --> 03:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist and determine whether or
 
03:12:08.550 --> 03:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
not that that recommendation for medical
 
03:12:11.429 --> 03:12:11.439 align:start position:0%
medication is appropriate and then to
 
03:12:13.870 --> 03:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
receive that actual prescription and
 
03:12:15.510 --> 03:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
treatment from the psychiatrist so
 
03:12:18.389 --> 03:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't that add another layer or extra
 
03:12:21.950 --> 03:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
visit it AB it absolutely does and thank
 
03:12:24.429 --> 03:12:24.439 align:start position:0%
you for that question um because a lot
 
03:12:26.229 --> 03:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
of the the standards of care the
 
03:12:29.269 --> 03:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
research that uh Dr Amesbury spoke to
 
03:12:30.750 --> 03:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
suggests that the best care people
 
03:12:33.389 --> 03:12:33.399 align:start position:0%
receive is when it's coordinated so we
 
03:12:35.910 --> 03:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
have specialized teams that have case
 
03:12:38.750 --> 03:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
managers therapists doctors that work
 
03:12:40.469 --> 03:12:40.479 align:start position:0%
together so that there's a team that
 
03:12:42.830 --> 03:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
coordinates that care so to remove or
 
03:12:45.510 --> 03:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
separate that psychiatric care would not
 
03:12:47.429 --> 03:12:47.439 align:start position:0%
provide the best care to individuals
 
03:12:48.750 --> 03:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
with severe and persistent mental
 
03:12:50.870 --> 03:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
illness and could potentially increase
 
03:12:52.750 --> 03:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
costs because now you have to see extra
 
03:12:54.510 --> 03:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
providers for extra visits because the
 
03:12:56.870 --> 03:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
care is not
 
03:12:59.950 --> 03:12:59.960 align:start position:0%
coordinated anyone else representative
 
03:13:02.070 --> 03:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
Tes thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:13:05.910 --> 03:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question um could you my
 
03:13:09.510 --> 03:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
understanding uh is that we have for a
 
03:13:12.429 --> 03:13:12.439 align:start position:0%
very long time had a Workforce shortage
 
03:13:14.630 --> 03:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
um and especially trying to recruit
 
03:13:17.309 --> 03:13:17.319 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Providers to New Hampshire
 
03:13:20.550 --> 03:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
so would a solution to what we're uh
 
03:13:23.030 --> 03:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
inferring is being proposed as the
 
03:13:25.790 --> 03:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
problem to be solved uh these mental
 
03:13:27.550 --> 03:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
health providers could probably find
 
03:13:29.510 --> 03:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
work at the community health centers
 
03:13:31.750 --> 03:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
rather than setting up competing
 
03:13:34.269 --> 03:13:34.279 align:start position:0%
shops yes thank you for that question I
 
03:13:37.269 --> 03:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
mean certainly right and and currently
 
03:13:41.229 --> 03:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
any other providers can provide as um uh
 
03:13:43.830 --> 03:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
DHHS testified to they can provide
 
03:13:46.710 --> 03:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
therapy medication and Medicaid services
 
03:13:48.510 --> 03:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
but because they don't have the
 
03:13:50.469 --> 03:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
coordinated Specialty Care that we do
 
03:13:52.309 --> 03:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the teams
 
03:13:54.870 --> 03:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
working together which allows us in some
 
03:13:58.590 --> 03:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
ways to mitigate some of the um
 
03:14:01.190 --> 03:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortages and and I would also
 
03:14:04.229 --> 03:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
add um that because the 10 community
 
03:14:06.269 --> 03:14:06.279 align:start position:0%
mental health programs have an
 
03:14:08.710 --> 03:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
association and work very closely with
 
03:14:10.070 --> 03:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
03:14:13.229 --> 03:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
Services many of us have made strides um
 
03:14:15.590 --> 03:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
in our Workforce shortage and a lot of
 
03:14:17.309 --> 03:14:17.319 align:start position:0%
times I think as a legislature hear
 
03:14:18.950 --> 03:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
about the negatives and not the
 
03:14:22.229 --> 03:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
positives um but the ccbhc work has now
 
03:14:24.950 --> 03:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
expanded to three out of our 10 centers
 
03:14:27.710 --> 03:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
um all of whom um are doing a lot of
 
03:14:31.309 --> 03:14:31.319 align:start position:0%
work um to bring in uh new staff from
 
03:14:35.910 --> 03:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
other places um so yes there's
 
03:14:38.349 --> 03:14:38.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity instead of
 
03:14:41.269 --> 03:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
creating um competition which would then
 
03:14:43.349 --> 03:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
require more oversight from the state
 
03:14:47.190 --> 03:14:47.200 align:start position:0%
potentially more cost to our consumers
 
03:14:49.790 --> 03:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
um to to coordinate together to
 
03:14:52.950 --> 03:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
collaborate rather than to
 
03:14:56.229 --> 03:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
compete anyone else any other
 
03:15:04.110 --> 03:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:06.670 --> 03:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Sam
 
03:15:17.150 --> 03:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:18.229 --> 03:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman members of the
 
03:15:19.710 --> 03:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
committee for the opportunity to testify
 
03:15:21.189 --> 03:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
today for the record my name is Sam
 
03:15:23.150 --> 03:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
Hawkins I'm here today representing Nami
 
03:15:25.750 --> 03:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh to really urge some
 
03:15:27.309 --> 03:15:27.319 align:start position:0%
caution with this bill and share our
 
03:15:29.389 --> 03:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
concerns around the two key changes that
 
03:15:31.870 --> 03:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
it makes to state law so as you're
 
03:15:33.550 --> 03:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
likely aware the community mental health
 
03:15:35.870 --> 03:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
centers are required to provide services
 
03:15:37.590 --> 03:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
to all of their patients all of their
 
03:15:39.630 --> 03:15:39.640 align:start position:0%
clients regardless of their ability to
 
03:15:41.429 --> 03:15:41.439 align:start position:0%
pay as such they serve plenty of
 
03:15:43.150 --> 03:15:43.160 align:start position:0%
individuals who are uninsured or
 
03:15:45.510 --> 03:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
underinsured and one key population that
 
03:15:48.189 --> 03:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
they serve is Medicaid beneficiaries who
 
03:15:50.309 --> 03:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
have a monthly spend down before those
 
03:15:53.269 --> 03:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
Medicaid benefits kick in so uh these
 
03:15:55.590 --> 03:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
folks do incur bills for those Services
 
03:15:57.790 --> 03:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
before the Medicaid benefits kick in um
 
03:15:59.550 --> 03:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
but many are unable to pay them and
 
03:16:01.070 --> 03:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
essentially these bills become
 
03:16:03.030 --> 03:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care incurred by the
 
03:16:05.590 --> 03:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers uh our
 
03:16:10.229 --> 03:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
concern is that uh as these new programs
 
03:16:12.030 --> 03:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
uh presumably would not be held to the
 
03:16:14.670 --> 03:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
same requirements to provide uh care to
 
03:16:16.349 --> 03:16:16.359 align:start position:0%
everyone regardless of their ability to
 
03:16:19.349 --> 03:16:19.359 align:start position:0%
pay they may be essentially uh taking
 
03:16:21.750 --> 03:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
clients who can pay accessing that
 
03:16:23.710 --> 03:16:23.720 align:start position:0%
enhanced rate and then leaving the
 
03:16:25.630 --> 03:16:25.640 align:start position:0%
clients who cannot pay to the Community
 
03:16:28.229 --> 03:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers uh so it's taking
 
03:16:31.189 --> 03:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
away the crucial uh financial support
 
03:16:32.870 --> 03:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
for the Community Mental Health Centers
 
03:16:35.030 --> 03:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
leaving them with the uncompensated care
 
03:16:36.750 --> 03:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
furthering the financial strain on those
 
03:16:38.630 --> 03:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
centers and potentially jeopardizing
 
03:16:40.269 --> 03:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
their ability to continue providing
 
03:16:42.710 --> 03:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
services to the community I'll also
 
03:16:45.469 --> 03:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
speak briefly about the uh change to the
 
03:16:47.070 --> 03:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
requirement that a psychiatrist to
 
03:16:49.389 --> 03:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
provide the medical oversight um this is
 
03:16:52.150 --> 03:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
extremely concerning for us uh one key
 
03:16:54.710 --> 03:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
example is in cases of first episode
 
03:16:57.229 --> 03:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
psychosis uh these individuals require
 
03:17:00.030 --> 03:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
close medical oversight um so as a way
 
03:17:01.550 --> 03:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
of background the evidence-based
 
03:17:03.790 --> 03:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
treatment for first episode psychosis
 
03:17:05.990 --> 03:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
calls for starting individuals on low
 
03:17:08.389 --> 03:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
doses of medications and increasing them
 
03:17:11.150 --> 03:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
at uh very slow increments so is not to
 
03:17:13.349 --> 03:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily overmedicate these uh
 
03:17:16.950 --> 03:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
these clients with anti-choicers
 
03:17:18.670 --> 03:17:18.680 align:start position:0%
this is such a careful process this
 
03:17:21.150 --> 03:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
practice requires a psychiatrist onsite
 
03:17:24.550 --> 03:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
to carefully uh review regularly uh and
 
03:17:26.710 --> 03:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
make these medication changes so
 
03:17:28.830 --> 03:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
removing that psychiatrist oversight for
 
03:17:31.510 --> 03:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
these very complex psychiatric cases may
 
03:17:33.550 --> 03:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
result in individuals receiving improper
 
03:17:35.070 --> 03:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
care and becoming
 
03:17:37.269 --> 03:17:37.279 align:start position:0%
overmedicated uh in closing again I
 
03:17:39.309 --> 03:17:39.319 align:start position:0%
would just urge the committee to use the
 
03:17:41.710 --> 03:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
utmost caution when considering these
 
03:17:44.870 --> 03:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
changes um so that folks really get the
 
03:17:46.910 --> 03:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
high quality care they need uh and and
 
03:17:49.030 --> 03:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
that we don't uh to put it simply
 
03:17:50.870 --> 03:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
destabilize our entire Community Mental
 
03:17:52.910 --> 03:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
Health System and I'm happy to take any
 
03:17:57.630 --> 03:17:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:00.750 --> 03:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:18:03.830 --> 03:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:18:06.550 --> 03:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
for your
 
03:18:10.030 --> 03:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
testimony uh the community mental health
 
03:18:13.469 --> 03:18:13.479 align:start position:0%
system has developed over the
 
03:18:18.030 --> 03:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
years and has grown positively
 
03:18:21.590 --> 03:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh even though we're having extreme
 
03:18:25.910 --> 03:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
difficulty with getting well-qualified
 
03:18:28.429 --> 03:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
people I think the
 
03:18:32.990 --> 03:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
system and if you agree that it is a
 
03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:33.950 align:start position:0%
system and if you agree that it is a
very

03:18:33.950 --> 03:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:18:37.429 --> 03:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
unusual system in the sense that they
 
03:18:37.439 --> 03:18:39.950 align:start position:0%
unusual system in the sense that they
have

03:18:39.950 --> 03:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:42.550 --> 03:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
qualifications on all
 
03:18:47.429 --> 03:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
levels and that a variety
 
03:18:50.229 --> 03:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
of care is needed depending on the
 
03:18:55.189 --> 03:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
individual a person with severe mental
 
03:18:57.229 --> 03:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
health problems that ended up in New
 
03:19:01.309 --> 03:19:01.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital requires a team
 
03:19:05.550 --> 03:19:05.560 align:start position:0%
approach others may not uh so that we
 
03:19:08.590 --> 03:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
have a welldeveloped
 
03:19:13.670 --> 03:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
system and that uh any changes to that
 
03:19:17.630 --> 03:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh I would ask if that's appropriate
 
03:19:19.910 --> 03:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question um
 
03:19:21.910 --> 03:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
I would absolutely agree that treatment
 
03:19:24.070 --> 03:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
looks different for every person um
 
03:19:25.750 --> 03:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
treatment is possible for every person
 
03:19:27.389 --> 03:19:27.399 align:start position:0%
but it looks different and it does
 
03:19:28.950 --> 03:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
require uh oftentimes a
 
03:19:31.710 --> 03:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary team of providers I
 
03:19:34.189 --> 03:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
think we have a very strong uh Community
 
03:19:35.550 --> 03:19:35.560 align:start position:0%
Mental Health System here in New
 
03:19:37.150 --> 03:19:37.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think our community mental
 
03:19:40.950 --> 03:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
health centers are uh well well prepared
 
03:19:43.150 --> 03:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
um and uh really the best equipped in
 
03:19:45.189 --> 03:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
the state to handle these issues I think
 
03:19:47.150 --> 03:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
obviously there are always we can
 
03:19:49.750 --> 03:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
improve any system to ensure um everyone
 
03:19:51.910 --> 03:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
can access the care they need but uh we
 
03:19:54.030 --> 03:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
are severely concerned uh that this
 
03:19:55.590 --> 03:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
would jeopardize the great progress we
 
03:19:57.110 --> 03:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
have made in our community mental health
 
03:19:59.830 --> 03:19:59.840 align:start position:0%

I'd like to reconvene uh and recognized
 
03:33:26.429 --> 03:33:26.439 align:start position:0%
representative Yuri palazov who was a
 
03:33:28.110 --> 03:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
member of this committee for the
 
03:33:31.630 --> 03:33:31.640 align:start position:0%
introduction of Bill 664a of which he's
 
03:33:34.150 --> 03:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor representative
 
03:33:38.070 --> 03:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
palazov uh thank you Mr chair uh for the
 
03:33:41.790 --> 03:33:41.800 align:start position:0%
record my name is uh y po representing
 
03:33:45.790 --> 03:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
Mary Mark hook Dan Barton and I am here
 
03:33:48.510 --> 03:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
to introduce House Bill
 
03:33:51.510 --> 03:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
664a relative to to Childhood
 
03:33:51.520 --> 03:33:53.309 align:start position:0%
664a relative to to Childhood
immunization

03:33:53.309 --> 03:33:53.319 align:start position:0%
immunization
 
03:33:56.150 --> 03:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
requirements uh New Hampshire overall is
 
03:34:01.110 --> 03:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
one of the most religious states uh and
 
03:34:06.229 --> 03:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
it is natural to have uh certain
 
03:34:09.750 --> 03:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
superstitions uh and uh we can see how
 
03:34:12.910 --> 03:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
old superstitions go away and new
 
03:34:16.750 --> 03:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
superstitions became popular but as we
 
03:34:20.790 --> 03:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
are here legislate or even mandate
 
03:34:24.030 --> 03:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
certain Medical Treatments it's
 
03:34:26.910 --> 03:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
important to try to follow
 
03:34:29.550 --> 03:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
science and not
 
03:34:33.269 --> 03:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
superstitions and uh otherwise and this
 
03:34:37.630 --> 03:34:37.640 align:start position:0%
bill is an attempt to go back to the
 
03:34:37.640 --> 03:34:38.670 align:start position:0%
bill is an attempt to go back to the
gold

03:34:38.670 --> 03:34:38.680 align:start position:0%
gold
 
03:34:42.870 --> 03:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
standard of Science and uh this is
 
03:34:46.510 --> 03:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
Placebo trials
 
03:34:52.070 --> 03:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh I I gave you uh this uh uh handout uh
 
03:34:56.990 --> 03:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
from uh I I can uh sorry for the small
 
03:35:00.110 --> 03:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
font but the idea is like to follow
 
03:35:06.030 --> 03:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
different uh vaccines available and uh
 
03:35:07.670 --> 03:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh on
 
03:35:11.950 --> 03:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
the uh I think it's 7 column it's uh it
 
03:35:16.269 --> 03:35:16.279 align:start position:0%
shows uh in dark color now uh when
 
03:35:22.189 --> 03:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
was not uh tested against Placebo during
 
03:35:27.469 --> 03:35:27.479 align:start position:0%
trial so you can see uh this uh sad
 
03:35:31.670 --> 03:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
situation when science is not uh
 
03:35:34.070 --> 03:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
followed and
 
03:35:38.990 --> 03:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
um I can think of different ways of like
 
03:35:41.750 --> 03:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
testing certain medications or
 
03:35:41.760 --> 03:35:43.309 align:start position:0%
testing certain medications or
specifically

03:35:43.309 --> 03:35:43.319 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
03:35:46.830 --> 03:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines uh but let's
 
03:35:50.950 --> 03:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh review two major
 
03:35:54.790 --> 03:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
ways and uh why why this
 
03:35:59.710 --> 03:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
bill uh is the the
 
03:36:02.750 --> 03:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
solution uh why why it should be the way
 
03:36:02.760 --> 03:36:03.750 align:start position:0%
solution uh why why it should be the way
of

03:36:03.750 --> 03:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:36:07.950 --> 03:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
placebo uh so about a week ago this
 
03:36:11.349 --> 03:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
committee already heard from the
 
03:36:14.990 --> 03:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
Department that there could be two major
 
03:36:19.349 --> 03:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
ways to ensure vaccine safety it's a pre
 
03:36:23.030 --> 03:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
pre-roll out trials and this is what
 
03:36:27.389 --> 03:36:27.399 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying uh to address and
 
03:36:31.630 --> 03:36:31.640 align:start position:0%
second way is uh after vaccine was roll
 
03:36:35.910 --> 03:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
out uh State epidemiologist mentioned
 
03:36:40.070 --> 03:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
that CDC has this database the systems
 
03:36:45.110 --> 03:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
called called buyers uh to track for uh
 
03:36:45.120 --> 03:36:47.550 align:start position:0%
called called buyers uh to track for uh
aders

03:36:47.550 --> 03:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:51.950 --> 03:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
reactions and uh one of the points of
 
03:36:54.550 --> 03:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
people who trying to
 
03:36:58.550 --> 03:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
oppose uh this bill that uh in front of
 
03:37:02.030 --> 03:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
you they say that the passage of this
 
03:37:05.429 --> 03:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
bill will result in preventable
 
03:37:09.950 --> 03:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
deaths and many of you heard about that
 
03:37:13.070 --> 03:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh in the last few
 
03:37:18.469 --> 03:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
years suddenly we we have uh two DES in
 
03:37:21.550 --> 03:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
texes that were
 
03:37:27.670 --> 03:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh correlated with positive uh misles
 
03:37:32.550 --> 03:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
test and we are being told that uh it's
 
03:37:36.189 --> 03:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
a it's a correlation and
 
03:37:41.150 --> 03:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
cation and what happened with second way
 
03:37:44.269 --> 03:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
to test uh vaccine
 
03:37:48.870 --> 03:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
safety uh uh actually you can check CDC
 
03:37:54.389 --> 03:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
vies database and find not two but
 
03:37:57.990 --> 03:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
hundreds dead kids dead
 
03:38:02.030 --> 03:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
patients uh who are dead after receiving
 
03:38:06.150 --> 03:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
mles vaccine so why we are concentrating
 
03:38:08.870 --> 03:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
on on two
 
03:38:13.870 --> 03:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
kids who are dead with misiles versus of
 
03:38:13.880 --> 03:38:16.110 align:start position:0%
kids who are dead with misiles versus of
hundreds

03:38:16.110 --> 03:38:16.120 align:start position:0%
hundreds
 
03:38:21.429 --> 03:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
of recorded vires uh
 
03:38:25.269 --> 03:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
records and um uh
 
03:38:31.110 --> 03:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
so so uh one options is like uh I think
 
03:38:34.510 --> 03:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't but one of the reason why
 
03:38:38.550 --> 03:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
one of the excuse we are being told that
 
03:38:41.990 --> 03:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh correlation doesn't mean
 
03:38:45.910 --> 03:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
cation so basically CDC
 
03:38:49.830 --> 03:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
virus database for post relase vaccine
 
03:38:53.429 --> 03:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
safety data is not being
 
03:38:57.590 --> 03:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
used and uh it's not providing safety
 
03:39:01.070 --> 03:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
protection even when we see strong
 
03:39:03.790 --> 03:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
signals I don't know if you heard about
 
03:39:08.670 --> 03:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
P RR it's basically a simple Mass
 
03:39:12.670 --> 03:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
equation it's a mathematical standard
 
03:39:16.469 --> 03:39:16.479 align:start position:0%
that was being created to evaluate
 
03:39:19.870 --> 03:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
safety signals uh between between
 
03:39:22.229 --> 03:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
different vaccines and CDC virus
 
03:39:26.550 --> 03:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
database so it's not just account for
 
03:39:30.309 --> 03:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
volume of adverse reactions but also for
 
03:39:32.870 --> 03:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
volume of vaccines
 
03:39:35.070 --> 03:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
administered and what happened when
 
03:39:38.389 --> 03:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
covid vaccine was rolled
 
03:39:42.269 --> 03:39:42.279 align:start position:0%
out the volume of reports went through
 
03:39:42.279 --> 03:39:43.830 align:start position:0%
out the volume of reports went through
the

03:39:43.830 --> 03:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:39:47.269 --> 03:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
roof and uh what happened with PR
 
03:39:50.790 --> 03:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
criteria yeah it showed that covid
 
03:39:55.309 --> 03:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
vaccine is not safe according to PR
 
03:39:58.670 --> 03:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
criteria what was done it was just
 
03:40:01.070 --> 03:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
ignored there was decision like to
 
03:40:04.469 --> 03:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
ignore the pre-established safety
 
03:40:07.469 --> 03:40:07.479 align:start position:0%
standard and try to establish some
 
03:40:11.429 --> 03:40:11.439 align:start position:0%
different standard and go along so
 
03:40:13.990 --> 03:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
basically CDC virus
 
03:40:17.510 --> 03:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
database is more distraction we don't
 
03:40:20.670 --> 03:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
have a good system to track safety of
 
03:40:22.990 --> 03:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine after they roll out so we need
 
03:40:28.070 --> 03:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
to go back to the main uh alternative
 
03:40:30.910 --> 03:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
that is being uh
 
03:40:33.229 --> 03:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
suggested which is
 
03:40:37.510 --> 03:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:41.830 --> 03:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh safety data before all out
 
03:40:46.030 --> 03:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
so uh research and uh what what happened
 
03:40:50.110 --> 03:40:50.120 align:start position:0%
here what what what what parents expect
 
03:40:53.510 --> 03:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
yeah we know that most uh people uh and
 
03:40:55.070 --> 03:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
most parents in New Hampshire are
 
03:40:57.389 --> 03:40:57.399 align:start position:0%
believers they believe that vaccines are
 
03:40:59.429 --> 03:40:59.439 align:start position:0%
safe and effective and most of them
 
03:41:02.429 --> 03:41:02.439 align:start position:0%
believe that uh it it was well
 
03:41:05.590 --> 03:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
researched according to science uh but
 
03:41:08.469 --> 03:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
uh what what what as a parent what would
 
03:41:11.389 --> 03:41:11.399 align:start position:0%
I expect I expect it like with other
 
03:41:15.750 --> 03:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
medications many years of studies
 
03:41:19.990 --> 03:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
with large groups and against placeo to
 
03:41:22.229 --> 03:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
to find if it's actually effective and
 
03:41:24.110 --> 03:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
if it's actually
 
03:41:29.429 --> 03:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
safe and uh if if you go uh to the E
 
03:41:32.590 --> 03:41:32.600 align:start position:0%
column you can see uh for example
 
03:41:37.189 --> 03:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
duration for vaccines it's often uh just
 
03:41:41.429 --> 03:41:41.439 align:start position:0%
days or months they're not being looked
 
03:41:47.149 --> 03:41:47.159 align:start position:0%
for uh uh long trials if if it's like uh
 
03:41:50.229 --> 03:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
3 days research can you in three days uh
 
03:41:53.870 --> 03:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
prove that it doesn't cause autism no
 
03:41:58.189 --> 03:41:58.199 align:start position:0%
you you you cannot and uh some uh can
 
03:42:00.950 --> 03:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
you in three days prove that it causes
 
03:42:03.790 --> 03:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
my carditis no you wouldn't be able to
 
03:42:06.389 --> 03:42:06.399 align:start position:0%
catch that safety signal but more
 
03:42:08.990 --> 03:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
importantly what what's used in control
 
03:42:12.550 --> 03:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
so I suggest gold standard of using
 
03:42:16.309 --> 03:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
placeo as a control and
 
03:42:19.790 --> 03:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
most often uh it's some other vaccine
 
03:42:23.630 --> 03:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
that is used to be as a control and
 
03:42:25.870 --> 03:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
those uh vaccines who are used as a
 
03:42:28.830 --> 03:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
controls are often also known to uh
 
03:42:30.030 --> 03:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
cause a
 
03:42:33.309 --> 03:42:33.319 align:start position:0%
significant uh number of side effects
 
03:42:36.309 --> 03:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
and significant volume of side effects
 
03:42:41.950 --> 03:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
so that comparison doesn't bring uh much
 
03:42:46.550 --> 03:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
confidence so uh that's what this bill
 
03:42:52.189 --> 03:42:52.199 align:start position:0%
is about uh let's not go from uh beliefs
 
03:42:55.389 --> 03:42:55.399 align:start position:0%
unfunded beliefs but if we are mandating
 
03:43:00.030 --> 03:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
something let's go from gold standard of
 
03:43:03.590 --> 03:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh research uh some opponents of this
 
03:43:07.269 --> 03:43:07.279 align:start position:0%
bill were saying that uh if this bill
 
03:43:11.269 --> 03:43:11.279 align:start position:0%
would be uh enacted we won't be able to
 
03:43:14.349 --> 03:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
uh roll out flu vaccine because we don't
 
03:43:17.469 --> 03:43:17.479 align:start position:0%
have time to research it for flu season
 
03:43:19.750 --> 03:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh but uh more accurately would be
 
03:43:23.429 --> 03:43:23.439 align:start position:0%
saying that uh all of these vaccines
 
03:43:27.710 --> 03:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
that uh had no proper study for their
 
03:43:31.070 --> 03:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
safety and efficiency they should not be
 
03:43:33.990 --> 03:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
mandated thank you thank you any
 
03:43:36.630 --> 03:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
questions for representative
 
03:43:40.110 --> 03:43:40.120 align:start position:0%
palazov representative
 
03:43:42.550 --> 03:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:43:44.429 --> 03:43:44.439 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so is the
 
03:43:46.149 --> 03:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
intention because we already have a a
 
03:43:50.750 --> 03:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory vaccine schedule um so is the
 
03:43:54.670 --> 03:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
intention that those vaccines that are
 
03:43:57.429 --> 03:43:57.439 align:start position:0%
already on the schedule would stay on
 
03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
the schedule or is this uh the intention
 
03:44:04.990 --> 03:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:08.149 --> 03:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
p uh thank you it's a it's a good
 
03:44:11.910 --> 03:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
question uh uh uh and uh this bill now
 
03:44:15.670 --> 03:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
in committee so you can amend it uh
 
03:44:21.149 --> 03:44:21.159 align:start position:0%
uh as you feel uh uh appropriate but my
 
03:44:26.070 --> 03:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
my view that uh if safety and efficiency
 
03:44:27.149 --> 03:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
was not
 
03:44:30.110 --> 03:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
scientifically proven we should not
 
03:44:36.429 --> 03:44:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:39.510 --> 03:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
retroactively anyone else representative
 
03:44:43.950 --> 03:44:43.960 align:start position:0%
Woods um just for our edification um are
 
03:44:46.309 --> 03:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
are there one on that would
 
03:44:50.349 --> 03:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
qualify um that we currently use I'm
 
03:44:54.030 --> 03:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
thinking of um something like small poox
 
03:44:55.750 --> 03:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine the
 
03:44:55.760 --> 03:44:57.309 align:start position:0%
vaccine the
polio

03:44:57.309 --> 03:44:57.319 align:start position:0%
polio
 
03:45:00.269 --> 03:45:00.279 align:start position:0%
um those kinds of things that we have
 
03:45:02.950 --> 03:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
been seemingly very effective uh can you
 
03:45:05.389 --> 03:45:05.399 align:start position:0%
give some examples that did have
 
03:45:08.149 --> 03:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
Placebo uh
 
03:45:11.070 --> 03:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
tests yeah what what what shocked me as
 
03:45:15.630 --> 03:45:15.640 align:start position:0%
I was researching this bill like
 
03:45:17.389 --> 03:45:17.399 align:start position:0%
when we deal with some other
 
03:45:17.399 --> 03:45:18.990 align:start position:0%
when we deal with some other
superstitions

03:45:18.990 --> 03:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
superstitions
 
03:45:22.229 --> 03:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
like people would claim that something
 
03:45:25.870 --> 03:45:25.880 align:start position:0%
is happening but they wouldn't like post
 
03:45:30.189 --> 03:45:30.199 align:start position:0%
data that contradicts it but in this
 
03:45:32.389 --> 03:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
case like we are hearing claims that
 
03:45:34.550 --> 03:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
they safe and effective but then you
 
03:45:37.590 --> 03:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
actually can go to FDA website read the
 
03:45:41.950 --> 03:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
insert read the research volume and
 
03:45:45.750 --> 03:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
settings and see that uh it's uh
 
03:45:47.309 --> 03:45:47.319 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
03:45:51.269 --> 03:45:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh scientifical scientifically sound
 
03:45:55.590 --> 03:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
data there was no uh proper lengths of
 
03:45:58.590 --> 03:45:58.600 align:start position:0%
safety reviews know
 
03:46:02.110 --> 03:46:02.120 align:start position:0%
Placebo uh and so on and often control
 
03:46:07.870 --> 03:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
group was very small uh so that uh and
 
03:46:13.630 --> 03:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
uh and yes most vaccines had no Placebo
 
03:46:17.070 --> 03:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
trial in this table you can see that uh
 
03:46:19.389 --> 03:46:19.399 align:start position:0%
there was some attempt to do Placebo
 
03:46:24.429 --> 03:46:24.439 align:start position:0%
trial for covid-19 commun uh vaccine but
 
03:46:27.790 --> 03:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
then on the last column you can see that
 
03:46:31.149 --> 03:46:31.159 align:start position:0%
there was unproper unblinding and when
 
03:46:34.030 --> 03:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
people were vaccinated even in the
 
03:46:38.110 --> 03:46:38.120 align:start position:0%
control group so uh and uh some other
 
03:46:40.469 --> 03:46:40.479 align:start position:0%
problems with that research and on the
 
03:46:43.910 --> 03:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
bottom of that table of vaccine you you
 
03:46:47.870 --> 03:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
can see uh vaccine from uh and sorry if
 
03:46:53.309 --> 03:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
I mispronounce it from D vac uh and uh
 
03:46:55.550 --> 03:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
That vaccine uh
 
03:46:58.670 --> 03:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh I would say there was honest
 
03:47:03.070 --> 03:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
scientific effort to do uh a proper
 
03:47:06.349 --> 03:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
research with fiveyear trial against
 
03:47:08.790 --> 03:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
Placebo and now they
 
03:47:12.389 --> 03:47:12.399 align:start position:0%
don't advise it uh really nearly only in
 
03:47:12.399 --> 03:47:13.389 align:start position:0%
don't advise it uh really nearly only in
certain

03:47:13.389 --> 03:47:13.399 align:start position:0%
certain
 
03:47:16.990 --> 03:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh EX L because that
 
03:47:19.870 --> 03:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
research showed that children and six
 
03:47:25.830 --> 03:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
had severe harm and death uh and uh
 
03:47:31.269 --> 03:47:31.279 align:start position:0%
children so so only if there's some
 
03:47:34.189 --> 03:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
specific health risk of exposure and so
 
03:47:37.229 --> 03:47:37.239 align:start position:0%
on Then That vaccine uh could be used
 
03:47:39.950 --> 03:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
but with understanding of severe side
 
03:47:44.910 --> 03:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
effects uh and I would pose for you from
 
03:47:51.269 --> 03:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
reviewing uh uh even like uh CDC virus
 
03:47:55.349 --> 03:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
database uh uh uh in previous ter I
 
03:47:59.630 --> 03:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
presented uh this committee with data uh
 
03:48:03.790 --> 03:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
on uh New Hampshire CDC data on covid
 
03:48:07.469 --> 03:48:07.479 align:start position:0%
and covid-19 vaccin that uh maximum
 
03:48:09.990 --> 03:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
numbers that CDC came up for New
 
03:48:12.110 --> 03:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents who are minus and
 
03:48:16.910 --> 03:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
who did died with Co is uh one uh but uh
 
03:48:20.229 --> 03:48:20.239 align:start position:0%
if you go to CDC virus database you can
 
03:48:23.950 --> 03:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
find at least three kids who died uh
 
03:48:28.389 --> 03:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
after receiving a covid-19 vaccine so so
 
03:48:33.429 --> 03:48:33.439 align:start position:0%
uh I would uh I I I I don't see any of
 
03:48:37.149 --> 03:48:37.159 align:start position:0%
the mandated vaccine uh that uh showed
 
03:48:40.630 --> 03:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh safety and efficiency from scientific
 
03:48:43.030 --> 03:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
point of
 
03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:49.110 --> 03:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
farmer well I'm going to pick one cuz
 
03:48:51.110 --> 03:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
covid vaccine is not required for
 
03:48:52.389 --> 03:48:52.399 align:start position:0%
children you move your mic up a little
 
03:48:53.710 --> 03:48:53.720 align:start position:0%
bit close a little
 
03:48:56.870 --> 03:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
closer or grow taller thank you Mr
 
03:48:58.030 --> 03:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:49:01.189 --> 03:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
question um but I just I'm looking at
 
03:49:02.790 --> 03:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
measles and I'm trying to figure out
 
03:49:05.670 --> 03:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're trying to get at so
 
03:49:07.990 --> 03:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
the measles vaccine was studied Placebo
 
03:49:10.269 --> 03:49:10.279 align:start position:0%
control back in the 60s it's been
 
03:49:13.710 --> 03:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
revised um and it's been very
 
03:49:16.750 --> 03:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
efficacious measles was essentially
 
03:49:20.590 --> 03:49:20.600 align:start position:0%
eradicated and so I guess are you
 
03:49:22.910 --> 03:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
suggesting that somehow measle the
 
03:49:26.070 --> 03:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
measles vaccine should be restudied
 
03:49:28.229 --> 03:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
before making it acquired in New
 
03:49:30.870 --> 03:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if so who's going to re
 
03:49:32.870 --> 03:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
study it and how would you do that
 
03:49:34.950 --> 03:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
because it's not really ethical to to
 
03:49:38.269 --> 03:49:38.279 align:start position:0%
study a vaccine that's been shown to be
 
03:49:41.110 --> 03:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
efficacious again with Placebo because
 
03:49:43.189 --> 03:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
you'd be giving Placebo to people that
 
03:49:48.750 --> 03:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:48.760 --> 03:49:50.429 align:start position:0%
 
protecting

03:49:50.429 --> 03:49:50.439 align:start position:0%
protecting
 
03:49:54.469 --> 03:49:54.479 align:start position:0%
uh that's a that's uh the last part is a
 
03:49:57.910 --> 03:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
good question how you uh I can see some
 
03:50:03.030 --> 03:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
problems but also um we have different
 
03:50:05.710 --> 03:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
slices of population some
 
03:50:08.870 --> 03:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
population uh want vaccine some
 
03:50:12.389 --> 03:50:12.399 align:start position:0%
population don't want it at all and I
 
03:50:14.990 --> 03:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you you would be able to find
 
03:50:17.830 --> 03:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
people who are ready to study it
 
03:50:22.750 --> 03:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
especially for disease that has uh very
 
03:50:26.070 --> 03:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
low mortality for uh otherwise healthy
 
03:50:30.790 --> 03:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
kids and uh I must say uh uh uh even in
 
03:50:35.750 --> 03:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
the latest uh CDC uh data sheet on
 
03:50:40.590 --> 03:50:40.600 align:start position:0%
misles outbreak in Texas um you you can
 
03:50:42.950 --> 03:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
read about history of this issue and
 
03:50:46.110 --> 03:50:46.120 align:start position:0%
that uh mortality from
 
03:50:49.550 --> 03:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
misles was reduced significantly even
 
03:50:52.790 --> 03:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
before any misles vaccine was
 
03:50:56.910 --> 03:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
available uh so uh there's
 
03:51:03.710 --> 03:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:05.830 --> 03:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
delus thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:51:10.110 --> 03:51:10.120 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um does
 
03:51:15.110 --> 03:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
this bill as amended re uh stop people
 
03:51:18.229 --> 03:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
from getting vaccines any vaccine that
 
03:51:22.469 --> 03:51:22.479 align:start position:0%
they choose to to
 
03:51:26.510 --> 03:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
use yeah absolutely not uh if uh people
 
03:51:30.550 --> 03:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
believe in vaccine and uh most uh people
 
03:51:33.630 --> 03:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
and most parents in New Hamshire believe
 
03:51:36.189 --> 03:51:36.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh that vaccines are safe and
 
03:51:40.269 --> 03:51:40.279 align:start position:0%
effective I I I don't share that believe
 
03:51:42.269 --> 03:51:42.279 align:start position:0%
because it's not scientific but if they
 
03:51:47.110 --> 03:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:49.950 --> 03:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
medications any final
 
03:51:58.070 --> 03:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:00.750 --> 03:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak at Colleen
 
03:52:02.790 --> 03:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
Smith and Dr Benjamin Chan from the
 
03:52:25.469 --> 03:52:25.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:27.469 --> 03:52:27.479 align:start position:0%
it works it works
 
03:52:30.830 --> 03:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
yes uh good afternoon Mr chair members
 
03:52:32.590 --> 03:52:32.600 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh thank you for the
 
03:52:34.309 --> 03:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come before you and and
 
03:52:37.550 --> 03:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
testify on this uh Bill House Bill 664
 
03:52:39.030 --> 03:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
my name is Dr Benjamin Shan I'm the
 
03:52:40.630 --> 03:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
state epidemiologist could you get a
 
03:52:41.710 --> 03:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
little closer please at the New
 
03:52:43.149 --> 03:52:43.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Health and Human
 
03:52:44.990 --> 03:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
Services and I'm joined today by collean
 
03:52:47.950 --> 03:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
Smith who's the chief of our Bureau of
 
03:52:49.590 --> 03:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
of Infectious Disease Control within
 
03:52:53.910 --> 03:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
Public Health um we are uh opposed to
 
03:52:55.590 --> 03:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill uh
 
03:52:59.229 --> 03:52:59.239 align:start position:0%
664 um because we believe that this
 
03:53:01.309 --> 03:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
legislation would prevent the department
 
03:53:04.950 --> 03:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
from requiring any of the vaccines
 
03:53:08.030 --> 03:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
currently required under RSA 141c and
 
03:53:11.229 --> 03:53:11.239 align:start position:0%
the associated uh administrative rules
 
03:53:13.710 --> 03:53:13.720 align:start position:0%
um uh for vaccines required for
 
03:53:15.269 --> 03:53:15.279 align:start position:0%
attendance at New Hampshire schools and
 
03:53:17.870 --> 03:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
childcare agencies none of the vaccines
 
03:53:20.469 --> 03:53:20.479 align:start position:0%
currently listed none of the 10 vaccines
 
03:53:22.110 --> 03:53:22.120 align:start position:0%
or diseases that vaccines protect
 
03:53:24.710 --> 03:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
against uh that are currently listed and
 
03:53:26.469 --> 03:53:26.479 align:start position:0%
required for attendance at school or
 
03:53:29.870 --> 03:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
child care agencies uh have been studied
 
03:53:32.349 --> 03:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
against an inner Placebo meaning none of
 
03:53:34.590 --> 03:53:34.600 align:start position:0%
the currently licensed um and
 
03:53:37.429 --> 03:53:37.439 align:start position:0%
recommended vaccines uh these required
 
03:53:40.750 --> 03:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines have been used and studied uh
 
03:53:43.830 --> 03:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
for decades including in clinical trials
 
03:53:46.269 --> 03:53:46.279 align:start position:0%
including in randomized controlled
 
03:53:48.670 --> 03:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
clinical trials uh to ensure that they
 
03:53:51.030 --> 03:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
are safe and effective um but the
 
03:53:52.710 --> 03:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
currently licensed vaccines have not
 
03:53:56.269 --> 03:53:56.279 align:start position:0%
been studied against Placebo controlled
 
03:53:59.670 --> 03:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
randomized clinical trials um Placebo
 
03:54:01.469 --> 03:54:01.479 align:start position:0%
controlled randomized clinical trials
 
03:54:04.189 --> 03:54:04.199 align:start position:0%
are just one type of study but they are
 
03:54:06.950 --> 03:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
not the gold standard for vaccine
 
03:54:08.790 --> 03:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
approval and recommendations because it
 
03:54:12.469 --> 03:54:12.479 align:start position:0%
is not possible or ethical to conduct
 
03:54:15.389 --> 03:54:15.399 align:start position:0%
these types of studies on the vaccines
 
03:54:18.189 --> 03:54:18.199 align:start position:0%
currently in use when an existing
 
03:54:21.429 --> 03:54:21.439 align:start position:0%
vaccine is available um it becomes the
 
03:54:23.950 --> 03:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
gold standard against which new or
 
03:54:25.910 --> 03:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
updated vaccines are compared not
 
03:54:29.309 --> 03:54:29.319 align:start position:0%
placebos but the existing vaccines uh
 
03:54:30.870 --> 03:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
that that are out there
 
03:54:33.790 --> 03:54:33.800 align:start position:0%
already the currently required vaccines
 
03:54:36.149 --> 03:54:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh that are listed under RSA 141c and
 
03:54:38.189 --> 03:54:38.199 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules have changed
 
03:54:40.750 --> 03:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
over time to make them safer and more
 
03:54:43.070 --> 03:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
effective and so when new versions of
 
03:54:45.269 --> 03:54:45.279 align:start position:0%
these vaccines have become available
 
03:54:48.110 --> 03:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
they can't be compared against placebos
 
03:54:49.950 --> 03:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
rather they are compared against older
 
03:54:53.750 --> 03:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
versions of vaccines newer formulations
 
03:54:56.269 --> 03:54:56.279 align:start position:0%
uh or other formulations of the vaccines
 
03:54:58.469 --> 03:54:58.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes even unrelated vaccines that
 
03:55:00.110 --> 03:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
are part of normal preventive care
 
03:55:02.229 --> 03:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
recommendations because those preventive
 
03:55:04.189 --> 03:55:04.199 align:start position:0%
care recommendations are part of the um
 
03:55:06.910 --> 03:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
what we call standard of care um and to
 
03:55:08.990 --> 03:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
give you an example the inactivated
 
03:55:11.990 --> 03:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
poliovirus vaccine uh currently in use
 
03:55:14.469 --> 03:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
today um the first iteration of that
 
03:55:17.389 --> 03:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
vaccine was introduced in 1955 after
 
03:55:19.149 --> 03:55:19.159 align:start position:0%
being studied in one of the largest
 
03:55:21.710 --> 03:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
placebocontrolled clinical vaccine
 
03:55:24.910 --> 03:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
trials um history uh That vaccine
 
03:55:27.950 --> 03:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
however was updated to an enhanced
 
03:55:30.590 --> 03:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
inactivated polio virus vaccine that was
 
03:55:31.870 --> 03:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
introduced in the
 
03:55:34.110 --> 03:55:34.120 align:start position:0%
1990s uh which is currently in use in
 
03:55:36.830 --> 03:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
the US today this updated vaccine didn't
 
03:55:39.910 --> 03:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
undergo a new Placebo controlled
 
03:55:43.590 --> 03:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
clinical trial uh rather in fact was you
 
03:55:45.710 --> 03:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
know used in fact studied in other
 
03:55:47.830 --> 03:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
countries before being um more widely
 
03:55:50.349 --> 03:55:50.359 align:start position:0%
adopted in the US um but rather it
 
03:55:52.149 --> 03:55:52.159 align:start position:0%
efficacy was evaluated by the vaccine's
 
03:55:54.590 --> 03:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
ability to produce neutralizing antibody
 
03:55:57.429 --> 03:55:57.439 align:start position:0%
protection against the virus um because
 
03:55:59.550 --> 03:55:59.560 align:start position:0%
Decades of use and study had shown that
 
03:56:01.910 --> 03:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
the vaccine was was safe and effective
 
03:56:04.910 --> 03:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
so in summary all required vaccines um
 
03:56:06.830 --> 03:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
have been in use for decades with an
 
03:56:09.429 --> 03:56:09.439 align:start position:0%
excellent safety and efficacy record and
 
03:56:11.429 --> 03:56:11.439 align:start position:0%
while none of the currently required
 
03:56:14.510 --> 03:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
licensed vaccines or licensed version
 
03:56:16.070 --> 03:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
have undergone Placebo controlled
 
03:56:18.389 --> 03:56:18.399 align:start position:0%
clinical trials they have been studied
 
03:56:20.349 --> 03:56:20.359 align:start position:0%
in various types of different clinical
 
03:56:22.790 --> 03:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
trials over Decades of use to show that
 
03:56:24.590 --> 03:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
they are both safe and effective and
 
03:56:26.349 --> 03:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
these vaccines have led to dramatic
 
03:56:28.110 --> 03:56:28.120 align:start position:0%
declines in diseases preventing millions
 
03:56:31.349 --> 03:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
of infections and saving uh lives so uh
 
03:56:33.429 --> 03:56:33.439 align:start position:0%
with that let me end my formal testimony
 
03:56:34.630 --> 03:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your attention and
 
03:56:36.309 --> 03:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
we'll be happy to answer any questions
 
03:56:38.269 --> 03:56:38.279 align:start position:0%
that the uh committee may have thank you
 
03:56:41.149 --> 03:56:41.159 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions representative
 
03:56:43.349 --> 03:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
Kastle ring thank you Mr chair so I'm
 
03:56:45.309 --> 03:56:45.319 align:start position:0%
looking at the this it looks like a CDC
 
03:56:47.870 --> 03:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
report that was handed out um picture
 
03:56:48.710 --> 03:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
and there's a thing that says
 
03:56:51.229 --> 03:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
vaccinations of us children born between
 
03:56:55.070 --> 03:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
90 1994 in 2021 says these estimates uh
 
03:56:56.910 --> 03:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
there's prevented disease like different
 
03:56:58.429 --> 03:56:58.439 align:start position:0%
statistics here and they're all saying
 
03:57:00.469 --> 03:57:00.479 align:start position:0%
estimate estimate can you tell me how
 
03:57:01.870 --> 03:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
those estimates are created or where
 
03:57:03.990 --> 03:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
these studies are from because it it
 
03:57:05.189 --> 03:57:05.199 align:start position:0%
seems that there's not a lot of
 
03:57:08.510 --> 03:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
information where these studies come
 
03:57:11.429 --> 03:57:11.439 align:start position:0%
from yeah so I I'd have to go back and
 
03:57:13.429 --> 03:57:13.439 align:start position:0%
look at the rest at the reference to uh
 
03:57:15.990 --> 03:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
see exactly how the estimates were done
 
03:57:19.149 --> 03:57:19.159 align:start position:0%
um many of these uh most of these
 
03:57:22.710 --> 03:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
diseases are reportable diseases um in
 
03:57:25.510 --> 03:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
Most states uh and so there's data
 
03:57:27.790 --> 03:57:27.800 align:start position:0%
coming in at a at a national level on
 
03:57:29.910 --> 03:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
these um on these infections or on these
 
03:57:32.710 --> 03:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
diseases uh but it's not always 100%
 
03:57:33.830 --> 03:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
capture and so there's different
 
03:57:36.269 --> 03:57:36.279 align:start position:0%
statistical methods for how in this case
 
03:57:38.149 --> 03:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
I think the CDC estimates the total
 
03:57:40.189 --> 03:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
burden but I'd have to go back and look
 
03:57:41.710 --> 03:57:41.720 align:start position:0%
at the at the reference which I think is
 
03:57:43.870 --> 03:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of this fact sheet to okay
 
03:57:45.910 --> 03:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
give provide more details on how those
 
03:57:48.149 --> 03:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
estimates were provided or made follow
 
03:57:50.349 --> 03:57:50.359 align:start position:0%
up follow up so does New Hampshire
 
03:57:52.870 --> 03:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
specifically have any other calculation
 
03:57:54.790 --> 03:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
method or method to be able to get these
 
03:57:58.229 --> 03:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
statistics versus what you've handed us
 
03:58:01.030 --> 03:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
here um so so New Hampshire is not
 
03:58:02.990 --> 03:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
creating these these estimates I mean
 
03:58:04.429 --> 03:58:04.439 align:start position:0%
they getting any statistics from
 
03:58:06.189 --> 03:58:06.199 align:start position:0%
anywhere else or do you utilize anything
 
03:58:09.309 --> 03:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
specific sorry to clarify for for
 
03:58:10.630 --> 03:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
estimates your question is about
 
03:58:12.750 --> 03:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
estimates at uh preventing disease
 
03:58:14.510 --> 03:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
preventing infections where did where do
 
03:58:16.189 --> 03:58:16.199 align:start position:0%
you get the statistics from what
 
03:58:17.670 --> 03:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
statistics do you utilize as the
 
03:58:19.670 --> 03:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
department let's put it that way um well
 
03:58:21.149 --> 03:58:21.159 align:start position:0%
I think it depends on what the the
 
03:58:22.429 --> 03:58:22.439 align:start position:0%
question is if it's about disease
 
03:58:24.309 --> 03:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
occurrence New Hampshire has data on
 
03:58:26.710 --> 03:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
disease occurrence because um it's
 
03:58:29.590 --> 03:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
they're these are reportable diseases um
 
03:58:32.429 --> 03:58:32.439 align:start position:0%
if the question is about estimates on um
 
03:58:34.790 --> 03:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
preventable diseases from vaccines those
 
03:58:36.229 --> 03:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
are not produced at a state or local
 
03:58:37.510 --> 03:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
level those come from our national
 
03:58:40.670 --> 03:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
federal Partners primarily the CDC
 
03:58:42.349 --> 03:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
although there are other um agencies
 
03:58:43.389 --> 03:58:43.399 align:start position:0%
that are out there there are other
 
03:58:45.309 --> 03:58:45.319 align:start position:0%
states that are are doing more
 
03:58:47.070 --> 03:58:47.080 align:start position:0%
calculations but New Hampshire has never
 
03:58:49.309 --> 03:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
estimated or done our own estimates on
 
03:58:52.189 --> 03:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
number of preventable diseases uh
 
03:58:55.229 --> 03:58:55.239 align:start position:0%
averted from vaccination one last one
 
03:58:57.550 --> 03:58:57.560 align:start position:0%
okay so you're saying that you you you
 
03:59:01.870 --> 03:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
use the cdc's information here as your
 
03:59:04.950 --> 03:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
guide so so we we use the information
 
03:59:08.070 --> 03:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
coming from the CDC in this case in this
 
03:59:10.389 --> 03:59:10.399 align:start position:0%
in this infographic uh but certainly we
 
03:59:12.110 --> 03:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
use information and data for multiple
 
03:59:14.229 --> 03:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
different sources not just the CDC you
 
03:59:16.149 --> 03:59:16.159 align:start position:0%
know when it comes to looking at vaccine
 
03:59:19.229 --> 03:59:19.239 align:start position:0%
safety vaccine efficacy um many of those
 
03:59:22.110 --> 03:59:22.120 align:start position:0%
studies are are done by other states
 
03:59:23.389 --> 03:59:23.399 align:start position:0%
academic organizations the
 
03:59:25.630 --> 03:59:25.640 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies that are
 
03:59:27.710 --> 03:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
funding the clinical trials to get them
 
03:59:31.269 --> 03:59:31.279 align:start position:0%
approved Etc okay thank you
 
03:59:33.790 --> 03:59:33.800 align:start position:0%
representative Woods thank you Mr chair
 
03:59:36.510 --> 03:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
03:59:38.750 --> 03:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to refocus on sort of the
 
03:59:40.950 --> 03:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
central part of this bill and that's the
 
03:59:42.349 --> 03:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
03:59:44.830 --> 03:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
placebo you
 
03:59:47.550 --> 03:59:47.560 align:start position:0%
sort of uh went over that a little bit
 
03:59:49.790 --> 03:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
but I think it might be worthwhile just
 
03:59:53.389 --> 03:59:53.399 align:start position:0%
going over again you know the concept of
 
03:59:56.710 --> 03:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
placebo being the quotes gold standard
 
03:59:59.990 --> 04:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
that that we hear uh versus other
 
04:00:02.670 --> 04:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
techniques of uh double blind studies
 
04:00:05.670 --> 04:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
Etc and so forth how they fit into you
 
04:00:09.710 --> 04:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
know making it a as a good trial and uh
 
04:00:11.389 --> 04:00:11.399 align:start position:0%
if you could just expand on so we can
 
04:00:14.510 --> 04:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
clarify the difference in getting
 
04:00:20.189 --> 04:00:20.199 align:start position:0%
something to a patient uh safely um Etc
 
04:00:21.550 --> 04:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah uh representative thank
 
04:00:23.469 --> 04:00:23.479 align:start position:0%
you for that question so I think the the
 
04:00:26.030 --> 04:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
bottom line is that there are uh
 
04:00:28.469 --> 04:00:28.479 align:start position:0%
multiple different types of clinical
 
04:00:31.510 --> 04:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
trials a placebo controlled randomized
 
04:00:34.110 --> 04:00:34.120 align:start position:0%
clinical trial is just one type of study
 
04:00:36.590 --> 04:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
or one way to conduct a study using a
 
04:00:39.710 --> 04:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
placebo um but as mentioned uh those
 
04:00:43.070 --> 04:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
studies cannot be done um they're
 
04:00:45.790 --> 04:00:45.800 align:start position:0%
unethical to be conducted um on the
 
04:00:47.389 --> 04:00:47.399 align:start position:0%
currently used
 
04:00:50.710 --> 04:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines um because there's already
 
04:00:52.710 --> 04:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines available that are in use those
 
04:00:55.830 --> 04:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
are the standard of care so anytime a
 
04:00:58.149 --> 04:00:58.159 align:start position:0%
new drug a new therapeutic comes to
 
04:00:59.790 --> 04:00:59.800 align:start position:0%
Market they they it goes through a
 
04:01:01.750 --> 04:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
series of different types of clinical
 
04:01:03.990 --> 04:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
trials sometimes but not always that
 
04:01:06.269 --> 04:01:06.279 align:start position:0%
ends in you know what we call a phase
 
04:01:07.750 --> 04:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
three clinical trial where you have a
 
04:01:09.429 --> 04:01:09.439 align:start position:0%
placebo controlled randomized double
 
04:01:11.990 --> 04:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
blinded clinical trial but even before
 
04:01:14.309 --> 04:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
that there are you know phase one trials
 
04:01:16.070 --> 04:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
which are looking at you know dosing you
 
04:01:17.910 --> 04:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
know different doses of a medication you
 
04:01:21.070 --> 04:01:21.080 align:start position:0%
get into phase two studies uh which look
 
04:01:24.030 --> 04:01:24.040 align:start position:0%
at safety of vaccines in a population
 
04:01:25.550 --> 04:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
these are not Placebo controlled
 
04:01:26.830 --> 04:01:26.840 align:start position:0%
clinical trials but they're still
 
04:01:29.309 --> 04:01:29.319 align:start position:0%
clinical trials um when you're not able
 
04:01:31.070 --> 04:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
to do a placebo controlled clinical
 
04:01:33.309 --> 04:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
trial as in the as is the case with
 
04:01:35.389 --> 04:01:35.399 align:start position:0%
existing vaccines there are other types
 
04:01:37.870 --> 04:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
of trials that can and have be done have
 
04:01:40.990 --> 04:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
been done on these vaccines um you know
 
04:01:44.550 --> 04:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
using uh other other measures to look at
 
04:01:47.870 --> 04:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
safety and efficacy of a vaccine um
 
04:01:49.710 --> 04:01:49.720 align:start position:0%
measuring infection rates in between
 
04:01:52.590 --> 04:01:52.600 align:start position:0%
different populations um looking at uh
 
04:01:54.429 --> 04:01:54.439 align:start position:0%
antibody responses some of these
 
04:01:56.070 --> 04:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
diseases have been around for so long
 
04:01:58.550 --> 04:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
that we know that at a certain antibody
 
04:01:59.870 --> 04:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
level in a person's body they're
 
04:02:01.790 --> 04:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
protected from a disease so some of the
 
04:02:03.950 --> 04:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
clinical trials will look at you know
 
04:02:06.590 --> 04:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
the vaccine's ability to induce or
 
04:02:08.990 --> 04:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
create a body's immune response
 
04:02:10.790 --> 04:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
specifically looking at the efficacy of
 
04:02:13.910 --> 04:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
the vaccine um and then as I think was
 
04:02:15.910 --> 04:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
referenced last week in another bill
 
04:02:17.510 --> 04:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
there are you know postmarketing
 
04:02:20.429 --> 04:02:20.439 align:start position:0%
clinical trials that are done again not
 
04:02:22.630 --> 04:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
Placebo controlled uh but they're
 
04:02:25.550 --> 04:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
looking at uh studying the vaccine in
 
04:02:28.670 --> 04:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
real world use um you know many of these
 
04:02:31.149 --> 04:02:31.159 align:start position:0%
clinical trials that are done more
 
04:02:33.309 --> 04:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
formally have maybe you know tens of
 
04:02:35.790 --> 04:02:35.800 align:start position:0%
thousands of people when you get the
 
04:02:37.469 --> 04:02:37.479 align:start position:0%
vaccine out into real world use you have
 
04:02:39.389 --> 04:02:39.399 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands millions of people
 
04:02:41.590 --> 04:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
getting the vaccine which allows further
 
04:02:43.670 --> 04:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to study and so some of
 
04:02:43.680 --> 04:02:44.389 align:start position:0%
opportunity to study and so some of
these

04:02:44.389 --> 04:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:02:45.750 --> 04:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh all of these vaccines that are
 
04:02:48.309 --> 04:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
currently required under RSA 141c have
 
04:02:51.110 --> 04:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
been in use for decades and hence have
 
04:02:53.910 --> 04:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
Decades of study and decades um of you
 
04:02:56.269 --> 04:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
know clinical study in use um behind
 
04:02:59.670 --> 04:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
them so I I think the requiring a
 
04:03:03.149 --> 04:03:03.159 align:start position:0%
placebo controlled clinical trial is
 
04:03:04.830 --> 04:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
somewhat metaphorically missing the
 
04:03:06.790 --> 04:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
forest for the trees right the tree
 
04:03:08.710 --> 04:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
being the placebo controlled clinical
 
04:03:11.030 --> 04:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
trial the forest being all of the other
 
04:03:12.910 --> 04:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
clinical studies and trials that have
 
04:03:14.349 --> 04:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
been conducted on these vaccines over
 
04:03:16.790 --> 04:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
Decades of
 
04:03:20.030 --> 04:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
use any other questions representative
 
04:03:22.469 --> 04:03:22.479 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:03:25.309 --> 04:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so you know so I
 
04:03:26.830 --> 04:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
understand your point and as
 
04:03:29.389 --> 04:03:29.399 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer also really
 
04:03:33.030 --> 04:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
pointed out the moral problems with
 
04:03:36.229 --> 04:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
having an existing vaccine and you know
 
04:03:39.630 --> 04:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
insisting on having a placebo but you
 
04:03:41.550 --> 04:03:41.560 align:start position:0%
know and I'm just trying to understand
 
04:03:43.429 --> 04:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
ultimately you need to have some kind of
 
04:03:45.590 --> 04:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
Base line and you talked a little bit
 
04:03:48.070 --> 04:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
about the enhanced polio vaccine and we
 
04:03:50.510 --> 04:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
didn't have a placebo with that but it
 
04:03:52.670 --> 04:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
was compared I guess back to the the
 
04:03:55.389 --> 04:03:55.399 align:start position:0%
prior polio vaccine now that prior polio
 
04:03:58.950 --> 04:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine it was done by a placebo so
 
04:04:01.510 --> 04:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
there is a baseline there so you have a
 
04:04:03.950 --> 04:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
kind of chain of custody back to a point
 
04:04:08.670 --> 04:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
where there is this Baseline so um if in
 
04:04:11.670 --> 04:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
the history of that you don't have an
 
04:04:14.550 --> 04:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
inert an inert placebo
 
04:04:16.790 --> 04:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
what other methodology do you have in
 
04:04:19.469 --> 04:04:19.479 align:start position:0%
order to establish that Baseline I'm I'm
 
04:04:21.269 --> 04:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand absent that
 
04:04:23.389 --> 04:04:23.399 align:start position:0%
how do you do
 
04:04:23.399 --> 04:04:25.030 align:start position:0%
how do you do
that

04:04:25.030 --> 04:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:04:27.710 --> 04:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
yeah excuse me well I think that likely
 
04:04:30.590 --> 04:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
will vary vaccine by vaccine um and
 
04:04:32.309 --> 04:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
disease by disease right and there's a
 
04:04:35.550 --> 04:04:35.560 align:start position:0%
difference in studies for safety and
 
04:04:38.670 --> 04:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
studies for efficacy or effectiveness of
 
04:04:41.670 --> 04:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
of a vaccine at preventing disease um in
 
04:04:45.510 --> 04:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
terms of you know and they're studied
 
04:04:48.309 --> 04:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
you know both aspects of vaccines are
 
04:04:50.149 --> 04:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
studied sometimes in different studies
 
04:04:51.510 --> 04:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
or different trials sometimes in the
 
04:04:54.670 --> 04:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
same trial um when it and there's more
 
04:04:56.790 --> 04:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
detail in I think the testimony that was
 
04:04:59.309 --> 04:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
um circulated in terms of how some of
 
04:05:01.590 --> 04:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
the different vaccines um might have
 
04:05:03.349 --> 04:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
been studied in clinical trials there's
 
04:05:04.910 --> 04:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
some um bullet points that we've
 
04:05:07.429 --> 04:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
provided in terms of um how you know
 
04:05:09.710 --> 04:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
vaccine efficacy specifically might be
 
04:05:12.189 --> 04:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
assessed um but goes back to some of the
 
04:05:14.030 --> 04:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
testimony I gave about comparing ing it
 
04:05:16.870 --> 04:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
to an older version of the vaccine
 
04:05:20.910 --> 04:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
comparing a new formulation to um uh
 
04:05:23.429 --> 04:05:23.439 align:start position:0%
other formulations of the vaccine right
 
04:05:25.670 --> 04:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
the the other issue we get into slight
 
04:05:28.510 --> 04:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
tangent here is that um you know it a
 
04:05:31.389 --> 04:05:31.399 align:start position:0%
lot of times the um the first vaccine
 
04:05:33.110 --> 04:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
that comes out might be studied in a
 
04:05:35.349 --> 04:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
placebo controlled clinical trial but
 
04:05:37.510 --> 04:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
there are multiple pharmaceutical
 
04:05:39.710 --> 04:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
companies that might make a for example
 
04:05:41.910 --> 04:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
the measles vaccine and so the first one
 
04:05:44.269 --> 04:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
of the market maybe is studied with
 
04:05:46.030 --> 04:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
against a place Placebo controlled
 
04:05:47.830 --> 04:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
clinical trial but then a company comes
 
04:05:50.269 --> 04:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
out with their own version of the
 
04:05:53.110 --> 04:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine they can't study that against a
 
04:05:55.070 --> 04:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
placebo they have to study it against
 
04:05:56.870 --> 04:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
the vaccine that's already in use to
 
04:05:58.630 --> 04:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
make sure it's providing the same level
 
04:06:01.389 --> 04:06:01.399 align:start position:0%
of protection and efficacy so sometimes
 
04:06:03.070 --> 04:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines different formulations of the
 
04:06:05.990 --> 04:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine are compared against one another
 
04:06:08.950 --> 04:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
um uh we can look at you know infection
 
04:06:11.229 --> 04:06:11.239 align:start position:0%
rates uh in vaccinated versus
 
04:06:15.189 --> 04:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated persons uh some diseases as
 
04:06:16.910 --> 04:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
I mentioned there are known antibody
 
04:06:19.710 --> 04:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
levels that we know provide a high level
 
04:06:21.269 --> 04:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
of protection against disease so
 
04:06:22.590 --> 04:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes vaccines will be compared
 
04:06:25.189 --> 04:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
against you know their ability to
 
04:06:27.110 --> 04:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
promote or induce antibody levels in a
 
04:06:28.790 --> 04:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
person so there's a variety of different
 
04:06:30.670 --> 04:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
ways that vaccine Effectiveness can be
 
04:06:32.590 --> 04:06:32.600 align:start position:0%
studied um and it's going to really vary
 
04:06:34.189 --> 04:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
vaccine by vaccine and disease by
 
04:06:36.710 --> 04:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
disease and what other vaccines might be
 
04:06:40.149 --> 04:06:40.159 align:start position:0%
available follow up so so just to set
 
04:06:42.710 --> 04:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
everybody's mind at these in and you may
 
04:06:44.590 --> 04:06:44.600 align:start position:0%
not may know may not know the answer to
 
04:06:46.910 --> 04:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
this but if you look at the vaccines
 
04:06:48.990 --> 04:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
that are on our current schedule like
 
04:06:51.030 --> 04:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
the measles vaccine as we discussed the
 
04:06:55.110 --> 04:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
current version isn't Placebo controlled
 
04:06:57.389 --> 04:06:57.399 align:start position:0%
but if I look at these vaccines that are
 
04:07:00.670 --> 04:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
on the schedule if I look at the history
 
04:07:04.229 --> 04:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
do they at some point tie back to a
 
04:07:06.630 --> 04:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
placebo or that kind of Baseline are you
 
04:07:10.030 --> 04:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
aware um I I don't I don't have 100%
 
04:07:12.030 --> 04:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
data on that some of them I know are
 
04:07:14.510 --> 04:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
others I I'm I'm not sure or how how far
 
04:07:16.910 --> 04:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
back you go what uh what kind of
 
04:07:19.990 --> 04:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
clinical trials you will find uh again
 
04:07:21.790 --> 04:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
some of these were studied back in the
 
04:07:21.800 --> 04:07:23.309 align:start position:0%
some of these were studied back in the
1950s

04:07:23.309 --> 04:07:23.319 align:start position:0%
1950s
 
04:07:26.149 --> 04:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
1960s um
 
04:07:29.030 --> 04:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
so any final questions representative
 
04:07:31.710 --> 04:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you so my final question
 
04:07:36.149 --> 04:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
would be so am I wrong to read the
 
04:07:38.109 --> 04:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
language of this
 
04:07:41.469 --> 04:07:41.479 align:start position:0%
statute as saying that any
 
04:07:44.830 --> 04:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
new variant of any
 
04:07:48.710 --> 04:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
vaccine would require the inert
 
04:07:52.429 --> 04:07:52.439 align:start position:0%
Placebo uh study before it could be used
 
04:07:56.349 --> 04:07:56.359 align:start position:0%
we've talked a lot here about the chain
 
04:07:59.349 --> 04:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
of you do a placebo study and then you
 
04:08:01.630 --> 04:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
establish a certain effective rate and
 
04:08:05.229 --> 04:08:05.239 align:start position:0%
then you compare the new formulations to
 
04:08:10.950 --> 04:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
the last approved vaccine but wouldn't
 
04:08:14.389 --> 04:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
we be required if we adopt this
 
04:08:18.030 --> 04:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
to require a new inert Placebo study
 
04:08:21.670 --> 04:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
before we mandated any new
 
04:08:24.790 --> 04:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
vaccines um if I understand your
 
04:08:26.550 --> 04:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
question correctly representative I I
 
04:08:29.510 --> 04:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
believe so and I I read this as also
 
04:08:33.389 --> 04:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
applying to um you know historically or
 
04:08:35.950 --> 04:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
look back at currently required vaccines
 
04:08:37.750 --> 04:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
and specific to their current licensed
 
04:08:41.269 --> 04:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
version so any new vaccine going forward
 
04:08:43.510 --> 04:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
um or any of the currently required re
 
04:08:46.149 --> 04:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
ired vaccines uh and their currently
 
04:08:49.469 --> 04:08:49.479 align:start position:0%
licensed versions would be required to
 
04:08:52.070 --> 04:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
have been compared in a clinical trial
 
04:08:54.070 --> 04:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh against an inner Placebo that's how I
 
04:08:57.389 --> 04:08:57.399 align:start position:0%
read the test uh the legislation thank
 
04:08:59.750 --> 04:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
you okay one more question
 
04:09:02.070 --> 04:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative TZ last question thank
 
04:09:03.830 --> 04:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
my question um Dr Chan can you speak a
 
04:09:12.309 --> 04:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
little bit to what I heard in the um in
 
04:09:13.910 --> 04:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:09:17.030 --> 04:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
and sort of the motivation for uh this
 
04:09:21.870 --> 04:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
bill is maybe a concern about uh safety
 
04:09:23.910 --> 04:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
or harmful side effects can you shed a
 
04:09:26.189 --> 04:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
little light for us on sort of that
 
04:09:28.790 --> 04:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
Dimension because we know that vaccines
 
04:09:30.109 --> 04:09:30.119 align:start position:0%
have saved millions and millions of
 
04:09:31.710 --> 04:09:31.720 align:start position:0%
lived and prevented millions and
 
04:09:34.550 --> 04:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
millions of infections so some people
 
04:09:37.469 --> 04:09:37.479 align:start position:0%
seem to be concerned about the amount of
 
04:09:40.149 --> 04:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
potential harm I guess can you shed
 
04:09:42.149 --> 04:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
light on that from sort of a population
 
04:09:44.469 --> 04:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
and public health perspective for us
 
04:09:47.149 --> 04:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
please uh yes uh representative thanks
 
04:09:48.990 --> 04:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
for that question and and I I guess I
 
04:09:51.149 --> 04:09:51.159 align:start position:0%
would um say that safety is studied at
 
04:09:53.990 --> 04:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
multiple levels uh in clinical trials
 
04:09:55.750 --> 04:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
both before a vaccine is approved and
 
04:09:59.389 --> 04:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
recommended and also um after it's
 
04:10:00.990 --> 04:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
approved and recommended what we call
 
04:10:04.229 --> 04:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
postm marketing um study uh of vaccines
 
04:10:05.950 --> 04:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
and and I think I heard I was having a
 
04:10:07.590 --> 04:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
hard time Hearing in the back but I
 
04:10:10.109 --> 04:10:10.119 align:start position:0%
think I heard reference to some of the
 
04:10:15.109 --> 04:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
systems uh that uh CDC and F da use um
 
04:10:18.590 --> 04:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
to monitor vaccine safety th those are
 
04:10:21.189 --> 04:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
systems um that current are in use
 
04:10:23.670 --> 04:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
currently in use for all vaccines uh
 
04:10:26.349 --> 04:10:26.359 align:start position:0%
that collect data on um adverse side
 
04:10:29.429 --> 04:10:29.439 align:start position:0%
effects after uh that could be related
 
04:10:31.590 --> 04:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
to vaccination after somebody is
 
04:10:33.189 --> 04:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
vaccinated I I heard reference I think
 
04:10:35.750 --> 04:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
to some some death numbers um I will
 
04:10:40.229 --> 04:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
just say that uh that it is
 
04:10:43.830 --> 04:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
required that any person who died
 
04:10:46.309 --> 04:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
after receiving a vaccine regardless of
 
04:10:49.429 --> 04:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
the cause of death um get reported to
 
04:10:51.349 --> 04:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
some of these National systems like
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
theirs V uh vaccine adverse event
 
04:10:55.550 --> 04:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
Reporting System there's also vaccine
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
safety safety data link and others um
 
04:11:02.830 --> 04:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
and so having um a report made does not
 
04:11:06.309 --> 04:11:06.319 align:start position:0%
mean that uh vaccine caused that
 
04:11:08.590 --> 04:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
reaction or that death it's a simply a
 
04:11:10.349 --> 04:11:10.359 align:start position:0%
way of collecting information so that
 
04:11:12.229 --> 04:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
further investigation can be done to
 
04:11:15.670 --> 04:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
ensure that the vaccine is safe post
 
04:11:17.510 --> 04:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
marketing or after lure after
 
04:11:19.870 --> 04:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation because clinical trials
 
04:11:21.910 --> 04:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
themselves are limited right as I
 
04:11:24.750 --> 04:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned clinical trials usually the
 
04:11:26.429 --> 04:11:26.439 align:start position:0%
larger ones are conducted with tens of
 
04:11:28.469 --> 04:11:28.479 align:start position:0%
thousands of people but that may not be
 
04:11:31.070 --> 04:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
enough to identify very rare occurrences
 
04:11:32.710 --> 04:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
of side effects or disease that might
 
04:11:34.550 --> 04:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
only come out after millions of people
 
04:11:36.990 --> 04:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
are vaccinated the only way you get that
 
04:11:38.550 --> 04:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
data is by having these National
 
04:11:40.510 --> 04:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
surveillance systems in place uh
 
04:11:43.229 --> 04:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
requiring reporting of any potential
 
04:11:44.910 --> 04:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
adverse reaction whether or not it's
 
04:11:47.030 --> 04:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
related to a vaccine so many many of
 
04:11:48.790 --> 04:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
these numbers that you may um hear
 
04:11:51.590 --> 04:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
quoted about deaths after vaccination um
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
is what we call Raw data um it's
 
04:11:56.990 --> 04:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
required to be reported uh but most of
 
04:11:58.990 --> 04:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
the time if if not the majority of the
 
04:12:02.070 --> 04:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
time um the vaccine is not contributing
 
04:12:03.910 --> 04:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
to or causing a person's death it's
 
04:12:06.229 --> 04:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
simply part of the required reporting
 
04:12:09.309 --> 04:12:09.319 align:start position:0%
for monitoring after a vaccine is put in
 
04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
use and um used in a population
 
04:12:15.189 --> 04:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
hopefully that was
 
04:12:22.630 --> 04:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:25.790 --> 04:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Julie Kim

Pediatrics you've asked for five minutes
 
04:12:33.750 --> 04:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
again if you could keep it to three I'd
 
04:12:33.760 --> 04:12:36.189 align:start position:0%
again if you could keep it to three I'd
appreciate

04:12:36.189 --> 04:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:40.189 --> 04:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
it thanks so much for having me today um
 
04:12:42.670 --> 04:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Dr Julie Kim I'm a
 
04:12:44.830 --> 04:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
pediatric hematologist and oncologist
 
04:12:47.349 --> 04:12:47.359 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I also serve as
 
04:12:49.189 --> 04:12:49.199 align:start position:0%

04:12:50.830 --> 04:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
chapter of the American Academy of
 
04:12:53.389 --> 04:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics I represent over 200
 
04:12:55.910 --> 04:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
pediatricians in this great state I've
 
04:12:57.630 --> 04:12:57.640 align:start position:0%
been an oncologist in our state for over
 
04:12:59.870 --> 04:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
20 years and I've had the fortunate uh
 
04:13:01.550 --> 04:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity of raising my own children
 
04:13:03.389 --> 04:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
here I'm here today to urge you to
 
04:13:06.469 --> 04:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
oppose House Bill 664 the provisions of
 
04:13:08.670 --> 04:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
this legislation if enacted would
 
04:13:11.149 --> 04:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily and unethically expose
 
04:13:12.630 --> 04:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
children to life-threatening vaccine
 
04:13:14.830 --> 04:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
preventable diseases in the initial
 
04:13:16.750 --> 04:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
development of new vaccines and the
 
04:13:19.349 --> 04:13:19.359 align:start position:0%
ongoing distribution of vaccines in New
 
04:13:21.269 --> 04:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire child and adolesent
 
04:13:23.429 --> 04:13:23.439 align:start position:0%
immunizations are already subject to R
 
04:13:25.309 --> 04:13:25.319 align:start position:0%
rigorous levels of testing that are
 
04:13:27.429 --> 04:13:27.439 align:start position:0%
unrivaled by other interventions that we
 
04:13:28.950 --> 04:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
as pediatricians use to keep our
 
04:13:31.630 --> 04:13:31.640 align:start position:0%
patients healthy as we talked about as
 
04:13:33.349 --> 04:13:33.359 align:start position:0%
Dr Chan talked about clinical trials for
 
04:13:35.189 --> 04:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
vaccines follow rigorous scientific
 
04:13:37.630 --> 04:13:37.640 align:start position:0%
standards Placebo controlled trials are
 
04:13:39.750 --> 04:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
only a gold standard if there is no
 
04:13:41.590 --> 04:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
other previously proven vaccine
 
04:13:43.710 --> 04:13:43.720 align:start position:0%
available on the market however when
 
04:13:46.469 --> 04:13:46.479 align:start position:0%
approved vaccines exist regulators and
 
04:13:48.070 --> 04:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
scientific ethics committees would not
 
04:13:49.870 --> 04:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
typically accept a placebo controlled
 
04:13:51.990 --> 04:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
trial design because doing so would
 
04:13:53.710 --> 04:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
prevent access to actually approved
 
04:13:56.189 --> 04:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
vaccines for clinical trial PR
 
04:13:58.109 --> 04:13:58.119 align:start position:0%
participants and leave them vulnerable
 
04:14:00.550 --> 04:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
to vaccine present preventable diseases
 
04:14:03.229 --> 04:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
as a pediatric oncologist this would be
 
04:14:05.590 --> 04:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
equivalent to somebody trying to get the
 
04:14:07.990 --> 04:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
newest chemotherapy we couldn't just
 
04:14:09.750 --> 04:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
tell people they couldn't get any cancer
 
04:14:11.950 --> 04:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
the chemotherapy just to try out this
 
04:14:14.510 --> 04:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
new one so we always tested against
 
04:14:16.750 --> 04:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
what's the most uh recent and what is
 
04:14:18.950 --> 04:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
considered the current standard of
 
04:14:21.070 --> 04:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
Care at a time when we are seeing a
 
04:14:22.710 --> 04:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
Resurgence of serious diseases like
 
04:14:24.870 --> 04:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
measles and whooping cough alongside the
 
04:14:26.750 --> 04:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
spread of respiratory diseases like
 
04:14:29.149 --> 04:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
seasonal influenza and RSV it is
 
04:14:30.750 --> 04:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
important for us all of us to remember
 
04:14:33.189 --> 04:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
the role that vaccine confidence plays
 
04:14:35.830 --> 04:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
in ensuring uptake across this popula a
 
04:14:38.030 --> 04:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
large population to bring it to a
 
04:14:40.510 --> 04:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
personal level my own patients are imuno
 
04:14:42.790 --> 04:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
compromised as are many elderly people
 
04:14:45.070 --> 04:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
or adults in our state who have chronic
 
04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
diseases a few years ago one of my own
 
04:14:49.590 --> 04:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
patients who had leukemia suffered
 
04:14:51.349 --> 04:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
terrible seizures and ultimately died
 
04:14:53.269 --> 04:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
from an overwhelming Chickenpox vaccine
 
04:14:56.309 --> 04:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
or overwhelming chickenpox disease after
 
04:14:58.750 --> 04:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
being exposed to an unvaccinated child
 
04:15:00.189 --> 04:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
this child's death probably could have
 
04:15:01.750 --> 04:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
been prevented had the other child and
 
04:15:04.109 --> 04:15:04.119 align:start position:0%
those child's contacts been vaccinated
 
04:15:06.630 --> 04:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
against chickenpox so undermining
 
04:15:08.590 --> 04:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine confidence through unnecessary
 
04:15:11.510 --> 04:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
actions such as this in the legislature
 
04:15:14.510 --> 04:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
gains us nothing and it puts much at uh
 
04:15:17.550 --> 04:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
at unnecessary risk especially children
 
04:15:20.870 --> 04:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
so I urge you to um protect continue to
 
04:15:23.070 --> 04:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
protect children and to vote no on House
 
04:15:28.070 --> 04:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 664 thank you thank you any
 
04:15:31.990 --> 04:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
questions um representative Drew then
 
04:15:34.510 --> 04:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
representative delus thank you Mr chair
 
04:15:36.469 --> 04:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
if these vaccines were
 
04:15:39.510 --> 04:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
recommended by DHHS and not mandated by
 
04:15:41.550 --> 04:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
Statute would that change your practice
 
04:15:43.990 --> 04:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
in any way
 
04:15:46.030 --> 04:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
uh my practice as a pediatric oncologist
 
04:15:48.309 --> 04:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
my patients cannot get vaccinated so the
 
04:15:50.070 --> 04:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
more kids that can get vaccinated to
 
04:15:52.349 --> 04:15:52.359 align:start position:0%
protect my patients and also protected
 
04:15:54.830 --> 04:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
elderly people um would be beneficial
 
04:15:56.990 --> 04:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
for my patients
 
04:15:59.670 --> 04:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
directly representative
 
04:16:02.269 --> 04:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
delus thank you Mr chairman I think my
 
04:16:04.429 --> 04:16:04.439 align:start position:0%
question actually would would be for a
 
04:16:08.389 --> 04:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
pediatrician who um does vaccinate so I
 
04:16:10.870 --> 04:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
don't believe that this witness is can
 
04:16:14.070 --> 04:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
answer my question I can try you want to
 
04:16:16.830 --> 04:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
try okay well my my question was how
 
04:16:19.830 --> 04:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
many um parents or Guardians actually
 
04:16:22.990 --> 04:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
refuse uh vaccines oh you're right I
 
04:16:24.149 --> 04:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
can't answer that since I'm not a
 
04:16:26.670 --> 04:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
general pediatrician but my patients um
 
04:16:29.189 --> 04:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
who are have oncologic diagnoses their
 
04:16:30.950 --> 04:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
parents do ask if their child can get
 
04:16:32.830 --> 04:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines but just because of the imuno
 
04:16:35.790 --> 04:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
compromised state they're unable to
 
04:16:39.750 --> 04:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
follow up so there is a desire there to
 
04:16:42.070 --> 04:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinate yes there very much is so okay
 
04:16:45.630 --> 04:16:45.640 align:start position:0%
and and is that um more common than not
 
04:16:47.070 --> 04:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
that's I think that's the only thing I
 
04:16:49.070 --> 04:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
know all my patients their families want
 
04:16:51.030 --> 04:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
them to get uh vaccinated to do whatever
 
04:16:52.229 --> 04:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
they can to protect their child while
 
04:16:54.510 --> 04:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
they have this disease okay thank you
 
04:16:56.550 --> 04:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative Castle ring thank you Mr
 
04:16:57.950 --> 04:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
chair just because you have that
 
04:17:00.469 --> 04:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
experience can you elaborate for us uh
 
04:17:02.870 --> 04:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
specifically on those patients that see
 
04:17:04.790 --> 04:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
that I mean I can understand that
 
04:17:06.510 --> 04:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
they're imuno compromised so they can't
 
04:17:07.830 --> 04:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
get vaccines but is there other
 
04:17:09.309 --> 04:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
conditions that they could get because
 
04:17:11.109 --> 04:17:11.119 align:start position:0%
you said chickenpox but like is there
 
04:17:13.109 --> 04:17:13.119 align:start position:0%
are they susceptible to everything be
 
04:17:14.710 --> 04:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
susceptible to any kind of vaccine
 
04:17:16.790 --> 04:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
preventable illness I mean it's
 
04:17:19.870 --> 04:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
influenza um it could be hepatitis uh
 
04:17:21.670 --> 04:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
I've had a patient who died of hepatitis
 
04:17:24.269 --> 04:17:24.279 align:start position:0%
actually um as well and that's a vaccine
 
04:17:28.349 --> 04:17:28.359 align:start position:0%
preventable disease um so I mean any of
 
04:17:30.269 --> 04:17:30.279 align:start position:0%
the vaccine preventable illnesses they
 
04:17:34.990 --> 04:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
would be at risk for okay anyone else
 
04:17:39.429 --> 04:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:42.990 --> 04:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak uh riser
 
04:17:45.429 --> 04:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
Evans representing herself and the
 
04:17:58.630 --> 04:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:02.070 --> 04:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
defense good afternoon can you can you
 
04:18:05.510 --> 04:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
hear me okay thank you
 
04:18:09.149 --> 04:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
um I um am speaking in favor of this
 
04:18:09.159 --> 04:18:10.710 align:start position:0%
um I um am speaking in favor of this
bill

04:18:10.710 --> 04:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:18:14.149 --> 04:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
um I think that we can all agree um from
 
04:18:16.950 --> 04:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
an ethical standpoint that a
 
04:18:19.429 --> 04:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
non-negotiable prerequisite for any
 
04:18:24.950 --> 04:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate is vaccine safety um and
 
04:18:27.550 --> 04:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
I think simply put that nobody in this
 
04:18:29.910 --> 04:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
room would want to require a healthy
 
04:18:32.510 --> 04:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
child to be injected with a vaccine that
 
04:18:34.950 --> 04:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
is not proven to be
 
04:18:38.389 --> 04:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
safe um and so obviously the goal of
 
04:18:41.590 --> 04:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is to make sure that we have
 
04:18:45.109 --> 04:18:45.119 align:start position:0%
um data signed ific data about the true
 
04:18:48.149 --> 04:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
safety profile of a vaccine before that
 
04:18:49.910 --> 04:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine can be
 
04:18:52.269 --> 04:18:52.279 align:start position:0%
mandated now um people have already
 
04:18:54.030 --> 04:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
spoken a bit and we'll speak some more I
 
04:18:57.389 --> 04:18:57.399 align:start position:0%
think today about the shortcomings um in
 
04:18:59.269 --> 04:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
the vaccine manufacturers clinical
 
04:19:02.189 --> 04:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
trials for vaccines that are currently
 
04:19:04.429 --> 04:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
on the cdc's recommended childhood
 
04:19:07.309 --> 04:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
schedule um and in particular about the
 
04:19:09.870 --> 04:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
lack of inert Placebo controls in those
 
04:19:12.790 --> 04:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
trials which makes it impossible to know
 
04:19:15.109 --> 04:19:15.119 align:start position:0%
what the true safety PR profile of those
 
04:19:17.750 --> 04:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines actually what those profiles
 
04:19:20.429 --> 04:19:20.439 align:start position:0%
are because you can't tell what the
 
04:19:22.910 --> 04:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
actual rate is of whatever the adverse
 
04:19:25.469 --> 04:19:25.479 align:start position:0%
event is being measured if you don't
 
04:19:27.990 --> 04:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
have an actual control group that's not
 
04:19:30.670 --> 04:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
getting the um that's not getting the
 
04:19:33.189 --> 04:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
the intervention that's being tested and
 
04:19:35.070 --> 04:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
you know this is recognized there's just
 
04:19:37.590 --> 04:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
no substitute for an inert Placebo
 
04:19:40.830 --> 04:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
control and I believe and and and I urge
 
04:19:42.149 --> 04:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
you to take a look at this book if
 
04:19:43.950 --> 04:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
you're Ed it's called Turtles all the
 
04:19:47.070 --> 04:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
way down um and it's got incredibly well
 
04:19:49.870 --> 04:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
sourced data about the actual trials
 
04:19:51.670 --> 04:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
that were controlled that were that were
 
04:19:53.309 --> 04:19:53.319 align:start position:0%
conducted for all the vaccines on the
 
04:19:54.830 --> 04:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
childhood table and and some of the
 
04:19:56.910 --> 04:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
shortcomings of those trials and also
 
04:19:59.109 --> 04:19:59.119 align:start position:0%
some of the shortcomings of the type of
 
04:20:01.750 --> 04:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
retrospective epidemiological studies
 
04:20:03.550 --> 04:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
that I think have been suggested here as
 
04:20:07.389 --> 04:20:07.399 align:start position:0%
an alternative to real true PL Placebo
 
04:20:10.990 --> 04:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
controlled trials so um but um but I'm a
 
04:20:12.830 --> 04:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
lawyer I'm not a doctor and so I'm
 
04:20:14.830 --> 04:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
actually here to talk just a little bit
 
04:20:16.910 --> 04:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
about the broader legal context for this
 
04:20:18.870 --> 04:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
bill because I think that that is also
 
04:20:21.590 --> 04:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
really important to understand um and
 
04:20:23.990 --> 04:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
that is the federal government's virtual
 
04:20:26.910 --> 04:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
elimination of manufacturer liability
 
04:20:29.550 --> 04:20:29.560 align:start position:0%
for injuries that are caused by vaccines
 
04:20:32.149 --> 04:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
first through the 1986 childhood vaccine
 
04:20:34.550 --> 04:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
injury act and then second through the
 
04:20:38.229 --> 04:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
2011 US Supreme Court opinion um in uh
 
04:20:42.870 --> 04:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
Bruth versus WTH um so both the national
 
04:20:45.229 --> 04:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
vaccine Act and the and the bruis withth
 
04:20:46.750 --> 04:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
case I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing
 
04:20:48.670 --> 04:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
that correctly um but they both
 
04:20:51.349 --> 04:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
recognize that vaccines inevitably have
 
04:20:53.790 --> 04:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
side effects and cause injuries but
 
04:20:56.030 --> 04:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
taken together the vaccine acts and the
 
04:20:58.710 --> 04:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court opinion hold that even
 
04:21:01.469 --> 04:21:01.479 align:start position:0%
when an injury caused by a vaccine on
 
04:21:03.910 --> 04:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
the childhood schedule is caused by a
 
04:21:06.429 --> 04:21:06.439 align:start position:0%
design defect that is the fault of the
 
04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
company that developed and manufactured
 
04:21:10.630 --> 04:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
the vaccine please please stop wrapping
 
04:21:12.910 --> 04:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
up the the the the company has no
 
04:21:14.950 --> 04:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
liability and so just to think about
 
04:21:17.109 --> 04:21:17.119 align:start position:0%
what this means in terms of incentives
 
04:21:19.030 --> 04:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
what are the incentives to prove vaccine
 
04:21:20.830 --> 04:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
designed to make vaccines safer for
 
04:21:22.830 --> 04:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
children when there's no liability at
 
04:21:24.429 --> 04:21:24.439 align:start position:0%
all and I'll just leave you with a quote
 
04:21:26.910 --> 04:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
from Justice Sodom mayor who dissented
 
04:21:28.950 --> 04:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
in the bruis witz Kates and said that
 
04:21:31.469 --> 04:21:31.479 align:start position:0%
the decision to eliminate manufacturer
 
04:21:34.269 --> 04:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
liability leaves a regulatory vacuum in
 
04:21:36.429 --> 04:21:36.439 align:start position:0%
which no one ensures that vaccine
 
04:21:38.750 --> 04:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturers acur adequately take
 
04:21:40.910 --> 04:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
account of the scientific and
 
04:21:43.550 --> 04:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
technological in Advan when designing or
 
04:21:45.469 --> 04:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
Distributing their products and that's
 
04:21:47.670 --> 04:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
why it's so important for you to step in
 
04:21:50.630 --> 04:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
and fill that regulatory Gap thank you
 
04:21:50.640 --> 04:21:52.790 align:start position:0%
and fill that regulatory Gap thank you
any

04:21:52.790 --> 04:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:21:54.870 --> 04:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
questions I'm saying none thank you
 
04:21:54.880 --> 04:21:59.269 align:start position:0%
questions I'm saying none thank you
thank

04:21:59.269 --> 04:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:02.269 --> 04:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Victoria
 
04:22:04.070 --> 04:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
Shaheen for the New Hampshire families
 
04:22:15.389 --> 04:22:15.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh committee members thank you
 
04:22:19.670 --> 04:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I'd like to introduce
 
04:22:22.469 --> 04:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
myself if I could uh my name is Tori
 
04:22:24.870 --> 04:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
Shaheen uh I'm here on behalf of New
 
04:22:27.149 --> 04:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families for vaccines uh we're
 
04:22:29.830 --> 04:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
an organization dedicated to advancing
 
04:22:32.830 --> 04:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
evidence-based legislation and opposing
 
04:22:35.269 --> 04:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
legislation that is based on
 
04:22:37.910 --> 04:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
misinformation and misrepresentation of
 
04:22:37.920 --> 04:22:39.109 align:start position:0%
misinformation and misrepresentation of
existing

04:22:39.109 --> 04:22:39.119 align:start position:0%
existing
 
04:22:43.189 --> 04:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
procedures um so I uh I have a degree in
 
04:22:44.910 --> 04:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
microbiology from the University of New
 
04:22:47.309 --> 04:22:47.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I also have a degree from
 
04:22:48.630 --> 04:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
the University of North Carolina and
 
04:22:51.030 --> 04:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
Chapel Hill in microbiology and
 
04:22:54.710 --> 04:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
Immunology um I've worked for 16 years
 
04:22:57.870 --> 04:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
um for a clinical research organization
 
04:23:00.830 --> 04:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
um you know managing clinical trials
 
04:23:02.710 --> 04:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
essentially um but actually today I'm
 
04:23:06.309 --> 04:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
here as a parent um of a 5-year-old son
 
04:23:09.109 --> 04:23:09.119 align:start position:0%
it's my pride and joy uh so I'm here to
 
04:23:12.510 --> 04:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
voice my strong opposition to Bill 664
 
04:23:14.750 --> 04:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
which places unrealistic expectations on
 
04:23:18.189 --> 04:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
the steady design of vaccine trials um
 
04:23:19.790 --> 04:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
while ignoring critical ethical
 
04:23:22.070 --> 04:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
guidelines that govern the process the
 
04:23:23.790 --> 04:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
bill states that any vaccine required
 
04:23:27.030 --> 04:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
must be tested using ner Placebo um I
 
04:23:28.630 --> 04:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill would revoke the
 
04:23:30.469 --> 04:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
approval of many safe and effective
 
04:23:33.109 --> 04:23:33.119 align:start position:0%
vaccines on the existing schedule that
 
04:23:37.109 --> 04:23:37.119 align:start position:0%
keep our children my son his friends our
 
04:23:40.990 --> 04:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
families safe um and I I don't suspect
 
04:23:43.109 --> 04:23:43.119 align:start position:0%
that any parent um or Community member
 
04:23:45.790 --> 04:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
would want that um I think there might
 
04:23:48.670 --> 04:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
be a some misunderstanding um in terms
 
04:23:51.830 --> 04:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
of what a placebo is um I think previous
 
04:23:53.309 --> 04:23:53.319 align:start position:0%
testimony has really covered that very
 
04:23:55.950 --> 04:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
well I do have a very brief synopsis um
 
04:23:58.389 --> 04:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
of the three types um so an inert
 
04:24:01.149 --> 04:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
Placebo uh for example saline would be
 
04:24:03.070 --> 04:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate to use if we were evaluating
 
04:24:05.389 --> 04:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
a brand new technology uh for example
 
04:24:08.109 --> 04:24:08.119 align:start position:0%
the covid vaccine trials did use uh a
 
04:24:11.349 --> 04:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
saling Placebo for their control group
 
04:24:13.389 --> 04:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
um second one that I actually didn't
 
04:24:15.189 --> 04:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
hear mentioned earlier was that active
 
04:24:17.550 --> 04:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
placebos which would be uh vaccine
 
04:24:20.710 --> 04:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
ingredients absent the actual antigen so
 
04:24:24.349 --> 04:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
the weakened or attenuated bacteria or
 
04:24:26.389 --> 04:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh viral protein that would would
 
04:24:28.590 --> 04:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
trigger the immune response um the
 
04:24:31.389 --> 04:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
reason we use those active placebos um
 
04:24:34.790 --> 04:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
in randomized controlled uh double blind
 
04:24:37.510 --> 04:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
trials is because sometimes the
 
04:24:38.990 --> 04:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
ingredients in a vaccine can cause a
 
04:24:42.189 --> 04:24:42.199 align:start position:0%
little bit of a skin irritation a bump
 
04:24:45.990 --> 04:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
um um some swelling a sore arm and you
 
04:24:49.269 --> 04:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
really want the control group if they
 
04:24:51.590 --> 04:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
rece were to receive a a saling Placebo
 
04:24:53.109 --> 04:24:53.119 align:start position:0%
they would have no irritation and
 
04:24:55.469 --> 04:24:55.479 align:start position:0%
effectively the study would be unblinded
 
04:24:59.469 --> 04:24:59.479 align:start position:0%
so to truly have a double blind uh trial
 
04:25:03.189 --> 04:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
you really want the uh control group and
 
04:25:05.189 --> 04:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
the active uh vaccine group to have like
 
04:25:06.790 --> 04:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
the same reaction on their arm at the
 
04:25:09.830 --> 04:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
injection site so um you know this would
 
04:25:11.990 --> 04:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
be the type of trial if we were looking
 
04:25:13.710 --> 04:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
at side effects which you know there are
 
04:25:16.109 --> 04:25:16.119 align:start position:0%
trials that specifically examine side
 
04:25:18.870 --> 04:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
effects immunogenicity reactogenicity of
 
04:25:23.750 --> 04:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
a vaccine um the circumstance um where a
 
04:25:25.269 --> 04:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
new version of existing vaccines are
 
04:25:28.149 --> 04:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
being Tri stop wrapping up certainly
 
04:25:29.469 --> 04:25:29.479 align:start position:0%
there the comparator vaccine which has
 
04:25:31.189 --> 04:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
been well covered by a previous
 
04:25:33.590 --> 04:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
testimony because it was unethical to
 
04:25:37.229 --> 04:25:37.239 align:start position:0%
leave um people especially children uh
 
04:25:38.790 --> 04:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
without the standard of care which would
 
04:25:40.510 --> 04:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
be an existing vaccine leaving them
 
04:25:43.149 --> 04:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to uh potentially fatal
 
04:25:46.590 --> 04:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
infectious diseases um so in closing so
 
04:25:48.469 --> 04:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
clinical trials are governed by strict
 
04:25:50.630 --> 04:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
regulatory oversight um robust
 
04:25:52.590 --> 04:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
methodology Bound by strong ethical
 
04:25:54.550 --> 04:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
guard rails and driven by sound
 
04:25:57.109 --> 04:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
scientific reasoning um to suggest that
 
04:25:59.429 --> 04:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
we deviate from this framework um to put
 
04:26:02.429 --> 04:26:02.439 align:start position:0%
an unrealistic and unscientific uh
 
04:26:04.630 --> 04:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
requirement that a saline Placebo be
 
04:26:07.109 --> 04:26:07.119 align:start position:0%
used when it's not appropriate to do so
 
04:26:09.830 --> 04:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
would make trials actually less safe um
 
04:26:11.750 --> 04:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
so this bill creates a problem that
 
04:26:13.830 --> 04:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist in order to further limit
 
04:26:16.469 --> 04:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
access to vaccines which are critical to
 
04:26:18.149 --> 04:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
keeping our community safe especially
 
04:26:19.990 --> 04:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
our children thank you so thank you very
 
04:26:23.269 --> 04:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
much representative Maser thank you Mr
 
04:26:25.469 --> 04:26:25.479 align:start position:0%
chair are you taking questions
 
04:26:28.870 --> 04:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
or excuse oh sorry yeah I'll take
 
04:26:30.910 --> 04:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
04:26:33.229 --> 04:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
question so what vaccines would be
 
04:26:38.109 --> 04:26:38.119 align:start position:0%
revoked if this bill passes um so I have
 
04:26:40.349 --> 04:26:40.359 align:start position:0%
some some expertise on vaccines but less
 
04:26:42.590 --> 04:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
so in legislation uh this this is my
 
04:26:45.030 --> 04:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
first time here so I think in my reading
 
04:26:47.149 --> 04:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
of the bill if I'm reading it literally
 
04:26:49.870 --> 04:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
that this would essentially eliminate uh
 
04:26:53.510 --> 04:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
all vaccines um on the existing schedule
 
04:26:56.189 --> 04:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
because um you know to Dr Chan's point
 
04:26:58.950 --> 04:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
they were initially studied using an
 
04:27:02.309 --> 04:27:02.319 align:start position:0%
iner Placebo saline um but then because
 
04:27:04.149 --> 04:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
we are in the circumstance in the year
 
04:27:07.149 --> 04:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
2025 where we have safe and effective
 
04:27:09.229 --> 04:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
vaccines that have been backed up at
 
04:27:12.149 --> 04:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
clinical trials we are often improve
 
04:27:14.309 --> 04:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
proving them or putting new formulations
 
04:27:17.109 --> 04:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
on the market for example um it's always
 
04:27:20.389 --> 04:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
a goal to reduce reactogenicity of a
 
04:27:23.950 --> 04:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine so less than the side effects so
 
04:27:27.149 --> 04:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
um you know if you develop a new MMR
 
04:27:29.870 --> 04:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine measel boms rebella vaccine you
 
04:27:31.750 --> 04:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
want to have less side effects you would
 
04:27:34.990 --> 04:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
need to test that formulation against
 
04:27:37.550 --> 04:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
the existing uh vaccine that is
 
04:27:39.710 --> 04:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
available on the market because you
 
04:27:44.670 --> 04:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
cannot create a study where you would um
 
04:27:47.830 --> 04:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
put use a saline Placebo in a cohort of
 
04:27:50.229 --> 04:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
children and leave them vulnerable to
 
04:27:52.670 --> 04:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
measles which as we know you know can be
 
04:27:55.269 --> 04:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
fatal but can also have lifelong result
 
04:27:57.630 --> 04:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
in lifelong disabilities
 
04:28:00.269 --> 04:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
so any else and sorry it would
 
04:28:01.830 --> 04:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
effectively I believe eliminate the flu
 
04:28:04.990 --> 04:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine as well because um you know
 
04:28:07.469 --> 04:28:07.479 align:start position:0%
someone um maybe representative uh Woods
 
04:28:09.349 --> 04:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
earlier asked about variance or maybe it
 
04:28:12.229 --> 04:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
was representative
 
04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
missing up um someone had asked about
 
04:28:15.469 --> 04:28:15.479 align:start position:0%
variant I think it would it would
 
04:28:17.550 --> 04:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
eliminate the flu vaccine as well
 
04:28:20.229 --> 04:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
because um immuno bridging studies are
 
04:28:22.990 --> 04:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
done each year to pick the flu strains
 
04:28:25.030 --> 04:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
actually it should be going on now uh
 
04:28:28.229 --> 04:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
for next Falls flu vaccine you pick the
 
04:28:29.469 --> 04:28:29.479 align:start position:0%
strains that you want to immunize
 
04:28:32.109 --> 04:28:32.119 align:start position:0%
against and use the existing vaccines as
 
04:28:34.590 --> 04:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
a comparator so we would essentially
 
04:28:37.429 --> 04:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
after a very deadly influenza year be
 
04:28:39.710 --> 04:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
potentially without a flu vaccine for
 
04:28:44.429 --> 04:28:44.439 align:start position:0%
next year if this bill to pass thank you
 
04:28:45.590 --> 04:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
04:28:48.429 --> 04:28:48.439 align:start position:0%
representative representative mlan thank
 
04:28:49.910 --> 04:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:28:52.750 --> 04:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
question um are you aware like from a
 
04:28:55.750 --> 04:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework or anything of any
 
04:28:59.710 --> 04:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines that are being approved where
 
04:29:02.830 --> 04:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
the history of the control does not lead
 
04:29:05.030 --> 04:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
back to an inert Placebo or as you
 
04:29:08.149 --> 04:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
mention the second type where I have
 
04:29:10.030 --> 04:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
essentially all of the ingredients
 
04:29:12.429 --> 04:29:12.439 align:start position:0%
except the inactive component are you
 
04:29:15.830 --> 04:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
aware of controls where in the history
 
04:29:17.070 --> 04:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
that does not
 
04:29:20.670 --> 04:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
exist I am not aware and in fact um
 
04:29:23.750 --> 04:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
after Dr Chan uh testified I uh looked
 
04:29:26.309 --> 04:29:26.319 align:start position:0%
up and made sure that um the initial
 
04:29:28.189 --> 04:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
vaccines of the following were all
 
04:29:30.070 --> 04:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
tested against a placebo in their
 
04:29:32.469 --> 04:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
initial init initial trial uh the
 
04:29:35.469 --> 04:29:35.479 align:start position:0%
rubella vaccine the pacle vaccine the
 
04:29:38.710 --> 04:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
Hib vaccine for hemophilus influenza B
 
04:29:41.389 --> 04:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
the HPV vaccine the so polio vaccine the
 
04:29:42.790 --> 04:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
measles vaccine
 
04:29:46.149 --> 04:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
Tdap um vaccine and the covid vaccine
 
04:29:48.670 --> 04:29:48.680 align:start position:0%
all against uh inert saling placebos to
 
04:29:51.550 --> 04:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
establish their first safety
 
04:29:55.590 --> 04:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
trials any any final questions see
 
04:29:57.389 --> 04:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
representative merer yeah thank you
 
04:29:59.109 --> 04:29:59.119 align:start position:0%
again so would you believe that this
 
04:30:01.149 --> 04:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
bill is only about mandating vaccines
 
04:30:03.830 --> 04:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
and not vaccine
 
04:30:06.790 --> 04:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
availability I believe that this bill is
 
04:30:11.269 --> 04:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
intended to um create an impossible
 
04:30:14.510 --> 04:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
standard uh that no vaccine currently
 
04:30:17.710 --> 04:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
available could meet uh which would lead
 
04:30:22.429 --> 04:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
to access um limited access um and as we
 
04:30:26.590 --> 04:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
know um as vaccine coverage
 
04:30:30.149 --> 04:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
Falls infectious diseases come roaring
 
04:30:34.670 --> 04:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
back so for example a community needs a
 
04:30:37.790 --> 04:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
95% uptake rate of the MMR vaccine in
 
04:30:40.229 --> 04:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
order to PR prevent measles outbreaks
 
04:30:42.349 --> 04:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
and once coverage Falls below that
 
04:30:45.550 --> 04:30:45.560 align:start position:0%
whether it is just from organic vaccine
 
04:30:49.870 --> 04:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
hesitancy um or a lack of access to
 
04:30:52.149 --> 04:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
vaccines you will start to see uh
 
04:30:54.109 --> 04:30:54.119 align:start position:0%
measles come back and we're seeing that
 
04:30:56.950 --> 04:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
happen in real time right now thank you
 
04:31:02.790 --> 04:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:05.389 --> 04:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Melissa
 
04:31:15.510 --> 04:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:17.189 --> 04:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thanks for having us here
 
04:31:22.030 --> 04:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
today um I'm here as a mom and I suppose
 
04:31:25.030 --> 04:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
since no one else was able to make it
 
04:31:28.429 --> 04:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
other moms um I'm I'm representing the
 
04:31:30.309 --> 04:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
other moms that couldn't make it um we
 
04:31:32.149 --> 04:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
don't have a lobbyist we don't have
 
04:31:34.630 --> 04:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
anyone to represent us like the moneyed
 
04:31:37.189 --> 04:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
interests that are here so um I happen
 
04:31:39.229 --> 04:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
to be on vacation this week so that's
 
04:31:44.590 --> 04:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
why I get to be here um so um the 1986
 
04:31:47.309 --> 04:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
Act was already mentioned that took away
 
04:31:50.870 --> 04:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
um liability from vaccine
 
04:31:53.950 --> 04:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturers uh from the industry so if
 
04:31:55.510 --> 04:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
the federal government is going to keep
 
04:31:58.149 --> 04:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
that law in place we as a population and
 
04:32:01.229 --> 04:32:01.239 align:start position:0%
we moms must demand that no corners ever
 
04:32:02.870 --> 04:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
be cut when it comes to the health and
 
04:32:06.950 --> 04:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
safety of our children um I do have
 
04:32:09.349 --> 04:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
several friends who have vaccine injured
 
04:32:12.349 --> 04:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
children um and it's not
 
04:32:14.990 --> 04:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
just you know a couple days or a week of
 
04:32:17.469 --> 04:32:17.479 align:start position:0%
a little rash and a fever it's like you
 
04:32:20.149 --> 04:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
know my friend's 21-year-old son is
 
04:32:23.149 --> 04:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
still not talking and he can use the
 
04:32:25.269 --> 04:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
bathroom but he still wears a diaper
 
04:32:29.670 --> 04:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
just in case um but um to that end this
 
04:32:32.109 --> 04:32:32.119 align:start position:0%
bill is not about removing any shots
 
04:32:34.870 --> 04:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
from the schedule it's just taking away
 
04:32:37.830 --> 04:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
the mandates that you know so parents
 
04:32:40.990 --> 04:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
will have a choice if they choose and
 
04:32:44.070 --> 04:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
what I've read even recently um I don't
 
04:32:45.950 --> 04:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
I didn't mark the study down because I
 
04:32:47.309 --> 04:32:47.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't planning to be here today
 
04:32:50.070 --> 04:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily but um there's literally I
 
04:32:53.309 --> 04:32:53.319 align:start position:0%
think it's 1% or maybe 1% of the entire
 
04:32:55.429 --> 04:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
population of our country that is
 
04:32:59.030 --> 04:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
choosing not to vaccinate so you've got
 
04:33:01.309 --> 04:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
your 95% you've got your
 
04:33:05.949 --> 04:33:05.959 align:start position:0%
99% um most people are vaccinating so
 
04:33:08.429 --> 04:33:08.439 align:start position:0%
just not having a mandate is not
 
04:33:14.510 --> 04:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
removing them from from the choice um so
 
04:33:17.590 --> 04:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
um I think I think that's it I just just
 
04:33:19.949 --> 04:33:19.959 align:start position:0%
wanted to say those few things so thank
 
04:33:22.551 --> 04:33:22.561 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions
 
04:33:22.561 --> 04:33:24.470 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions
representative

04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:33:26.590 --> 04:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
delus thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:33:28.709 --> 04:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so do you
 
04:33:31.750 --> 04:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
believe that yourself and your the rest
 
04:33:34.830 --> 04:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
of the moms that you refer to would have
 
04:33:36.070 --> 04:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
chosen to
 
04:33:39.470 --> 04:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
vaccinate anyway at first or how you
 
04:33:42.349 --> 04:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
feel um the ones I know a lot of moms
 
04:33:45.670 --> 04:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
who well people like to call people
 
04:33:48.029 --> 04:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
antivaxers if they don't vaccinate but
 
04:33:50.150 --> 04:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
usually they're ex vaxers they're
 
04:33:52.310 --> 04:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
they're not anti they they did the shots
 
04:33:55.510 --> 04:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
and they were injured um I don't know
 
04:33:57.429 --> 04:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I guess I'll speak for myself
 
04:34:01.310 --> 04:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
but I was fully vaccinated growing up um
 
04:34:03.990 --> 04:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
I'm in my 50s now and I have several
 
04:34:07.269 --> 04:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
autoimmune challenges um those aren't
 
04:34:10.349 --> 04:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
studied because and fouchy himself said
 
04:34:12.390 --> 04:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
that you know back back when we were you
 
04:34:14.470 --> 04:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
know he was defending the lack of
 
04:34:16.910 --> 04:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
studies on the actually I think it was
 
04:34:19.709 --> 04:34:19.719 align:start position:0%
even before I think it was several many
 
04:34:21.750 --> 04:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
years ago maybe 10 years ago maybe the
 
04:34:25.670 --> 04:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
H1N1 shot or whatever that 2009
 
04:34:28.551 --> 04:34:28.561 align:start position:0%
pandemic Panic was about um he was
 
04:34:30.429 --> 04:34:30.439 align:start position:0%
saying oh no we have to study these for
 
04:34:32.349 --> 04:34:32.359 align:start position:0%
years because you just never know like
 
04:34:34.869 --> 04:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
what's going to pop up later and it's a
 
04:34:37.029 --> 04:34:37.039 align:start position:0%
challenge I mean I eat
 
04:34:40.150 --> 04:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
perfectly I I my whole life is wrapped
 
04:34:43.150 --> 04:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
around my health because my body just
 
04:34:46.390 --> 04:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
can't handle things and not everybody is
 
04:34:49.150 --> 04:34:49.160 align:start position:0%
like that but that's you know there's
 
04:34:50.990 --> 04:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
different different things that go on in
 
04:34:52.869 --> 04:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
us and so we're all different and you
 
04:34:54.789 --> 04:34:54.799 align:start position:0%
can some people can take a flu shot
 
04:34:57.070 --> 04:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
every year and I would probably die if I
 
04:35:03.310 --> 04:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:06.670 --> 04:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
yeah also signed up to speak is klen fer
 
04:35:07.869 --> 04:35:07.879 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Nurses
 
04:35:07.879 --> 04:35:19.470 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Nurses
Association

04:35:19.470 --> 04:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:21.670 --> 04:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chair McDonald and
 
04:35:23.830 --> 04:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
04:35:26.670 --> 04:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
committee I'm sharing testimony today on
 
04:35:29.830 --> 04:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
behalf of TW over 1250 nurses who are
 
04:35:32.109 --> 04:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
members of the New Hampshire Nurses
 
04:35:34.470 --> 04:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
Association our mission is to improve
 
04:35:36.029 --> 04:35:36.039 align:start position:0%
the health of the people of New
 
04:35:39.070 --> 04:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a nurse for over 36 years
 
04:35:41.750 --> 04:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
serving in multiple Public Health roles
 
04:35:44.670 --> 04:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
I have witnessed the societal benefit of
 
04:35:48.070 --> 04:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccinations in preventing de
 
04:35:51.109 --> 04:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
disease and death vaccines help children
 
04:35:53.830 --> 04:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
grow free from preventable disease
 
04:35:57.310 --> 04:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
decrease hospitalizations and save money
 
04:35:59.869 --> 04:35:59.879 align:start position:0%
as you know vaccinations are one of the
 
04:36:01.629 --> 04:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
greatest Public Health achievements of
 
04:36:03.189 --> 04:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
the 20th
 
04:36:06.750 --> 04:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
century sadly vaccine hency is leading
 
04:36:09.629 --> 04:36:09.639 align:start position:0%
to lower vaccination rates and this
 
04:36:11.590 --> 04:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation will only EX
 
04:36:14.709 --> 04:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
exacerbate the problem research shows
 
04:36:17.670 --> 04:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
that children living in or near poverty
 
04:36:19.869 --> 04:36:19.879 align:start position:0%
experience persistently lower
 
04:36:22.189 --> 04:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates making them
 
04:36:24.670 --> 04:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
disproportionately at risk for vaccine
 
04:36:24.680 --> 04:36:25.910 align:start position:0%
disproportionately at risk for vaccine
preventable

04:36:25.910 --> 04:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
preventable
 
04:36:28.910 --> 04:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
diseases this bill provides that
 
04:36:30.910 --> 04:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
childhood immunization requirements
 
04:36:33.189 --> 04:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
shall not require a vaccine that has not
 
04:36:35.910 --> 04:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
been tested with an inert Placebo in
 
04:36:39.429 --> 04:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
clinical trials in fact most childhood
 
04:36:42.150 --> 04:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
immunizations have not re recently been
 
04:36:44.869 --> 04:36:44.879 align:start position:0%
tested with an inner Placebo because it
 
04:36:47.869 --> 04:36:47.879 align:start position:0%
would be unethical most childhood
 
04:36:49.789 --> 04:36:49.799 align:start position:0%
immunizations have been available for
 
04:36:52.629 --> 04:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
more than 50 years therefore clinical
 
04:36:55.709 --> 04:36:55.719 align:start position:0%
equipoise is an absolute standard that
 
04:36:58.830 --> 04:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
requires participants in clinical trials
 
04:37:00.910 --> 04:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
to receive at least the existing
 
04:37:03.750 --> 04:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
standard of care a placebo controlled
 
04:37:06.709 --> 04:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
clinical trial is Justified only when no
 
04:37:09.189 --> 04:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
safe effective vaccine exists for the
 
04:37:11.830 --> 04:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
disease for the safety of New Hampshire
 
04:37:14.390 --> 04:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
children their families and communities
 
04:37:18.789 --> 04:37:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:22.830 --> 04:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
664 thank you any
 
04:37:25.429 --> 04:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative
 
04:37:27.830 --> 04:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
Drew you stated in your testimony that
 
04:37:29.590 --> 04:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
you've seen the effectiveness of
 
04:37:32.869 --> 04:37:32.879 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccines have you seen the
 
04:37:35.830 --> 04:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
adverse effects of childhood vaccines
 
04:37:38.390 --> 04:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
have you dealt with that in your work at
 
04:37:42.189 --> 04:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
all I have not um
 
04:37:44.269 --> 04:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
early on in my career I worked in a
 
04:37:47.109 --> 04:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
federally qualif qualified Health Center
 
04:37:49.990 --> 04:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
um which was an outpatient Primary Care
 
04:37:52.709 --> 04:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
Health Center and we gave many many
 
04:37:55.070 --> 04:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines daily we were required to
 
04:37:58.109 --> 04:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
report as was mentioned earlier in the v
 
04:38:00.910 --> 04:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
system and during the time that I was
 
04:38:05.109 --> 04:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
there I never saw any V vaccine Adverse
 
04:38:07.990 --> 04:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
Events okay any other
 
04:38:14.189 --> 04:38:14.199 align:start position:0%

664 as a pharmacist I am deeply
 
04:39:00.109 --> 04:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
concerned about this bill to be frank it
 
04:39:02.551 --> 04:39:02.561 align:start position:0%
is a direct attack on the lives and
 
04:39:05.269 --> 04:39:05.279 align:start position:0%

review of these same vaccine package

inserts readily available on daily Med
 
04:40:17.948 --> 04:40:17.958 align:start position:0%

explicitly required under RSA 141c col

20-a were not evaluated clinically with
 
04:40:28.190 --> 04:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
Placebo controlled trials do you suppose
 
04:40:30.470 --> 04:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
that this is a coincidence you may ask
 
04:40:32.150 --> 04:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
yourself why these trials were not
 
04:40:34.550 --> 04:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
Placebo controlled you may also be
 
04:40:36.948 --> 04:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
wondering what a package insert is or
 
04:40:39.910 --> 04:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
what daily met is package inserts are
 
04:40:42.670 --> 04:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
documents required by the FD day to
 
04:40:44.350 --> 04:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
provide detailed information about
 
04:40:47.310 --> 04:40:47.320 align:start position:0%
prescription medications daily Med is an
 
04:40:50.948 --> 04:40:50.958 align:start position:0%
invaluable nah run website that I use
 
04:40:53.788 --> 04:40:53.798 align:start position:0%
nearly daily at work to quickly find
 
04:40:56.670 --> 04:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
specific medication information this may
 
04:40:58.708 --> 04:40:58.718 align:start position:0%
be a good point to reflect on your own
 
04:41:01.708 --> 04:41:01.718 align:start position:0%
knowledge of medicine physiology
 
04:41:05.070 --> 04:41:05.080 align:start position:0%
microbiology and Immunology it is not
 
04:41:07.788 --> 04:41:07.798 align:start position:0%
whatsoever the scientific custom to use
 
04:41:11.350 --> 04:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
a placebo for a vaccine trial it is UN
 
04:41:13.628 --> 04:41:13.638 align:start position:0%
ethical to do so especially when
 
04:41:15.708 --> 04:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
alternative vaccines are already
 
04:41:17.990 --> 04:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
available which is the case for all
 
04:41:23.350 --> 04:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
seven vaccines listed in RSA 141c 20-a
 
04:41:25.350 --> 04:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
not every clinical trial needs to be
 
04:41:29.110 --> 04:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
Placebo controlled to be scientifically
 
04:41:32.070 --> 04:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
sound finishing up this bill aims to
 
04:41:34.350 --> 04:41:34.360 align:start position:0%
completely upend Children's Health and
 
04:41:36.470 --> 04:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
Public Health in the state and to render
 
04:41:42.510 --> 04:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
RSA 141 d c 20-a useless the passage of
 
04:41:45.230 --> 04:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
this bill will result in preventable
 
04:41:48.110 --> 04:41:48.120 align:start position:0%

04:42:01.510 --> 04:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
much also signed up to speak is Dr Gary
 
04:42:09.750 --> 04:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:21.990 --> 04:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:24.270 --> 04:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
Sir Mr chair and members of the
 
04:42:26.190 --> 04:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Gary yor I live in
 
04:42:27.550 --> 04:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
Hopkinson New
 
04:42:29.590 --> 04:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh have a background in
 
04:42:32.270 --> 04:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
science I consider myself a scientist of
 
04:42:35.670 --> 04:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
sorts uh my interest in vaccine safety
 
04:42:38.190 --> 04:42:38.200 align:start position:0%
uh started about 40 year ago years ago
 
04:42:41.470 --> 04:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
when my son had a severe reaction to the
 
04:42:45.030 --> 04:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
TPT shot uh probably the
 
04:42:47.270 --> 04:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
protest necessitating a medical
 
04:42:51.910 --> 04:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
exemption for a him and and future uh
 
04:42:54.110 --> 04:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
siblings uh to be clear I'm not an
 
04:42:57.070 --> 04:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
expert in the field of vaccine safety I
 
04:42:58.830 --> 04:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
I would guess that there's no one in
 
04:43:01.190 --> 04:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
this room or probably in the state that
 
04:43:03.868 --> 04:43:03.878 align:start position:0%
is qualified as or considered an a
 
04:43:06.868 --> 04:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
vaccine safety expert I would argue that
 
04:43:09.990 --> 04:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
the uh qualifications ought to include
 
04:43:13.510 --> 04:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
like a PhD and immun ology to start
 
04:43:16.830 --> 04:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
with uh in medical school uh the amount
 
04:43:20.110 --> 04:43:20.120 align:start position:0%
of time we had uh training under
 
04:43:22.070 --> 04:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
information about vaccines were zero
 
04:43:24.628 --> 04:43:24.638 align:start position:0%
hours zero minutes it wasn't many years
 
04:43:24.638 --> 04:43:27.230 align:start position:0%
hours zero minutes it wasn't many years
ago

04:43:27.230 --> 04:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:29.590 --> 04:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
nonetheless uh it was only five years
 
04:43:31.990 --> 04:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
ago in the midst of the covid thing that
 
04:43:35.470 --> 04:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
um the timely book that Miss Evans has
 
04:43:38.590 --> 04:43:38.600 align:start position:0%
referenced the turtles all the way down
 
04:43:41.070 --> 04:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
talking about safety I was so Aston
 
04:43:43.708 --> 04:43:43.718 align:start position:0%
wanted to find out that uh the current
 
04:43:46.110 --> 04:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine schedule uh none have been
 
04:43:48.350 --> 04:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
tested against a
 
04:43:51.750 --> 04:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
placebo uh it seemed uh crazy that you
 
04:43:54.990 --> 04:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
would inject substance into somebody
 
04:43:56.910 --> 04:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
that isn't tested against the placebo
 
04:43:58.708 --> 04:43:58.718 align:start position:0%
and by
 
04:44:01.110 --> 04:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
Placebo uh I want to just remind
 
04:44:03.430 --> 04:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
everyone that is the gold standard for
 
04:44:07.150 --> 04:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
testing and whether it be a drug Placebo
 
04:44:09.310 --> 04:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
being a sugar pill or an
 
04:44:13.628 --> 04:44:13.638 align:start position:0%
injected uh uh injection would be uh uh
 
04:44:16.788 --> 04:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
normal saline something like
 
04:44:21.030 --> 04:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
that uh I also want to uh uh clarify
 
04:44:24.110 --> 04:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
that um some of the studies that have
 
04:44:28.270 --> 04:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
been done uh relying on uh
 
04:44:31.350 --> 04:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
either previous iterations of the
 
04:44:35.510 --> 04:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine or uh
 
04:44:39.708 --> 04:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
um another type of vaccine as a control
 
04:44:44.230 --> 04:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
group is is flawed in that the the the
 
04:44:48.310 --> 04:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
goal of Cl clinical trial trials is to
 
04:44:50.948 --> 04:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
determine that there's no significant
 
04:44:50.958 --> 04:44:52.470 align:start position:0%
determine that there's no significant
statistically

04:44:52.470 --> 04:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
statistically
 
04:44:55.390 --> 04:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
significant difference between the
 
04:44:58.390 --> 04:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
control group and the trial group so if
 
04:45:02.070 --> 04:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
you're using the previous iteration of a
 
04:45:04.670 --> 04:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine against the current
 
04:45:06.910 --> 04:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
iteration you're you're looking at
 
04:45:09.750 --> 04:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
differences in in adverse reactions say
 
04:45:12.628 --> 04:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
there's 10% reaction ctions in the
 
04:45:12.638 --> 04:45:13.708 align:start position:0%
there's 10% reaction ctions in the
previous

04:45:13.708 --> 04:45:13.718 align:start position:0%
previous
 
04:45:15.788 --> 04:45:15.798 align:start position:0%
iteration and there's
 
04:45:19.910 --> 04:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
12% uh certain adverse reaction let's
 
04:45:22.550 --> 04:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
call it uh a seizures or something uh
 
04:45:26.390 --> 04:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
for discussion uh you
 
04:45:30.030 --> 04:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
can't 10% versus 12% may be not
 
04:45:33.430 --> 04:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
significant but 10% versus 0% that is a
 
04:45:36.948 --> 04:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
true Placebo is significant and please
 
04:45:38.390 --> 04:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
stop wrapping
 
04:45:42.670 --> 04:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:45.110 --> 04:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh I have hard time with the concept
 
04:45:47.470 --> 04:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:45:51.230 --> 04:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh Placebo issue is unethical uh
 
04:45:52.628 --> 04:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
certainly there are families here that
 
04:45:55.310 --> 04:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
don't vaccinate their children for
 
04:45:59.350 --> 04:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
obvious reasons um also any form of
 
04:46:02.910 --> 04:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
mandate is against all my principles uh
 
04:46:05.230 --> 04:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense to have and we're
 
04:46:07.030 --> 04:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
talking and this bill addresses a
 
04:46:09.750 --> 04:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
mandated vaccine not just all vaccines
 
04:46:12.110 --> 04:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
as someone had said said
 
04:46:15.230 --> 04:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
before um so uh I'm I'm going to pass
 
04:46:18.030 --> 04:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
out at the end just um a summary of the
 
04:46:22.270 --> 04:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
book and you can look at it sure and uh
 
04:46:25.390 --> 04:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
be curious if you like to and Fe look at
 
04:46:28.070 --> 04:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
what the other side has to say uh I know
 
04:46:30.548 --> 04:46:30.558 align:start position:0%
it's hard to wrap our uh wrap our brains
 
04:46:32.708 --> 04:46:32.718 align:start position:0%
around things that we've believed to be
 
04:46:37.110 --> 04:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
true for so long uh the Flat Earth ET
 
04:46:38.548 --> 04:46:38.558 align:start position:0%
any questions for this gentleman yeah
 
04:46:41.708 --> 04:46:41.718 align:start position:0%
representative Damas
 
04:46:43.030 --> 04:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:46:45.868 --> 04:46:45.878 align:start position:0%
taking my question just briefly um do
 
04:46:49.270 --> 04:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
you believe that the uh vaccine act may
 
04:46:51.910 --> 04:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
have directly caused what we're dealing
 
04:46:51.920 --> 04:46:53.430 align:start position:0%
have directly caused what we're dealing
with

04:46:53.430 --> 04:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:46:55.548 --> 04:46:55.558 align:start position:0%
currently in that in that there's no
 
04:46:58.150 --> 04:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
liability for any vaccine companies that
 
04:47:00.910 --> 04:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
produce vaccines at this stage most
 
04:47:04.510 --> 04:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
certainly and you know big farmer big
 
04:47:07.948 --> 04:47:07.958 align:start position:0%
profit uh no liability what's wrong with
 
04:47:07.958 --> 04:47:08.868 align:start position:0%
profit uh no liability what's wrong with
that

04:47:08.868 --> 04:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:47:12.750 --> 04:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
picture thank you anyway else seeing no
 
04:47:21.350 --> 04:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:25.310 --> 04:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Louise
 
04:47:35.470 --> 04:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:39.190 --> 04:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
Street no red button there we go uh
 
04:47:41.548 --> 04:47:41.558 align:start position:0%
thank you hi Mr chair um um thank you
 
04:47:43.910 --> 04:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my testimony and to the
 
04:47:45.230 --> 04:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for taking my
 
04:47:47.868 --> 04:47:47.878 align:start position:0%
testimony my name is Louise Spencer I'm
 
04:47:50.110 --> 04:47:50.120 align:start position:0%
from conquered New Hampshire and I'm
 
04:47:53.548 --> 04:47:53.558 align:start position:0%
here today as a mother and a grandmother
 
04:47:57.628 --> 04:47:57.638 align:start position:0%
and also um representing the members of
 
04:47:59.548 --> 04:47:59.558 align:start position:0%
Kent Street Coalition which is an all
 
04:48:02.548 --> 04:48:02.558 align:start position:0%
volunteer Grassroots advocacy
 
04:48:05.868 --> 04:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
organization and the overwhelming number
 
04:48:08.948 --> 04:48:08.958 align:start position:0%
of our members who oppose not only this
 
04:48:12.548 --> 04:48:12.558 align:start position:0%
bill but also um the next bill HB
 
04:48:18.230 --> 04:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
679 my testimony I applies to both um of
 
04:48:20.868 --> 04:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
these bills as does my opposition
 
04:48:23.070 --> 04:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
because these two bills when taken
 
04:48:26.390 --> 04:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
together really um seem to be aimed at
 
04:48:29.788 --> 04:48:29.798 align:start position:0%
making it um nearly impossible to
 
04:48:33.310 --> 04:48:33.320 align:start position:0%
enforce any sort of uh vaccine
 
04:48:38.470 --> 04:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
requirements um and um my heart does go
 
04:48:41.470 --> 04:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
out to the parents and especially to the
 
04:48:44.350 --> 04:48:44.360 align:start position:0%
children that may have been injured by a
 
04:48:46.548 --> 04:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
vaccine and and we know that is possible
 
04:48:50.990 --> 04:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
and compensation should be available um
 
04:48:53.750 --> 04:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
but also I'm aware of the harm that
 
04:48:57.310 --> 04:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
comes to children that are uh not yet
 
04:49:00.788 --> 04:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and exposed to those who are
 
04:49:04.990 --> 04:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated or in not fully vaccinated
 
04:49:09.590 --> 04:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
my daughter at four or 5 months old uh
 
04:49:13.470 --> 04:49:13.480 align:start position:0%
developed W who cough and uh it became a
 
04:49:17.628 --> 04:49:17.638 align:start position:0%
very dangerous situation acutely uh
 
04:49:21.548 --> 04:49:21.558 align:start position:0%
where she um could not catch her breath
 
04:49:24.390 --> 04:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
where she um I guess babies sometimes
 
04:49:27.510 --> 04:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
stroke out I could see the the veins in
 
04:49:32.310 --> 04:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
her head in a very scary way um but she
 
04:49:35.948 --> 04:49:35.958 align:start position:0%
lived with the squilla of that infection
 
04:49:38.150 --> 04:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
for years she developed a coughing
 
04:49:40.910 --> 04:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
asthma and had to use nebulizers and
 
04:49:43.670 --> 04:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
really out only outgrew that in her 20s
 
04:49:47.110 --> 04:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
so there are harms that we know of that
 
04:49:49.270 --> 04:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
come from children being exposed to
 
04:49:49.280 --> 04:49:50.548 align:start position:0%
come from children being exposed to
preventable

04:49:50.548 --> 04:49:50.558 align:start position:0%
preventable
 
04:49:53.670 --> 04:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
diseases um right now I have a
 
04:49:57.190 --> 04:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
9-month-old grandson he is not yet
 
04:50:01.150 --> 04:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
available to get the um measles vaccine
 
04:50:04.628 --> 04:50:04.638 align:start position:0%
and it's very scary to have a
 
04:50:08.150 --> 04:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated child when measles I
 
04:50:11.190 --> 04:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
believe it's like a one one person with
 
04:50:13.910 --> 04:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
measles can infect 28 people whereas
 
04:50:18.708 --> 04:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
covid it's one to four and the the virus
 
04:50:20.708 --> 04:50:20.718 align:start position:0%
apparently hangs in the air for two
 
04:50:22.670 --> 04:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
hours I've been reading about measles
 
04:50:24.948 --> 04:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
because I'm also very concerned about my
 
04:50:27.750 --> 04:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
grandchild uh her practice her
 
04:50:30.628 --> 04:50:30.638 align:start position:0%
pediatrician is considering lowering the
 
04:50:34.390 --> 04:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
age um from one year to 9 months because
 
04:50:37.150 --> 04:50:37.160 align:start position:0%
of their very deep concern about the
 
04:50:40.830 --> 04:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
measles so I speak as a parent as speak
 
04:50:44.150 --> 04:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
as a grandparent I am not a lobbyist I
 
04:50:45.350 --> 04:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
am not with big
 
04:50:48.230 --> 04:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
Pharma and I understand these are
 
04:50:50.910 --> 04:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
difficult issues but I really think that
 
04:50:53.948 --> 04:50:53.958 align:start position:0%
we need to protect the community and our
 
04:50:56.910 --> 04:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
children at large so thank you thank you
 
04:50:56.920 --> 04:50:58.310 align:start position:0%
children at large so thank you thank you
any

04:50:58.310 --> 04:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:51:02.470 --> 04:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you so just to
 
04:51:06.708 --> 04:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
clarify um I I also am opposed to the
 
04:51:09.390 --> 04:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
next bill but can this testimony serve
 
04:51:13.310 --> 04:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
to cover both uh well we've got your the
 
04:51:15.390 --> 04:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
clerk taking notes so that that can be
 
04:51:17.070 --> 04:51:17.080 align:start position:0%
part of his notes okay so maybe I should
 
04:51:21.110 --> 04:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
put the the um other bill on the card um
 
04:51:23.030 --> 04:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
or does it matter it doesn't matter okay
 
04:51:25.670 --> 04:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
do okay thank you so much thank you no
 
04:51:29.590 --> 04:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
one else has signed up to testify on HB
 
04:51:32.230 --> 04:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
664a I'm afraid to ask does anybody else
 
04:51:35.230 --> 04:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
want to testify seeing none um I'm going
 
04:51:36.910 --> 04:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
to close that public hearing and open
 
04:51:39.110 --> 04:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
the public hearing for HB
 
04:51:41.948 --> 04:51:41.958 align:start position:0%
679 uh the Prime sponsor is in the room
 
04:51:43.708 --> 04:51:43.718 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly
 
04:51:47.310 --> 04:51:47.320 align:start position:0%
Penza and and uh representative Penza we
 
04:51:50.990 --> 04:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:27.868 --> 04:52:27.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:43.590 --> 04:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:44.628 --> 04:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
me proceed when you're ready
 
04:52:47.030 --> 04:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair uh for
 
04:52:49.990 --> 04:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
the record um my name is representative
 
04:52:55.270 --> 04:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:58.990 --> 04:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
um so I'm here today to
 
04:53:01.510 --> 04:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
introduce what I consider a simple bill
 
04:53:05.390 --> 04:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
but um nobody else in this room will um
 
04:53:11.110 --> 04:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
is to add one line here which uh or
 
04:53:12.868 --> 04:53:12.878 align:start position:0%
actually becomes
 
04:53:17.990 --> 04:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
two um underneath RSA 141 C20 nothing in
 
04:53:20.948 --> 04:53:20.958 align:start position:0%
this section shall require a vaccine
 
04:53:25.070 --> 04:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
that has not been shown in um to prevent
 
04:53:25.080 --> 04:53:26.708 align:start position:0%
that has not been shown in um to prevent
transmission

04:53:26.708 --> 04:53:26.718 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
04:53:29.910 --> 04:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
so right now the list of vac vaccines
 
04:53:34.910 --> 04:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
that I know for um certain that do not
 
04:53:42.030 --> 04:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
prevent transmission are polio Hib and T
 
04:53:45.350 --> 04:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
um and if we are saying that vaccine
 
04:53:46.830 --> 04:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
mandates or
 
04:53:48.868 --> 04:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
requirements uh are in place for a
 
04:53:51.190 --> 04:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
community benefit when they cannot
 
04:53:54.430 --> 04:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
prevent transition uh transmission then
 
04:53:57.948 --> 04:53:57.958 align:start position:0%
there's no Community benefit it is a
 
04:54:00.990 --> 04:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
personal protective decision and we
 
04:54:03.590 --> 04:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
don't mandate any other personally
 
04:54:03.600 --> 04:54:05.150 align:start position:0%
don't mandate any other personally
protective

04:54:05.150 --> 04:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
protective
 
04:54:09.110 --> 04:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
medication so the argument um that is
 
04:54:12.030 --> 04:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
against mandating vaccines that do not
 
04:54:14.190 --> 04:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
prevent transmission for children
 
04:54:17.150 --> 04:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
revolve around these key points lack of
 
04:54:19.708 --> 04:54:19.718 align:start position:0%
public health justification the primary
 
04:54:22.310 --> 04:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
justification for vaccine mandates is to
 
04:54:23.830 --> 04:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
prevent the spread of infectious
 
04:54:25.510 --> 04:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
diseases and protect the broader
 
04:54:27.708 --> 04:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
Community if a vaccine does not
 
04:54:30.230 --> 04:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
significantly reduce transmission the
 
04:54:32.868 --> 04:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
public health benefit of mandating it
 
04:54:35.230 --> 04:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
diminishes individual risk benefit
 
04:54:37.430 --> 04:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
assessment when a vaccine primarily
 
04:54:39.350 --> 04:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
protects the individual rather than
 
04:54:41.590 --> 04:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
reducing community spread the decision
 
04:54:43.230 --> 04:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
to vaccinate should be left to parents
 
04:54:45.270 --> 04:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
and Guardians based on the child's
 
04:54:48.590 --> 04:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
specific Health needs and risk factors
 
04:54:51.590 --> 04:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
ethical and bodily autonomy
 
04:54:53.590 --> 04:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
concerns mandating a medical
 
04:54:55.708 --> 04:54:55.718 align:start position:0%
intervention especially for children
 
04:54:57.510 --> 04:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
raises ethical concerns when the
 
04:55:00.030 --> 04:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
intervention does not provide a direct
 
04:55:00.040 --> 04:55:01.270 align:start position:0%
intervention does not provide a direct
Community

04:55:01.270 --> 04:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
Community
 
04:55:03.390 --> 04:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
benefit parents should have the right to
 
04:55:04.708 --> 04:55:04.718 align:start position:0%
make medical decisions for their
 
04:55:07.070 --> 04:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
children when the choice does not
 
04:55:10.670 --> 04:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
significantly impact others
 
04:55:12.510 --> 04:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
potential side effects and unknown
 
04:55:15.190 --> 04:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
long-term risks even well- tested
 
04:55:18.190 --> 04:55:18.200 align:start position:0%
vaccines can have side effects and if
 
04:55:19.868 --> 04:55:19.878 align:start position:0%
they do not prevent
 
04:55:22.190 --> 04:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
transmission the argument for mandating
 
04:55:25.230 --> 04:55:25.240 align:start position:0%
them weakens further parents should be
 
04:55:27.030 --> 04:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
able to weigh potential risks and
 
04:55:28.990 --> 04:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
benefits without
 
04:55:31.830 --> 04:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
coercion erosion of public trust
 
04:55:33.788 --> 04:55:33.798 align:start position:0%
mandating vaccines that do not clearly
 
04:55:37.230 --> 04:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
contribute to hurt immunity uh
 
04:55:39.830 --> 04:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
undermine um trust in the public health
 
04:55:39.840 --> 04:55:40.750 align:start position:0%
undermine um trust in the public health
authori

04:55:40.750 --> 04:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
authori
 
04:55:43.910 --> 04:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
and future vaccine programs transparency
 
04:55:46.070 --> 04:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
and voluntary participation May
 
04:55:49.230 --> 04:55:49.240 align:start position:0%
encourage greater long-term trust and
 
04:55:51.150 --> 04:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
compliance and then of course
 
04:55:53.868 --> 04:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
alternative protective measures if a
 
04:55:56.390 --> 04:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine does not prevent spread other
 
04:55:59.150 --> 04:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
strategies treatments hygiene measures
 
04:56:00.868 --> 04:56:00.878 align:start position:0%
targeted protection for vulnerable
 
04:56:04.110 --> 04:56:04.120 align:start position:0%
populations may be more appropriate than
 
04:56:09.150 --> 04:56:09.160 align:start position:0%
mandates I passed out five different um
 
04:56:12.190 --> 04:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
pieces of information here of course I'm
 
04:56:15.510 --> 04:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
not going to go through these I wanted
 
04:56:17.990 --> 04:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
to um
 
04:56:22.708 --> 04:56:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:25.910 --> 04:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
pusas on the last page which would be it
 
04:56:28.310 --> 04:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
says 528 on here but it's the last page
 
04:56:30.628 --> 04:56:30.638 align:start position:0%
of the document under
 
04:56:32.990 --> 04:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
conclusions this is what's very
 
04:56:34.990 --> 04:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
important the effects of wholesale
 
04:56:37.310 --> 04:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
protestas vaccine wne after 5 to 10
 
04:56:39.788 --> 04:56:39.798 align:start position:0%
years the infection is in a vaccinated
 
04:56:42.110 --> 04:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
person causes non-specific symptoms
 
04:56:44.350 --> 04:56:44.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinated adolescents and adults may
 
04:56:47.110 --> 04:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
serve as reservoirs for silent infection
 
04:56:50.030 --> 04:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
and become potential transmitters to
 
04:56:52.470 --> 04:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
unprotective infants the whole cell
 
04:56:55.750 --> 04:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine for petasus is protective only
 
04:56:58.910 --> 04:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
against clinical disease not against
 
04:57:02.310 --> 04:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
infection therefore even young recently
 
04:57:05.070 --> 04:57:05.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinated children may serve as
 
04:57:07.910 --> 04:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
reservoirs and potential transmitters of
 
04:57:07.920 --> 04:57:10.990 align:start position:0%
reservoirs and potential transmitters of
infection

04:57:10.990 --> 04:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:11.000 --> 04:57:11.910 align:start position:0%
 
that's

04:57:11.910 --> 04:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:57:15.510 --> 04:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
huge why would we be mandating
 
04:57:18.470 --> 04:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
that in the other article here which
 
04:57:20.030 --> 04:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
talks and I never pronounced this
 
04:57:24.270 --> 04:57:24.280 align:start position:0%
correctly dpia dpia dpia maybe I did it
 
04:57:28.150 --> 04:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
um under uh right on the first page
 
04:57:31.670 --> 04:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
under the results vaccinated individuals
 
04:57:33.470 --> 04:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
can become colonized and transmit
 
04:57:35.708 --> 04:57:35.718 align:start position:0%
consequently vacillation alone can only
 
04:57:38.150 --> 04:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
interrupt Transmission in 28% of
 
04:57:40.910 --> 04:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
outbreak settings making isolation and
 
04:57:43.948 --> 04:57:43.958 align:start position:0%
antibiotics essential while antibiotics
 
04:57:46.110 --> 04:57:46.120 align:start position:0%
reduce the duration of infection they
 
04:57:49.788 --> 04:57:49.798 align:start position:0%
must be paired with diptheria deferia um
 
04:57:54.910 --> 04:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:54.920 --> 04:57:56.430 align:start position:0%
 
morbidity

04:57:56.430 --> 04:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
morbidity
 
04:58:01.548 --> 04:58:01.558 align:start position:0%
in polio now I want to preface this with
 
04:58:06.390 --> 04:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
um we are only using ipv here um in the
 
04:58:10.708 --> 04:58:10.718 align:start position:0%
states and so the document that I
 
04:58:14.830 --> 04:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
um I have two pieces here um this is a
 
04:58:16.510 --> 04:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
and I can send you guys this
 
04:58:21.310 --> 04:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
electronically so right here on um this
 
04:58:22.910 --> 04:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
document which is called polio the
 
04:58:25.830 --> 04:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
beginning of the end um the author is
 
04:58:29.510 --> 04:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
the World Health Organization it crystal
 
04:58:32.270 --> 04:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
clear in activated polio vaccine works
 
04:58:33.868 --> 04:58:33.878 align:start position:0%
by producing protective antibodies in
 
04:58:36.030 --> 04:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
the blood thus presenting the spread of
 
04:58:37.948 --> 04:58:37.958 align:start position:0%
polio to the central nervous system
 
04:58:40.270 --> 04:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
however it induces only very low
 
04:58:43.030 --> 04:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
immunity to polio virus inside the gut
 
04:58:45.070 --> 04:58:45.080 align:start position:0%
as a result it provides individual
 
04:58:48.070 --> 04:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
protection against polio paralysis but
 
04:58:50.390 --> 04:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
only marginally reduces the spread of
 
04:58:53.390 --> 04:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
wild polio virus in a person immunized
 
04:58:56.430 --> 04:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
with ipv Wild Virus can still multiply
 
04:58:58.548 --> 04:58:58.558 align:start position:0%
inside the intestines and be shed in
 
04:59:02.030 --> 04:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
stools because of this ipv could not be
 
04:59:07.150 --> 04:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
used to eradicate polio right here on um
 
04:59:11.350 --> 04:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
Poo's Global eradication ini itive
 
04:59:15.150 --> 04:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
website I made it big on that page right
 
04:59:19.030 --> 04:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
at the bottom it says however as ipv
 
04:59:22.030 --> 04:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
does not stop transmission of the virus
 
04:59:25.190 --> 04:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
opv is used wherever a polio outbreak
 
04:59:27.030 --> 04:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be contained even in countries
 
04:59:29.548 --> 04:59:29.558 align:start position:0%
which rely exclusively on ipv for their
 
04:59:32.390 --> 04:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
routine immunization program once polio
 
04:59:36.708 --> 04:59:36.718 align:start position:0%
has been um eradicated use of all opv
 
04:59:38.390 --> 04:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
will need to be stopped to prevent
 
04:59:40.628 --> 04:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
reestablishment of transmission Mission
 
04:59:43.868 --> 04:59:43.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:47.270 --> 04:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
vdpvs now these are real hard stories
 
04:59:49.670 --> 04:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
and if you are not familiar with them I
 
04:59:51.628 --> 04:59:51.638 align:start position:0%
just there's many that are out there I
 
04:59:55.310 --> 04:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
gave you guys two examples and um these
 
04:59:59.670 --> 04:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
are from a science um basically a
 
04:59:59.680 --> 05:00:04.430 align:start position:0%
are from a science um basically a
science

05:00:04.430 --> 05:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:04.440 --> 05:00:07.788 align:start position:0%
 
publication

05:00:07.788 --> 05:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:11.990 --> 05:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
so this was when um um they basically
 
05:00:13.150 --> 05:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
did an
 
05:00:15.788 --> 05:00:15.798 align:start position:0%
experiment um on the polio
 
05:00:18.510 --> 05:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine so something momentous happened
 
05:00:20.548 --> 05:00:20.558 align:start position:0%
in the history of polio eradication in
 
05:00:21.830 --> 05:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
April of
 
05:00:26.350 --> 05:00:26.360 align:start position:0%
2016 over a period of two weeks 155
 
05:00:29.310 --> 05:00:29.320 align:start position:0%
countries and territories started to use
 
05:00:33.190 --> 05:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
a new version of Albert sabin's classic
 
05:00:36.390 --> 05:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
oral polio vaccine opv that no longer
 
05:00:38.470 --> 05:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
protected against one of the three types
 
05:00:41.670 --> 05:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
of the polio virus type 2 virus that had
 
05:00:44.270 --> 05:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
been eradicated by then and the only
 
05:00:47.110 --> 05:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
remaining type 2 polio cases were
 
05:00:48.830 --> 05:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
touched off by the live virus in the
 
05:00:50.990 --> 05:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine itself dropping the type two
 
05:00:52.948 --> 05:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
component from the vaccine would end
 
05:00:56.310 --> 05:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
those cases as well the thinking went
 
05:00:59.110 --> 05:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
but the switch as this Global move has
 
05:01:01.670 --> 05:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
become known became an unqualified
 
05:01:04.510 --> 05:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
failure according to the unusually blunt
 
05:01:06.390 --> 05:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
draft report commissioned by the global
 
05:01:10.310 --> 05:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
polio eradication initiative gpei
 
05:01:12.948 --> 05:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
that is now open for public comments
 
05:01:15.990 --> 05:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly vaccine derived polio type
 
05:01:18.548 --> 05:01:18.558 align:start position:0%
2 has continued to circulate after the
 
05:01:23.150 --> 05:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
switch paralyzing more than
 
05:01:23.160 --> 05:01:26.350 align:start position:0%
switch paralyzing more than
3,300

05:01:26.350 --> 05:01:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:31.070 --> 05:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:35.670 --> 05:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
me even after that they still say in
 
05:01:38.910 --> 05:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
this article this report is a real hard
 
05:01:41.708 --> 05:01:41.718 align:start position:0%
read says John I can't pronounce his
 
05:01:43.830 --> 05:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
last name for the fool director of the
 
05:01:46.830 --> 05:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
cdc's global immunization Division and a
 
05:01:48.990 --> 05:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
member of the strategy committee that
 
05:01:53.070 --> 05:01:53.080 align:start position:0%
governs gpei but he says I also think it
 
05:01:55.868 --> 05:01:55.878 align:start position:0%
will lead us to forging very effective
 
05:01:59.350 --> 05:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
paths to finish the job of
 
05:02:02.110 --> 05:02:02.120 align:start position:0%
eradication I don't need to read any
 
05:02:04.868 --> 05:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
other um Snippets from this other
 
05:02:08.310 --> 05:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
article but I think that that's just a
 
05:02:12.030 --> 05:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
wakeup call about how important it is to
 
05:02:16.190 --> 05:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
be very serious with vaccination
 
05:02:21.548 --> 05:02:21.558 align:start position:0%
efforts um it this putting this line in
 
05:02:24.350 --> 05:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop anything it removes things
 
05:02:26.868 --> 05:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
from a schedule because it doesn't
 
05:02:29.788 --> 05:02:29.798 align:start position:0%
prevent transmission everyone is still
 
05:02:33.110 --> 05:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
free to get as many vaccinations as they
 
05:02:36.470 --> 05:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
want for their families it's clear the
 
05:02:38.990 --> 05:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
reason why they're in there as a mandate
 
05:02:41.750 --> 05:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
is because it's it's supposed to stop
 
05:02:44.030 --> 05:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
transmission it does
 
05:02:46.750 --> 05:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
not I'll take any questions thank you
 
05:02:46.760 --> 05:02:48.708 align:start position:0%
not I'll take any questions thank you
any

05:02:48.708 --> 05:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:02:55.948 --> 05:02:55.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:58.510 --> 05:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak at Colleen
 
05:03:00.350 --> 05:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
Smith and Dr Benjamin Chan from the
 
05:03:26.868 --> 05:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:29.708 --> 05:03:29.718 align:start position:0%
testing all right uh good afternoon
 
05:03:31.590 --> 05:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
again uh Mr chair members of the
 
05:03:33.150 --> 05:03:33.160 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for this opportunity
 
05:03:35.430 --> 05:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
yet again to come and testify before you
 
05:03:38.750 --> 05:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 679 again for the record
 
05:03:40.310 --> 05:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
my name is Dr Benjamin Shan I'm the
 
05:03:41.708 --> 05:03:41.718 align:start position:0%
state epidemiologist at the New
 
05:03:42.990 --> 05:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Health and Human
 
05:03:45.590 --> 05:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
Services and I'm joined by Colleen Smith
 
05:03:48.110 --> 05:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
who's the bureau chief uh for the the
 
05:03:50.430 --> 05:03:50.440 align:start position:0%
Bureau of uh Infectious Disease Control
 
05:03:53.150 --> 05:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
in public health um before I jump into
 
05:03:56.670 --> 05:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
some of the details on this um testimony
 
05:03:59.750 --> 05:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
I know these uh these hearings can get a
 
05:04:01.150 --> 05:04:01.160 align:start position:0%
little bit technical especially when
 
05:04:03.430 --> 05:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about scientific studies
 
05:04:04.708 --> 05:04:04.718 align:start position:0%
and different types of scientific
 
05:04:06.430 --> 05:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
studies so I I want to bring us back to
 
05:04:08.868 --> 05:04:08.878 align:start position:0%
the fact that uh the department only
 
05:04:11.510 --> 05:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
requires a subset of all recommended
 
05:04:13.830 --> 05:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines 10 uh vaccines to protect
 
05:04:15.990 --> 05:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
against 10 different diseases uh for
 
05:04:18.590 --> 05:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
entering into school and child care um
 
05:04:20.510 --> 05:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
and these are vaccines that are highly
 
05:04:23.788 --> 05:04:23.798 align:start position:0%
effective at preventing disease uh and
 
05:04:26.708 --> 05:04:26.718 align:start position:0%
hence keep kids and schools and child
 
05:04:28.868 --> 05:04:28.878 align:start position:0%
care agencies and communities safe and
 
05:04:31.070 --> 05:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
that there are uh medical and religious
 
05:04:33.750 --> 05:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
exemptions available for um for people
 
05:04:37.310 --> 05:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
to uh balance the requirements with uh
 
05:04:39.670 --> 05:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
medical need and religious right and Rel
 
05:04:42.670 --> 05:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
ious Freedom um I I do want to however
 
05:04:45.310 --> 05:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
uh be clear I think that the department
 
05:04:48.708 --> 05:04:48.718 align:start position:0%
uh opposes House Bill 679 um for a
 
05:04:50.190 --> 05:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
number of reasons the first is that the
 
05:04:52.310 --> 05:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
wording on the bill is
 
05:04:54.548 --> 05:04:54.558 align:start position:0%
unclear um depending on how the
 
05:04:57.708 --> 05:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
legislation is interpreted uh if adopted
 
05:05:00.670 --> 05:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill 679 could prevent requiring
 
05:05:02.788 --> 05:05:02.798 align:start position:0%
many important childhood immunizations
 
05:05:05.430 --> 05:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
again based on the intent um I want to
 
05:05:07.030 --> 05:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
highlight again that the primary purpose
 
05:05:08.868 --> 05:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
of any vaccine is to prevent sickness
 
05:05:10.270 --> 05:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
and disease
 
05:05:11.948 --> 05:05:11.958 align:start position:0%
uh especially more severe illness that
 
05:05:13.868 --> 05:05:13.878 align:start position:0%
can be life-threatening or
 
05:05:17.030 --> 05:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
incapacitating um and all vaccines that
 
05:05:19.150 --> 05:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
are currently required for entry into
 
05:05:21.708 --> 05:05:21.718 align:start position:0%
school or Child Care do prevent illness
 
05:05:25.030 --> 05:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
and do prevent the spread of disease but
 
05:05:26.948 --> 05:05:26.958 align:start position:0%
vaccines are not 100% effective at
 
05:05:30.390 --> 05:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
stopping transmission of pathogens um
 
05:05:32.708 --> 05:05:32.718 align:start position:0%
and even vaccines that are effective at
 
05:05:35.510 --> 05:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
preventing some transmission many if not
 
05:05:38.310 --> 05:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
most are not going to be 100% um
 
05:05:40.548 --> 05:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
effective at preventing the spread or
 
05:05:42.948 --> 05:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
the transmission of the actual pathogen
 
05:05:44.470 --> 05:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
that causes
 
05:05:46.910 --> 05:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
disease so it's unclear whether House
 
05:05:49.070 --> 05:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 679 intends to limit vaccine
 
05:05:50.750 --> 05:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
requirements to only those vaccines that
 
05:05:51.948 --> 05:05:51.958 align:start position:0%
have been shown to be effective at
 
05:05:54.030 --> 05:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
preventing the spread of disease which
 
05:05:56.910 --> 05:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
is all vaccines or vaccines that have
 
05:05:58.548 --> 05:05:58.558 align:start position:0%
explicitly been studied and shown to be
 
05:06:00.230 --> 05:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
effective at preventing the spread of
 
05:06:03.708 --> 05:06:03.718 align:start position:0%
infectious pathogens um if the intent is
 
05:06:06.230 --> 05:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
to have proven efficacy at preventing
 
05:06:09.230 --> 05:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
spread of the pathogens themselves uh
 
05:06:10.948 --> 05:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
then again the department may not be
 
05:06:14.310 --> 05:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
able to require um any vaccine because
 
05:06:17.470 --> 05:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
no vaccine is 100% effective so some
 
05:06:19.470 --> 05:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
examples and the other important point I
 
05:06:22.750 --> 05:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
want to note is that clinical trials um
 
05:06:24.390 --> 05:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
the clinical trials that are used to
 
05:06:28.390 --> 05:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
study vaccines um usually don't look at
 
05:06:30.628 --> 05:06:30.638 align:start position:0%
uh transmission of infectious pathogens
 
05:06:32.070 --> 05:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
as the clinical endpoint that they're
 
05:06:34.150 --> 05:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
studying right they look at prevention
 
05:06:37.830 --> 05:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
of disease um and so the absence of a
 
05:06:40.708 --> 05:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
clinical trial
 
05:06:42.788 --> 05:06:42.798 align:start position:0%
uh showing prevention of transmission
 
05:06:44.470 --> 05:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that vaccines aren't
 
05:06:46.150 --> 05:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
effective at doing that this is one of
 
05:06:47.948 --> 05:06:47.958 align:start position:0%
those gray areas where there may not be
 
05:06:49.590 --> 05:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
data because that's not how the clinical
 
05:06:52.190 --> 05:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
trials are designed uh so some examples
 
05:06:54.470 --> 05:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
I think you heard in prior testimony uh
 
05:06:57.150 --> 05:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
concern that uh hemophilus influenza
 
05:07:01.070 --> 05:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
type B or Hib and deia vaccines are not
 
05:07:03.390 --> 05:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
effective at preventing transmission I I
 
05:07:05.230 --> 05:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
would counter that these are diseases we
 
05:07:07.708 --> 05:07:07.718 align:start position:0%
don't see anymore in clinical medicine I
 
05:07:09.510 --> 05:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
can't remember the last time we had a
 
05:07:11.390 --> 05:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
report and these are reportable diseases
 
05:07:13.830 --> 05:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
to Public Health I can't remember a time
 
05:07:17.190 --> 05:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
when we had a a case of Hib infection or
 
05:07:19.628 --> 05:07:19.638 align:start position:0%
deia infection in New Hampshire because
 
05:07:21.868 --> 05:07:21.878 align:start position:0%
the vaccines are pre are effective at
 
05:07:24.510 --> 05:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
preventing disease and even when you
 
05:07:26.310 --> 05:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
might pick these up on routine throat
 
05:07:28.030 --> 05:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
cultures for example they're they're
 
05:07:29.628 --> 05:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
just not found anymore these pathogens
 
05:07:31.628 --> 05:07:31.638 align:start position:0%
are not routinely out there and
 
05:07:33.750 --> 05:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
circulating but if vaccination rates
 
05:07:35.868 --> 05:07:35.878 align:start position:0%
fall low enough as we've seen with other
 
05:07:38.390 --> 05:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
diseases they could make a comeback um
 
05:07:39.670 --> 05:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
you've heard mention of the Polar
 
05:07:42.868 --> 05:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
vaccine the polio vaccine is uh more
 
05:07:45.750 --> 05:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
than 99% effective after three doses at
 
05:07:49.430 --> 05:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
preventing paralytic polio but the the
 
05:07:51.670 --> 05:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh sponsor is correct that the
 
05:07:54.270 --> 05:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
inactivated polio vaccine the vaccine
 
05:07:56.510 --> 05:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
the shot does not necessarily produce
 
05:07:58.390 --> 05:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
the gut immunity or the intestinal
 
05:08:00.590 --> 05:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
immunity that would prevent the the
 
05:08:02.708 --> 05:08:02.718 align:start position:0%
virus from passing through a person's
 
05:08:05.030 --> 05:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
feces to somebody else if they were
 
05:08:07.430 --> 05:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
exposed but again we have seen
 
05:08:09.548 --> 05:08:09.558 align:start position:0%
remarkable strides globally in
 
05:08:11.990 --> 05:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
eradicating polio there's only one other
 
05:08:13.510 --> 05:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
disease out there that has been
 
05:08:17.150 --> 05:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
eradicated small poox uh and yet we have
 
05:08:21.110 --> 05:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
a uh vaccines plural and a global
 
05:08:24.230 --> 05:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
strategy by which we can achieve Global
 
05:08:26.830 --> 05:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
eradication of a disease and in
 
05:08:28.670 --> 05:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
potentially in the future not require
 
05:08:30.750 --> 05:08:30.760 align:start position:0%
the vaccine anymore but that work is
 
05:08:33.270 --> 05:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
still ongoing uh you also heard mention
 
05:08:36.430 --> 05:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
of uh pertusus it's true that pertusus
 
05:08:38.070 --> 05:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh is not the most effective vaccine
 
05:08:40.548 --> 05:08:40.558 align:start position:0%
that we have but it is 80 85% effective
 
05:08:44.910 --> 05:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
at preventing uh severe illness um and
 
05:08:46.788 --> 05:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
that could cause you know weeks or
 
05:08:49.670 --> 05:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
months or potentially longer term uh
 
05:08:52.350 --> 05:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
symptoms and complications of disease um
 
05:08:53.948 --> 05:08:53.958 align:start position:0%
so again I think it comes back to the
 
05:08:57.150 --> 05:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
fact that um you know clinical trials
 
05:08:59.990 --> 05:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
are not usually designed to study uh
 
05:09:03.110 --> 05:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
prevention of spread of a pathogen they
 
05:09:05.628 --> 05:09:05.638 align:start position:0%
are used to study prevention of disease
 
05:09:07.830 --> 05:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
and all of the required vaccines that we
 
05:09:12.350 --> 05:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
have uh listed um do that um so the
 
05:09:14.750 --> 05:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
bottom line is I guess again uh vaccines
 
05:09:16.830 --> 05:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
prevent disease prevent the spread of
 
05:09:19.670 --> 05:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
disease prevent severe disease keep
 
05:09:21.868 --> 05:09:21.878 align:start position:0%
children and staff healthy and in school
 
05:09:23.868 --> 05:09:23.878 align:start position:0%
and in child care and it protects the
 
05:09:25.470 --> 05:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
individual but also the people around
 
05:09:28.150 --> 05:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
them um with that let me stop and happy
 
05:09:29.830 --> 05:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
to uh we're happy to take questions
 
05:09:32.430 --> 05:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
thank you two seconds had two seconds
 
05:09:35.470 --> 05:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
left perfect timing representative
 
05:09:37.830 --> 05:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
Drew so I asked this question before but
 
05:09:41.390 --> 05:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask you if if vaccines were
 
05:09:43.788 --> 05:09:43.798 align:start position:0%
recommended by the state and not
 
05:09:45.628 --> 05:09:45.638 align:start position:0%
mandated by the state would that change
 
05:09:50.110 --> 05:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:53.390 --> 05:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
way um maybe I'll start and I'll see if
 
05:09:54.910 --> 05:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
uh Colleen Colleen wants to chime in
 
05:09:57.670 --> 05:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
here as well uh will that change our job
 
05:09:59.670 --> 05:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
in any way you know I think the answer
 
05:10:02.430 --> 05:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
is yes and it's not about changing my
 
05:10:04.030 --> 05:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
job I think it's about you know
 
05:10:06.070 --> 05:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
protecting the the health and the
 
05:10:08.110 --> 05:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
well-being of schools and children and
 
05:10:10.430 --> 05:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
communities and uh you know we've
 
05:10:12.910 --> 05:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
already seen that as uh requirements are
 
05:10:15.868 --> 05:10:15.878 align:start position:0%
relaxed over time that exemption rates
 
05:10:18.070 --> 05:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
have increased and certainly if if this
 
05:10:20.390 --> 05:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
bill or the prior Bill are enacted it
 
05:10:25.270 --> 05:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
would um likely do away with many if not
 
05:10:28.590 --> 05:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
most vaccine requirements which would
 
05:10:31.628 --> 05:10:31.638 align:start position:0%
further uh decrease vaccination rates
 
05:10:33.750 --> 05:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
leading to increased diseases new
 
05:10:35.510 --> 05:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
introductions of disease new outbreaks
 
05:10:38.750 --> 05:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
of disease um all of which are um
 
05:10:41.628 --> 05:10:41.638 align:start position:0%
investig by public health um you know
 
05:10:43.350 --> 05:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
there have been estimates that you know
 
05:10:45.868 --> 05:10:45.878 align:start position:0%
a single measles Outbreak on average
 
05:10:48.310 --> 05:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
costs $30,000 the the one back in I
 
05:10:50.510 --> 05:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
think 2018 2019 in New York City cost
 
05:10:52.190 --> 05:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
them over a million dollars to respond
 
05:10:54.788 --> 05:10:54.798 align:start position:0%
to so you know there is both a health
 
05:10:57.670 --> 05:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
aspect as well as a time and cost aspect
 
05:11:00.868 --> 05:11:00.878 align:start position:0%
to responding to infectious diseases I
 
05:11:03.070 --> 05:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if you want to
 
05:11:05.750 --> 05:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
add anyone else representative delus
 
05:11:08.470 --> 05:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
then representative Kastle thank you Mr
 
05:11:10.030 --> 05:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
chairman than thank you for taking my
 
05:11:12.548 --> 05:11:12.558 align:start position:0%
question so do you do you know how many
 
05:11:15.548 --> 05:11:15.558 align:start position:0%
parents or Guardians refuse the vaccines
 
05:11:17.470 --> 05:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
the mandated
 
05:11:21.190 --> 05:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
vaccines you want to so we we do not
 
05:11:23.230 --> 05:11:23.240 align:start position:0%
collect that information as far as how
 
05:11:26.910 --> 05:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
many have opted out of vaccines we we do
 
05:11:29.590 --> 05:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
we we do have information as far as
 
05:11:31.350 --> 05:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
those that have claimed medical or
 
05:11:33.470 --> 05:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions for school entry
 
05:11:36.350 --> 05:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
but we don't have uh specific data on
 
05:11:38.628 --> 05:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
opt out and we also have those that are
 
05:11:40.110 --> 05:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
have the percent percent of those that
 
05:11:42.628 --> 05:11:42.638 align:start position:0%
are up to date on their
 
05:11:42.638 --> 05:11:44.708 align:start position:0%
are up to date on their
vaccines

05:11:44.708 --> 05:11:44.718 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
05:11:46.628 --> 05:11:46.638 align:start position:0%
followup I guess this could be a
 
05:11:49.310 --> 05:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up so do parents or Guardians are
 
05:11:51.788 --> 05:11:51.798 align:start position:0%
you aware of any parents or Guardians
 
05:11:55.350 --> 05:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
who request additional vaccines on top
 
05:11:58.548 --> 05:11:58.558 align:start position:0%
of the required
 
05:12:00.628 --> 05:12:00.638 align:start position:0%
vaccines uh so so I guess two two
 
05:12:02.070 --> 05:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
comments to that one is that we don't
 
05:12:04.270 --> 05:12:04.280 align:start position:0%
get patient specific information at the
 
05:12:06.590 --> 05:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
health department about who declines and
 
05:12:08.190 --> 05:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
who wants vaccines that's probably a
 
05:12:11.628 --> 05:12:11.638 align:start position:0%
better question for um uh a primary care
 
05:12:13.948 --> 05:12:13.958 align:start position:0%
provider but I I will say that you know
 
05:12:17.030 --> 05:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
the the list of uh required vaccines
 
05:12:19.628 --> 05:12:19.638 align:start position:0%
protect against 10 different diseases
 
05:12:22.270 --> 05:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
not all you know not all recommended
 
05:12:25.628 --> 05:12:25.638 align:start position:0%
vaccines are on that list um you know
 
05:12:28.590 --> 05:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
it's maybe about 50 to 60% of the all
 
05:12:30.750 --> 05:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
recommended vaccines are on that list
 
05:12:35.350 --> 05:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
it's a rough estimate um and so I I
 
05:12:37.510 --> 05:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
think there are people out there that
 
05:12:39.350 --> 05:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
get all the recommended vaccines not the
 
05:12:41.110 --> 05:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
ones on the required list but I we don't
 
05:12:42.750 --> 05:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
have those
 
05:12:45.708 --> 05:12:45.718 align:start position:0%
numbers representative kleang thank you
 
05:12:48.470 --> 05:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so reading through the the
 
05:12:50.230 --> 05:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
outline part that you said in the bill
 
05:12:52.868 --> 05:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
to prevent transmission uh of any
 
05:12:54.750 --> 05:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
disease so the question I have I'm
 
05:12:56.708 --> 05:12:56.718 align:start position:0%
seeing this sheet here with a bunch of
 
05:12:57.948 --> 05:12:57.958 align:start position:0%
bunch of these different things that
 
05:13:00.230 --> 05:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
that are given for immunizations now the
 
05:13:01.990 --> 05:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
question I have specifically to that is
 
05:13:03.788 --> 05:13:03.798 align:start position:0%
any of these immunizations on this have
 
05:13:06.910 --> 05:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
a potential to spread the pro or
 
05:13:09.430 --> 05:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
transmit the disease the same way yeah
 
05:13:10.350 --> 05:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
uh thanks for that question
 
05:13:12.190 --> 05:13:12.200 align:start position:0%
representative I I don't have that sheet
 
05:13:13.708 --> 05:13:13.718 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm not sure what exactly you
 
05:13:15.070 --> 05:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
were looking
 
05:13:18.548 --> 05:13:18.558 align:start position:0%
at I'll I'll respond to the perhaps the
 
05:13:21.070 --> 05:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
the prior um the
 
05:13:25.390 --> 05:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
prior testimony about pusis po people
 
05:13:27.190 --> 05:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
getting vaccinated with pus potentially
 
05:13:30.270 --> 05:13:30.280 align:start position:0%
serving as a reservoir um you know as I
 
05:13:32.270 --> 05:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned that's that's uh I I don't I
 
05:13:34.030 --> 05:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
don't know that data I'm not sure I
 
05:13:35.350 --> 05:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
haven't I'm not familiar with the
 
05:13:36.788 --> 05:13:36.798 align:start position:0%
article that the person was was
 
05:13:39.350 --> 05:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
referring to um you know I will say that
 
05:13:41.948 --> 05:13:41.958 align:start position:0%
anytime you have a lower efficacy
 
05:13:43.948 --> 05:13:43.958 align:start position:0%
vaccine and again that the pertusus of
 
05:13:45.708 --> 05:13:45.718 align:start position:0%
all the ones that are on the required
 
05:13:47.590 --> 05:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
list pertusus you know most of the
 
05:13:48.990 --> 05:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines on the required list are like
 
05:13:51.750 --> 05:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
95 plus perc effective at preventing
 
05:13:53.470 --> 05:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
disease when you have a vaccine that's
 
05:13:56.470 --> 05:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
that effective which is most of them um
 
05:13:58.150 --> 05:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
they're they're going to be pre
 
05:13:59.670 --> 05:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
effective at preventing not only the
 
05:14:01.910 --> 05:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
disease but likely transmission as well
 
05:14:03.470 --> 05:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
right I mean you see this with with
 
05:14:06.548 --> 05:14:06.558 align:start position:0%
measles um you you you see the the you
 
05:14:08.110 --> 05:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
know this is why we can eradicate
 
05:14:10.590 --> 05:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
certain diseases pressus um may be
 
05:14:12.750 --> 05:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
slightly different in that the efficacy
 
05:14:14.628 --> 05:14:14.638 align:start position:0%
is focused more around preventing severe
 
05:14:17.670 --> 05:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
disease 80 to 85% effective so it's
 
05:14:19.470 --> 05:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
certainly possible that uh somebody
 
05:14:22.548 --> 05:14:22.558 align:start position:0%
could have a more mild illness um be in
 
05:14:24.510 --> 05:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
a a school setting and then spread it to
 
05:14:25.948 --> 05:14:25.958 align:start position:0%
other people but in terms of how
 
05:14:28.670 --> 05:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
commonly that happens we we don't have
 
05:14:30.708 --> 05:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
we we don't have data on it and you know
 
05:14:33.350 --> 05:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
whether vaccination leads to increased
 
05:14:36.110 --> 05:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
spread again I I don't I don't know that
 
05:14:37.628 --> 05:14:37.638 align:start position:0%
there's good data around that or I don't
 
05:14:39.030 --> 05:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
know what the data was at the price
 
05:14:41.470 --> 05:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
prior person was referring to follow
 
05:14:43.350 --> 05:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I guess how would you
 
05:14:44.548 --> 05:14:44.558 align:start position:0%
collect the data because it doesn't
 
05:14:45.948 --> 05:14:45.958 align:start position:0%
sound like you have the information to
 
05:14:48.030 --> 05:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
answer that effectively so how would you
 
05:14:48.040 --> 05:14:49.270 align:start position:0%
answer that effectively so how would you
obtain

05:14:49.270 --> 05:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
obtain
 
05:14:52.190 --> 05:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
that uh that that's a good that's a good
 
05:14:52.200 --> 05:14:53.990 align:start position:0%
that uh that that's a good that's a good
question

05:14:53.990 --> 05:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:14:58.750 --> 05:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
um there would have to be uh trying to
 
05:15:00.990 --> 05:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
think about you know what kind of study
 
05:15:03.830 --> 05:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
would be you know what kind of study
 
05:15:06.190 --> 05:15:06.200 align:start position:0%
would would be required of that um you
 
05:15:08.070 --> 05:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
know we we investigate every person
 
05:15:10.430 --> 05:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with tus so that we can
 
05:15:13.190 --> 05:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
identify people that may be exposed uh
 
05:15:15.788 --> 05:15:15.798 align:start position:0%
to get them um appropriate an for
 
05:15:17.830 --> 05:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
example antibiotic profilaxis to prevent
 
05:15:20.270 --> 05:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
coming down with infection um so you
 
05:15:22.788 --> 05:15:22.798 align:start position:0%
know we have data in terms of uh how how
 
05:15:26.750 --> 05:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
often pressus is diagnosed but that's um
 
05:15:28.910 --> 05:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
probably a subset of all the people with
 
05:15:30.750 --> 05:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
pressus out there so there would have to
 
05:15:33.990 --> 05:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
be you know large screening trials that
 
05:15:37.110 --> 05:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
are conducted um in you know certain
 
05:15:39.190 --> 05:15:39.200 align:start position:0%
populations I I don't I don't know that
 
05:15:41.948 --> 05:15:41.958 align:start position:0%
those Studies have been have been
 
05:15:45.390 --> 05:15:45.400 align:start position:0%
done one final one yeah just to clarify
 
05:15:47.150 --> 05:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
so you said that that you guys do get
 
05:15:49.750 --> 05:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
the information for prasa specifically
 
05:15:51.350 --> 05:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
or you said you have for for
 
05:15:53.750 --> 05:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
investigation thank you is that data is
 
05:15:56.310 --> 05:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
that data somewhere uh it's it's all
 
05:15:59.030 --> 05:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's all online on our our website uh we
 
05:16:02.110 --> 05:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
list a uh publish a monthly reportable
 
05:16:07.590 --> 05:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
disease list um where uh we we put the
 
05:16:09.190 --> 05:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
numbers of people with different
 
05:16:11.830 --> 05:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
diseases that are reported to us again
 
05:16:13.310 --> 05:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
that's those are just the people that
 
05:16:15.670 --> 05:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
are tested and diagnosed and then
 
05:16:18.150 --> 05:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
reported to us um pressus is one of
 
05:16:20.150 --> 05:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
those areas where you know symptoms at
 
05:16:21.830 --> 05:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
least in the early stages can M can
 
05:16:24.270 --> 05:16:24.280 align:start position:0%
mimic other types of infections and so
 
05:16:26.470 --> 05:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
testing may not be done people whether
 
05:16:28.110 --> 05:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
they're vaccinated or not could be out
 
05:16:30.150 --> 05:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
there you know spreading the disease and
 
05:16:33.390 --> 05:16:33.400 align:start position:0%
if we get alerted to that we do our
 
05:16:35.350 --> 05:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
investigation representative McGrath did
 
05:16:39.030 --> 05:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:40.590 --> 05:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:16:42.030 --> 05:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
05:16:45.430 --> 05:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
question can you tell us what
 
05:16:48.910 --> 05:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
the current definition of what a vaccine
 
05:16:52.030 --> 05:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
is my understanding is that the
 
05:16:54.910 --> 05:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
definition was changed
 
05:16:57.310 --> 05:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
recently and do you know what the change
 
05:17:01.070 --> 05:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
was and why that happened you remember U
 
05:17:03.948 --> 05:17:03.958 align:start position:0%
this is I assume somewhere in RSA 141c
 
05:17:08.430 --> 05:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
yes it so so the the uh the definition
 
05:17:11.948 --> 05:17:11.958 align:start position:0%
was Chang CH by Senate Bill 559 last
 
05:17:15.510 --> 05:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
session so that it was to include the R
 
05:17:18.030 --> 05:17:18.040 align:start position:0%
so that the RSV vaccine would be
 
05:17:21.670 --> 05:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
included uh in the the vaccine for the
 
05:17:24.390 --> 05:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
universal vaccine purchasing program so
 
05:17:27.070 --> 05:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
it was worded to and I we can pull up
 
05:17:29.310 --> 05:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
the exact wording but so that a monocon
 
05:17:31.310 --> 05:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
antibody was included in the definition
 
05:17:31.320 --> 05:17:32.750 align:start position:0%
antibody was included in the definition
of

05:17:32.750 --> 05:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:17:36.310 --> 05:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine or immunization I should
 
05:17:39.788 --> 05:17:39.798 align:start position:0%
say okay any any other
 
05:17:43.150 --> 05:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
questions saying none thank you thank
 
05:17:49.948 --> 05:17:49.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:52.750 --> 05:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
much also signed up to speak is Victoria
 
05:17:54.510 --> 05:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
Shaheen from New Hampshire families for
 
05:17:54.520 --> 05:18:12.670 align:start position:0%
Shaheen from New Hampshire families for
vaccines

05:18:12.670 --> 05:18:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:15.590 --> 05:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
micone there you go thank you uh I'd
 
05:18:17.190 --> 05:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
like to voice my strong opposition to
 
05:18:20.270 --> 05:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 679 which places a brand new
 
05:18:22.788 --> 05:18:22.798 align:start position:0%
requirement that a vaccine must be shown
 
05:18:24.750 --> 05:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
quote in clinical trials to prevent
 
05:18:27.150 --> 05:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
transmission of any disease um as
 
05:18:28.590 --> 05:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
pointed out this is not how clinical
 
05:18:31.708 --> 05:18:31.718 align:start position:0%
trials are conducted um I think the bill
 
05:18:33.190 --> 05:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
also neglects to consider some of the
 
05:18:35.548 --> 05:18:35.558 align:start position:0%
fundamental principles of virology and
 
05:18:37.990 --> 05:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
infectious disease transmission uh
 
05:18:39.708 --> 05:18:39.718 align:start position:0%
vaccines are designed to keep people
 
05:18:42.350 --> 05:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
from being hospitalized and uh from
 
05:18:45.350 --> 05:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
dying uh they are tested for safety and
 
05:18:47.110 --> 05:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
efficacy very rigorously in clinical
 
05:18:50.070 --> 05:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
trials um AKA how good they are at
 
05:18:52.190 --> 05:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
keeping people out of the hospitals and
 
05:18:53.230 --> 05:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
05:18:56.548 --> 05:18:56.558 align:start position:0%
morgs um it is not possible uh to my
 
05:18:58.948 --> 05:18:58.958 align:start position:0%
knowledge to incorporate um transmission
 
05:19:01.910 --> 05:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
blocking properties as a clinical end
 
05:19:04.510 --> 05:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
point in a trial um I think that would
 
05:19:06.628 --> 05:19:06.638 align:start position:0%
need to be demonstrated before we could
 
05:19:09.190 --> 05:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
actually legislate that um so it seems
 
05:19:10.230 --> 05:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
like the bill is trying to make a
 
05:19:11.628 --> 05:19:11.638 align:start position:0%
requirement out of something that isn't
 
05:19:13.310 --> 05:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
done or cannot be done in the first
 
05:19:14.948 --> 05:19:14.958 align:start position:0%
place in order to create an impossible
 
05:19:17.510 --> 05:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
standard that no vaccine could ever meet
 
05:19:21.708 --> 05:19:21.718 align:start position:0%
uh again aimed at limiting access um so
 
05:19:23.548 --> 05:19:23.558 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned vaccines are tested for
 
05:19:25.708 --> 05:19:25.718 align:start position:0%
safety and efficacy however transmission
 
05:19:29.070 --> 05:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
Dynamics are indeed studied during the
 
05:19:31.350 --> 05:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
open label period and any postmarket
 
05:19:33.868 --> 05:19:33.878 align:start position:0%
surveillance we collect epidemiological
 
05:19:36.628 --> 05:19:36.638 align:start position:0%
data um
 
05:19:39.270 --> 05:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
we we it has been demonstrated that
 
05:19:41.830 --> 05:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
vaccination can reduce uh viral load
 
05:19:44.030 --> 05:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
that an infected person is carrying um
 
05:19:47.510 --> 05:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
so uh one thing about viral replication
 
05:19:49.510 --> 05:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
is that it is the only predictable thing
 
05:19:51.990 --> 05:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
about it is that it's very chaotic and
 
05:19:54.110 --> 05:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
the virus's goal is to reach host cells
 
05:19:55.948 --> 05:19:55.958 align:start position:0%
in an unvaccinated individual there are
 
05:19:58.110 --> 05:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
billions and billions more copies of
 
05:20:01.390 --> 05:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
viruses being made and being expelled
 
05:20:03.350 --> 05:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
typically into the air uh for other
 
05:20:05.868 --> 05:20:05.878 align:start position:0%
people to catch so A reduced viral load
 
05:20:08.750 --> 05:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
does indeed reduce transmission um
 
05:20:10.830 --> 05:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines lessen the severity of symptoms
 
05:20:12.708 --> 05:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
so you may not be you know explosively
 
05:20:14.230 --> 05:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
coughing or sneezing all over the person
 
05:20:15.868 --> 05:20:15.878 align:start position:0%
next to you if you're vaccinated you're
 
05:20:17.190 --> 05:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
going to be shedding less virus you're
 
05:20:18.708 --> 05:20:18.718 align:start position:0%
going to be less contagious that is a
 
05:20:21.270 --> 05:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
lowering of transmission uh also
 
05:20:23.230 --> 05:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
duration of disease generally uh
 
05:20:25.510 --> 05:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines limit the severity of disease
 
05:20:28.110 --> 05:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
so you're contagious for a shorter
 
05:20:30.708 --> 05:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
period of time again if you've taken
 
05:20:32.868 --> 05:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
statistics uh it's a numbers game you're
 
05:20:34.270 --> 05:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
reducing transmission Again by
 
05:20:36.670 --> 05:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
shortening the length of uh acute
 
05:20:39.430 --> 05:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
symptoms um and finally more rapid
 
05:20:42.430 --> 05:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
clearance of infection uh altogether so
 
05:20:45.110 --> 05:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh that is what vaccines are designed to
 
05:20:49.830 --> 05:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
do and that is what they do um so again
 
05:20:53.030 --> 05:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
I think to set vaccines up for failure
 
05:20:54.350 --> 05:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
in a clinical trial by setting an
 
05:20:57.270 --> 05:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
impossible standard will limit access
 
05:21:02.270 --> 05:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
will decrease uptake and will will uh
 
05:21:04.350 --> 05:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
demonstrate the reemergence of a number
 
05:21:06.590 --> 05:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
of uh diseases we have not seen in a
 
05:21:09.190 --> 05:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
long time nor should we and I will close
 
05:21:11.110 --> 05:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh by mentioning I think this bill also
 
05:21:13.628 --> 05:21:13.638 align:start position:0%
fails to consider diseases that are not
 
05:21:15.310 --> 05:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
uh transmitted personto person like
 
05:21:16.990 --> 05:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
tetanus um which is something I would
 
05:21:19.750 --> 05:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
never uh wish on anyone especially a
 
05:21:24.150 --> 05:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
child so um how would you prove that the
 
05:21:25.750 --> 05:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
tetus vaccine prevents transmission
 
05:21:27.270 --> 05:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
which doesn't occur in the first place
 
05:21:30.708 --> 05:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
um or also uh the rabies vaccine so and
 
05:21:32.590 --> 05:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
from my understanding there is a bill
 
05:21:34.390 --> 05:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
floating around here somewhere that uh
 
05:21:37.150 --> 05:21:37.160 align:start position:0%
legalizes proposes to legalize keeping
 
05:21:39.470 --> 05:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
wild squirrels and raccoons as pets so I
 
05:21:41.510 --> 05:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
would hate to see us lose a rabies
 
05:21:43.230 --> 05:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine based on this recommendation so
 
05:21:44.750 --> 05:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
again I oppose this Bill thank you very
 
05:21:47.910 --> 05:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
much oh any questions representative
 
05:21:50.230 --> 05:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
R you've stated a couple of times that
 
05:21:52.788 --> 05:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
it would limit access by removing these
 
05:21:55.190 --> 05:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
vaccines from the Mandate how would it
 
05:21:55.200 --> 05:21:56.350 align:start position:0%
vaccines from the Mandate how would it
limit

05:21:56.350 --> 05:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
limit
 
05:22:01.270 --> 05:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
access um so well I
 
05:22:05.270 --> 05:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
think first of all if if uh vaccines
 
05:22:07.670 --> 05:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
aren't required we know um that their
 
05:22:09.788 --> 05:22:09.798 align:start position:0%
uptake will go down so that I think
 
05:22:12.750 --> 05:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
creates a lower demand um for these
 
05:22:15.910 --> 05:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
vaccines a lower demand creates a less
 
05:22:18.030 --> 05:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
of an incentive for manufacturers to
 
05:22:20.830 --> 05:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
actually make these vaccines uh so I
 
05:22:24.590 --> 05:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
could see um you know Supply going down
 
05:22:26.510 --> 05:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
and when there's limited Supply Access
 
05:22:30.310 --> 05:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
is limited um so that that would be my
 
05:22:30.320 --> 05:22:31.510 align:start position:0%
is limited um so that that would be my
my

05:22:31.510 --> 05:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:22:34.110 --> 05:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
answer any other
 
05:22:40.628 --> 05:22:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:42.548 --> 05:22:42.558 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Julie Kim
 
05:22:45.350 --> 05:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
from The New Hampshire American Academy
 
05:22:49.628 --> 05:22:49.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:51.708 --> 05:22:51.718 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics hello again everyone thank
 
05:22:54.470 --> 05:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
you for having me today um again I'm
 
05:22:56.510 --> 05:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
speaking for on behalf of the
 
05:22:58.590 --> 05:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
pediatricians in New Hampshire over 200
 
05:23:02.310 --> 05:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
of us to urge you to oppose House Bill
 
05:23:05.350 --> 05:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
679 approved childhood vaccines help to
 
05:23:07.270 --> 05:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
protect kids in a number of ways not
 
05:23:08.830 --> 05:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
just by preventing illness but it could
 
05:23:10.628 --> 05:23:10.638 align:start position:0%
also reduce the severity of symptoms
 
05:23:12.350 --> 05:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
you've heard all this before and it can
 
05:23:13.750 --> 05:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
reduce the risk of transmission to
 
05:23:15.830 --> 05:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
others by either reducing the duration
 
05:23:17.868 --> 05:23:17.878 align:start position:0%
of disease so hence reducing the risk of
 
05:23:20.390 --> 05:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
transmission or and also reducing load
 
05:23:23.270 --> 05:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
of um disease burden so there are other
 
05:23:25.230 --> 05:23:25.240 align:start position:0%
benefits besides just preventing the
 
05:23:27.230 --> 05:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
disease depending on the vaccine and the
 
05:23:29.510 --> 05:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine present pre preventable disease
 
05:23:31.990 --> 05:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
in question the benefits of vaccination
 
05:23:34.628 --> 05:23:34.638 align:start position:0%
differ what is consistent is that in all
 
05:23:37.070 --> 05:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
cases the FDA and other Global
 
05:23:39.510 --> 05:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
Regulators only approve vaccines for use
 
05:23:41.310 --> 05:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
if they determine that the data to use
 
05:23:43.628 --> 05:23:43.638 align:start position:0%
them has a favorable benefit and risk
 
05:23:45.548 --> 05:23:45.558 align:start position:0%
profile to the child who's going to
 
05:23:48.350 --> 05:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
receive the vaccine and then again after
 
05:23:50.548 --> 05:23:50.558 align:start position:0%
a vaccine is approved it is subject to
 
05:23:52.628 --> 05:23:52.638 align:start position:0%
ongoing real world monitoring to ensure
 
05:23:54.270 --> 05:23:54.280 align:start position:0%
that the benefits continue to outweigh
 
05:23:57.590 --> 05:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
the any potential risks as was just
 
05:23:59.788 --> 05:23:59.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned um this bill would prevent us
 
05:24:01.390 --> 05:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
from administering important disease
 
05:24:03.350 --> 05:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
like tetanus because that is not a a
 
05:24:04.910 --> 05:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
transmittable disease in the way from
 
05:24:07.110 --> 05:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
Human to human transmission but we know
 
05:24:08.830 --> 05:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
tetus is important for children and we
 
05:24:11.910 --> 05:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
have good and - tested interventions for
 
05:24:14.470 --> 05:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
this and then finally this bill is a
 
05:24:16.150 --> 05:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
reminder that there's some legislative
 
05:24:18.708 --> 05:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
intrusion into the practice of medicine
 
05:24:20.590 --> 05:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
and this has the potential for creating
 
05:24:22.868 --> 05:24:22.878 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences through changes
 
05:24:24.868 --> 05:24:24.878 align:start position:0%
in long-standing policies that are meant
 
05:24:26.948 --> 05:24:26.958 align:start position:0%
to protect the health and safy safety of
 
05:24:29.110 --> 05:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
our state citizens our young children
 
05:24:31.070 --> 05:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
and then the older people that they are
 
05:24:33.590 --> 05:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
in contact with so for this reason the
 
05:24:35.830 --> 05:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire AAP urges you to
 
05:24:39.190 --> 05:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
oppose House Bill 679 thanks
 
05:24:41.548 --> 05:24:41.558 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
05:24:45.510 --> 05:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:48.070 --> 05:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
05:24:50.070 --> 05:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
representative Janet Lucas on behalf of
 
05:25:17.150 --> 05:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:19.230 --> 05:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
05:25:22.030 --> 05:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
committee for your Indulgence today for
 
05:25:24.150 --> 05:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
the record I'm Janet Lucas I represent
 
05:25:26.868 --> 05:25:26.878 align:start position:0%
Grafton District Grafton County district
 
05:25:30.030 --> 05:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
7 which is Campton I am reading the
 
05:25:32.430 --> 05:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
testimony of a constituent so I will not
 
05:25:34.868 --> 05:25:34.878 align:start position:0%
be taking questions to the members of
 
05:25:38.310 --> 05:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is mag overb I
 
05:25:40.310 --> 05:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
reside in Campton I am a lifelong New
 
05:25:43.670 --> 05:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident and I am a pharmacist
 
05:25:46.310 --> 05:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
in a multihospital health system I am
 
05:25:48.470 --> 05:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
submitting this testimony in opposition
 
05:25:49.868 --> 05:25:49.878 align:start position:0%
to HB
 
05:25:52.868 --> 05:25:52.878 align:start position:0%
679 as a pharmacist I am concerned about
 
05:25:55.788 --> 05:25:55.798 align:start position:0%
the nature of this bill it seems
 
05:25:59.390 --> 05:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
relatively innocuous to a lay person it
 
05:26:02.670 --> 05:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
is just one sentence nothing in this
 
05:26:05.230 --> 05:26:05.240 align:start position:0%
section shall require a vaccine that has
 
05:26:08.670 --> 05:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
been shown in clinical trials to prevent
 
05:26:12.190 --> 05:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
transmission of any disease close quote
 
05:26:15.030 --> 05:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
in spite of this I believe that it is
 
05:26:17.150 --> 05:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
meant as an attack on our current
 
05:26:19.910 --> 05:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine laws vaccines are meant to
 
05:26:23.390 --> 05:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
prevent clinical and subclinical
 
05:26:26.750 --> 05:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
infections in vaccinated persons they
 
05:26:30.990 --> 05:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
are not intended to stop transmission of
 
05:26:34.948 --> 05:26:34.958 align:start position:0%
disease vaccines prevent infection not
 
05:26:37.430 --> 05:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
transmission an example of an agent
 
05:26:40.310 --> 05:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
intended to stop the transmission of a
 
05:26:43.628 --> 05:26:43.638 align:start position:0%
disease would be a mask which can
 
05:26:46.910 --> 05:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
prevent the transmission of respiratory
 
05:26:49.868 --> 05:26:49.878 align:start position:0%
diseases one could surmise then that the
 
05:26:52.110 --> 05:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is to effectively
 
05:26:55.510 --> 05:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
eliminate RSA 141c
 
05:26:58.750 --> 05:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
20-a I would venture a guess that the
 
05:27:01.670 --> 05:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
sponsoring legislators of this bill will
 
05:27:05.310 --> 05:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
not be proposing a mask mandate for all
 
05:27:07.390 --> 05:27:07.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents as an
 
05:27:10.430 --> 05:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
alternative to to the currently required
 
05:27:12.990 --> 05:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinations I truly do not understand
 
05:27:15.910 --> 05:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
the dogged anti-science dedication of
 
05:27:19.030 --> 05:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
this legislative session to cause harm
 
05:27:21.510 --> 05:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
and death to children in New Hampshire
 
05:27:23.868 --> 05:27:23.878 align:start position:0%
it is frankly appalling thank you for
 
05:27:27.070 --> 05:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
your consideration Meg overball doctor
 
05:27:28.948 --> 05:27:28.958 align:start position:0%
of Pharmacy
 
05:27:32.310 --> 05:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:35.350 --> 05:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Pam
 
05:27:37.430 --> 05:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
denapoli uh from the New Hampshire
 
05:27:45.948 --> 05:27:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:48.110 --> 05:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
Association uh thank you my name is Pam
 
05:27:51.070 --> 05:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
daple and um I submitt a written
 
05:27:52.948 --> 05:27:52.958 align:start position:0%
testimony for the New Hampshire school
 
05:27:56.830 --> 05:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
Nurses Association who opposes this bill
 
05:27:58.830 --> 05:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
um but what I'd like to do today is just
 
05:28:00.670 --> 05:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
to give you the realities of what it is
 
05:28:03.830 --> 05:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
to be a school nurse so we see probably
 
05:28:06.310 --> 05:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
40 to 60 students a day in most of the
 
05:28:08.948 --> 05:28:08.958 align:start position:0%
Manchester schools and every winter we
 
05:28:12.190 --> 05:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
do what we can to decrease the number of
 
05:28:14.868 --> 05:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases within our schools
 
05:28:17.430 --> 05:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
things like vomiting diarrhea cough and
 
05:28:19.590 --> 05:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
colds we send parents home a letter
 
05:28:21.310 --> 05:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
saying please keep your children home
 
05:28:24.070 --> 05:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
when they're sick this year at times
 
05:28:26.830 --> 05:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
we've had over half of the students in
 
05:28:28.948 --> 05:28:28.958 align:start position:0%
any one class absent with these
 
05:28:32.430 --> 05:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases so despite all of
 
05:28:34.590 --> 05:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
our efforts for infection control we
 
05:28:37.390 --> 05:28:37.400 align:start position:0%
can't control communicable diseases what
 
05:28:40.190 --> 05:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
we can control is vaccine preventable
 
05:28:43.030 --> 05:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
diseases so the more students that we
 
05:28:45.670 --> 05:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
can have vaccinated the greater chance
 
05:28:47.910 --> 05:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
that it's going to decrease transmission
 
05:28:50.548 --> 05:28:50.558 align:start position:0%
than it is to increase transmission what
 
05:28:53.270 --> 05:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
we've heard is that these uh vaccines
 
05:28:55.910 --> 05:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
are to prevent disease and severity of
 
05:28:58.350 --> 05:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
disease and not transmission but the
 
05:29:01.470 --> 05:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
more children that we can vaccinate the
 
05:29:03.310 --> 05:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
less chance that we are going to have
 
05:29:05.390 --> 05:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
the minimal chances of disease
 
05:29:07.470 --> 05:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
transmission we also know that there are
 
05:29:09.510 --> 05:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
certain children children who um have
 
05:29:12.310 --> 05:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
breakthrough diseases so despite being
 
05:29:15.788 --> 05:29:15.798 align:start position:0%
um vaccinated we see at times children
 
05:29:17.990 --> 05:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't build up sufficient immunity and
 
05:29:20.030 --> 05:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
may transmit the disease some
 
05:29:22.270 --> 05:29:22.280 align:start position:0%
individuals cannot develop immunity
 
05:29:24.990 --> 05:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
after vaccines and infants who are too
 
05:29:26.788 --> 05:29:26.798 align:start position:0%
young or may have not completed their
 
05:29:29.788 --> 05:29:29.798 align:start position:0%
vaccine series May transmit the disease
 
05:29:32.230 --> 05:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
and get the disease and have serious
 
05:29:35.990 --> 05:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
consequences so um in most counties it
 
05:29:37.548 --> 05:29:37.558 align:start position:0%
it's been asked today about whether or
 
05:29:40.990 --> 05:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
not most most parents refuse uh vaccines
 
05:29:43.548 --> 05:29:43.558 align:start position:0%
so in only one County in New Hampshire
 
05:29:45.708 --> 05:29:45.718 align:start position:0%
in Co county is
 
05:29:48.590 --> 05:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
95.7% uh transmission or uh vaccine
 
05:29:50.830 --> 05:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
coverage in all of our other counties we
 
05:29:53.350 --> 05:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
haven't reached the recommended 95%
 
05:29:57.310 --> 05:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
coverage for vaccines so if we uh make
 
05:30:00.310 --> 05:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh vaccines recommended versus mandated
 
05:30:04.310 --> 05:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
we risk falling way below 95% that we
 
05:30:07.470 --> 05:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
haven't even achieved yet so uh for the
 
05:30:09.548 --> 05:30:09.558 align:start position:0%
sake of the School nurses and all that
 
05:30:12.190 --> 05:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
we have to do in a day um we really
 
05:30:15.590 --> 05:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to be also excluding children
 
05:30:18.390 --> 05:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
who have vaccine preventable diseases
 
05:30:19.990 --> 05:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
05:30:22.310 --> 05:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
kessle wi thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:30:24.270 --> 05:30:24.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so does the
 
05:30:25.708 --> 05:30:25.718 align:start position:0%
school system I'm curious with the
 
05:30:27.830 --> 05:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
nurses do they have access to which
 
05:30:30.110 --> 05:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
children have taken the vaccine and who
 
05:30:32.548 --> 05:30:32.558 align:start position:0%
haven't we well if if you're in the
 
05:30:34.868 --> 05:30:34.878 align:start position:0%
school system you have to give us either
 
05:30:37.708 --> 05:30:37.718 align:start position:0%
um evidence that you had had vaccines or
 
05:30:39.670 --> 05:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
the religious exemption form that we
 
05:30:41.708 --> 05:30:41.718 align:start position:0%
talked about last
 
05:30:48.230 --> 05:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:51.030 --> 05:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Risa
 
05:30:56.190 --> 05:30:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:58.150 --> 05:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
defense uh you've asked for eight
 
05:30:59.788 --> 05:30:59.798 align:start position:0%
minutes I can't give you eight minutes
 
05:31:00.948 --> 05:31:00.958 align:start position:0%
three minutes pleas whatever you can
 
05:31:03.270 --> 05:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
give me I wasn't sure how it worked
 
05:31:05.750 --> 05:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you Mr chairman and
 
05:31:08.990 --> 05:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um so I think
 
05:31:10.910 --> 05:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
everybody here we all cherish our own
 
05:31:13.350 --> 05:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
bodily autonomy including the right to
 
05:31:15.708 --> 05:31:15.718 align:start position:0%
refuse unwanted medical interventions
 
05:31:18.470 --> 05:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
both for ourselves and for our children
 
05:31:20.190 --> 05:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
and I thought and I don't know if this
 
05:31:21.548 --> 05:31:21.558 align:start position:0%
is true but I thought most people would
 
05:31:24.270 --> 05:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
agree that before we mandate require a
 
05:31:26.510 --> 05:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine for people who don't want them
 
05:31:28.548 --> 05:31:28.558 align:start position:0%
for their children the vaccine would
 
05:31:30.470 --> 05:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
need to meet a minimum of three
 
05:31:32.270 --> 05:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
conditions first what we were talking
 
05:31:34.830 --> 05:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
about before it would need to be safe
 
05:31:37.470 --> 05:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
second it would be necessary to stop the
 
05:31:40.230 --> 05:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
spread of a dangerous infectious disease
 
05:31:42.788 --> 05:31:42.798 align:start position:0%
that poses a threat to Public Health
 
05:31:45.470 --> 05:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
Public Health rationale and third you
 
05:31:47.510 --> 05:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
would want before mandating a vaccine to
 
05:31:48.830 --> 05:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that it actually sort of
 
05:31:50.830 --> 05:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
satisfied that public health rationale
 
05:31:53.230 --> 05:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
that it stops transmission of the
 
05:31:55.470 --> 05:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
disease um and so what I want to submit
 
05:31:58.548 --> 05:31:58.558 align:start position:0%
to you today is that requiring um
 
05:32:00.910 --> 05:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
vaccines to stop transmission or some
 
05:32:02.190 --> 05:32:02.200 align:start position:0%
sort of proof that they can stop
 
05:32:03.350 --> 05:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
transmission whether it's through a
 
05:32:05.350 --> 05:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
clinical trial or otherwise before the
 
05:32:07.670 --> 05:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine can be mandated makes sense not
 
05:32:09.510 --> 05:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
just from an ethical standpoint but also
 
05:32:11.990 --> 05:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
from a legal standpoint and to do that I
 
05:32:13.590 --> 05:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
just want to talk briefly about the
 
05:32:15.910 --> 05:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
leading US Supreme Court case on vaccine
 
05:32:17.470 --> 05:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
mandates which some or all of you may
 
05:32:18.910 --> 05:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
have heard of it's called Jacobson
 
05:32:21.150 --> 05:32:21.160 align:start position:0%
versus Massachusetts and it's a case
 
05:32:24.150 --> 05:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
that was um that was decided in 1905 and
 
05:32:25.830 --> 05:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
has really been cited especially in
 
05:32:27.670 --> 05:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
recent years as the justification the
 
05:32:30.310 --> 05:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
legal justification for for current
 
05:32:33.070 --> 05:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates um and you know the
 
05:32:34.510 --> 05:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
case is very interesting because it's
 
05:32:36.470 --> 05:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
been interpreted by a lot of Courts very
 
05:32:38.750 --> 05:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
broadly to sort of permit any and all
 
05:32:40.788 --> 05:32:40.798 align:start position:0%
mandates but if you if you read the case
 
05:32:42.430 --> 05:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
closely and I think courts are going to
 
05:32:44.868 --> 05:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
start doing this in fact The Jacobson
 
05:32:47.670 --> 05:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
case really kind of limits the ability
 
05:32:50.510 --> 05:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
of a government to impose mandates um to
 
05:32:53.788 --> 05:32:53.798 align:start position:0%
circumstances where a vaccine stops a
 
05:32:56.670 --> 05:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
very serious um is is targeted at a very
 
05:32:58.788 --> 05:32:58.798 align:start position:0%
serious infectious disease and it
 
05:33:01.390 --> 05:33:01.400 align:start position:0%
actually stops transmission so just just
 
05:33:04.190 --> 05:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
briefly The Jacobson case was decided in
 
05:33:07.788 --> 05:33:07.798 align:start position:0%
1905 during this um a a small poox out
 
05:33:09.548 --> 05:33:09.558 align:start position:0%
break in Cambridge Massachusetts and the
 
05:33:12.510 --> 05:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
Cambridge Board of Health passed a a a
 
05:33:14.390 --> 05:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
regulation pursuant to a state statute
 
05:33:16.070 --> 05:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
that it gave it um the authority to do
 
05:33:17.628 --> 05:33:17.638 align:start position:0%
this and it said you have to have a
 
05:33:20.590 --> 05:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
small a small pox vaccine or pay a $5
 
05:33:23.190 --> 05:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
fine and Mr Jacobson was convicted of
 
05:33:25.310 --> 05:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
violating the ordinance and he argued
 
05:33:27.150 --> 05:33:27.160 align:start position:0%
all the way up to the Supreme Court that
 
05:33:29.110 --> 05:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
the requirement that he take the small
 
05:33:31.830 --> 05:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
poox uh vaccine basically violated his
 
05:33:34.070 --> 05:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
due process rights to bodily autonomy
 
05:33:37.788 --> 05:33:37.798 align:start position:0%
and to Liberty and um and so the Supreme
 
05:33:40.310 --> 05:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
Court upheld the case and um it said you
 
05:33:42.270 --> 05:33:42.280 align:start position:0%
know unequivocally that a community has
 
05:33:44.708 --> 05:33:44.718 align:start position:0%
the right to protect itself against an
 
05:33:46.670 --> 05:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
epidemic of disease that threatens the
 
05:33:49.190 --> 05:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
safety of its members and the court said
 
05:33:51.270 --> 05:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
that the rights of individuals in
 
05:33:53.190 --> 05:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
respect to their own individual liberty
 
05:33:56.830 --> 05:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
May at times of great dangers be subject
 
05:33:59.948 --> 05:33:59.958 align:start position:0%
to restraints um that the safety of the
 
05:34:02.868 --> 05:34:02.878 align:start position:0%
general public demands um and so you
 
05:34:04.670 --> 05:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
know with that in mind it upheld the
 
05:34:09.510 --> 05:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
smallpox mandate um so but what ja up
 
05:34:12.190 --> 05:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
what Jacobson doesn't say is that any
 
05:34:14.628 --> 05:34:14.638 align:start position:0%
and all mandates are allowable in fact
 
05:34:16.350 --> 05:34:16.360 align:start position:0%
what the ca what the court said
 
05:34:18.708 --> 05:34:18.718 align:start position:0%
specifically was that the the the
 
05:34:21.430 --> 05:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
Mandate was enacted because the the um
 
05:34:23.310 --> 05:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
Health Board found it necessary to
 
05:34:26.628 --> 05:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
protect the um public from the um
 
05:34:29.350 --> 05:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
disease of small pox serious disease and
 
05:34:31.110 --> 05:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
the prevailing understanding at the time
 
05:34:32.990 --> 05:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
was that the vacine prevented
 
05:34:35.990 --> 05:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
transmission of small poox and it was on
 
05:34:37.910 --> 05:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
these grounds that the court upheld it I
 
05:34:39.350 --> 05:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
just really urge you to keep that in
 
05:34:40.750 --> 05:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
mind as you're as you're considering
 
05:34:43.230 --> 05:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
this thank Youk any questions
 
05:34:45.150 --> 05:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
representative plaz off and then
 
05:34:47.830 --> 05:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative marel thank you Mr chair
 
05:34:51.030 --> 05:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
05:34:55.750 --> 05:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
we heard that uh even uh vaccines uh
 
05:35:00.510 --> 05:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
that are S as sterilizing vaccines don't
 
05:35:05.470 --> 05:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
stop 100% of transmission uh but at the
 
05:35:08.070 --> 05:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
same time maybe it's moment medical
 
05:35:11.548 --> 05:35:11.558 align:start position:0%
question but we have antibiotics we have
 
05:35:15.070 --> 05:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
antiviral uh drugs and agents and some
 
05:35:18.430 --> 05:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
other Medical Treatments that might to
 
05:35:20.868 --> 05:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
certain extent limit the
 
05:35:26.070 --> 05:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
transmission so legally speaking why we
 
05:35:30.390 --> 05:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
mandating vaccines but uh why but not
 
05:35:32.190 --> 05:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
other agents that might limit
 
05:35:34.470 --> 05:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
transmission to certain
 
05:35:39.030 --> 05:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
extent um I I'm not I'm not sure that I
 
05:35:41.310 --> 05:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
from a medical standpoint I can't can't
 
05:35:42.910 --> 05:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
answer that I mean just from a legal
 
05:35:45.708 --> 05:35:45.718 align:start position:0%
standpoint I think the justification for
 
05:35:47.990 --> 05:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines you know is that they prevent
 
05:35:50.310 --> 05:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
Transmission in some sort of unique way
 
05:35:52.070 --> 05:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
that can't be done you know that's I
 
05:35:53.788 --> 05:35:53.798 align:start position:0%
mean because you're you're you're a a
 
05:35:55.628 --> 05:35:55.638 align:start position:0%
Mand a vaccine mandate is a mandate that
 
05:35:57.990 --> 05:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
you you know allow your body to be
 
05:35:59.788 --> 05:35:59.798 align:start position:0%
penetrated with a needle and injected
 
05:36:01.390 --> 05:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
with a substance that you may or may not
 
05:36:04.628 --> 05:36:04.638 align:start position:0%
want and so to you know um to sort of
 
05:36:06.590 --> 05:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
allow the state to require that you know
 
05:36:07.830 --> 05:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
there has to be a very strong
 
05:36:09.510 --> 05:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
justification and I think the strong
 
05:36:11.470 --> 05:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
justification and actually they talked
 
05:36:13.430 --> 05:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
about that in the in the Jacobson case
 
05:36:15.430 --> 05:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
was that um it was believed that this
 
05:36:17.270 --> 05:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
was the best way of preventing the
 
05:36:18.788 --> 05:36:18.798 align:start position:0%
spread of small poox was through the
 
05:36:21.030 --> 05:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
vaccination so if it's not the best way
 
05:36:22.510 --> 05:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
then that would be another sort of you
 
05:36:24.030 --> 05:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
know reason to
 
05:36:26.230 --> 05:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
reconsider representative
 
05:36:28.670 --> 05:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
Marquel yes thank you for thank you Mr
 
05:36:30.070 --> 05:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
05:36:32.070 --> 05:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
question so basically if you're looking
 
05:36:33.670 --> 05:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
at Jacobson and what you're talking
 
05:36:35.310 --> 05:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
about the essential holding would be
 
05:36:38.430 --> 05:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
rational basis review correct um I I
 
05:36:40.230 --> 05:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
think not I mean I that that's how some
 
05:36:42.150 --> 05:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
courts have interpreted it but I think
 
05:36:43.830 --> 05:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
really if you look closely at it it
 
05:36:46.788 --> 05:36:46.798 align:start position:0%
balances the um liberty interest of the
 
05:36:49.030 --> 05:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
individual against the needs of the
 
05:36:52.070 --> 05:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
community and it determines that the you
 
05:36:54.110 --> 05:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
know that the that that under these
 
05:36:56.390 --> 05:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances um that you know that that
 
05:36:58.830 --> 05:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
the needs of the community are are are
 
05:37:01.190 --> 05:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
greater and are also served by by
 
05:37:03.390 --> 05:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
something that clearly meets the you
 
05:37:04.990 --> 05:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
know the end that it was designed for
 
05:37:06.830 --> 05:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
which was to stop disease the other
 
05:37:08.590 --> 05:37:08.600 align:start position:0%
thing I think that important to remember
 
05:37:11.070 --> 05:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
is that since Jacobson was decided the
 
05:37:13.470 --> 05:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court has recognized a whole
 
05:37:15.708 --> 05:37:15.718 align:start position:0%
host of Rights about bodily autonomy
 
05:37:18.670 --> 05:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
that were sort of unheard of in 1905
 
05:37:21.390 --> 05:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
including the right to reject unwanted
 
05:37:22.788 --> 05:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
Medical Treatments even when they're
 
05:37:25.150 --> 05:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
life-saving and so you know I I thought
 
05:37:27.548 --> 05:37:27.558 align:start position:0%
a lot of commentators are sort of urging
 
05:37:29.590 --> 05:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
the court the court system to kind of
 
05:37:32.070 --> 05:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
revisit Jacobson in light of the more
 
05:37:34.070 --> 05:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
modern case law that really is much more
 
05:37:36.510 --> 05:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
protective of of individual liberty than
 
05:37:38.590 --> 05:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
than Jacobson was but I would say that
 
05:37:41.030 --> 05:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
under you know under under Jacobson or
 
05:37:42.590 --> 05:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
under the more current case law I've
 
05:37:43.990 --> 05:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
outlined it actually I have a statement
 
05:37:45.788 --> 05:37:45.798 align:start position:0%
here which I can share with you no no
 
05:37:47.948 --> 05:37:47.958 align:start position:0%
well representative Mel do you have
 
05:37:50.030 --> 05:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
anything else uh yes I had a followup
 
05:37:52.628 --> 05:37:52.638 align:start position:0%
followup please okay thank you so but on
 
05:37:54.510 --> 05:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
the other hand what we're talking about
 
05:37:56.750 --> 05:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
here and following up with you on this
 
05:37:59.750 --> 05:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
for example passing Yoda review
 
05:38:02.910 --> 05:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
Wisconsin uh where parents have a right
 
05:38:05.110 --> 05:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
to limit their education based I'm sure
 
05:38:08.150 --> 05:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with that case okay okay
 
05:38:10.510 --> 05:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
basically that was a case where Amish
 
05:38:11.910 --> 05:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
people were allowed to terminate
 
05:38:14.628 --> 05:38:14.638 align:start position:0%
education at the eth grade uh based on
 
05:38:18.150 --> 05:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
their culture um also followup USV Lee
 
05:38:21.390 --> 05:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
which I think 1982 which also says a
 
05:38:23.230 --> 05:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
state can have a an overwhelming
 
05:38:24.948 --> 05:38:24.958 align:start position:0%
interest over can have a stronger
 
05:38:27.708 --> 05:38:27.718 align:start position:0%
interest uh outweighs the right of the
 
05:38:30.910 --> 05:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
individual but to addressing your point
 
05:38:35.070 --> 05:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
as a matter of law since um states can
 
05:38:36.948 --> 05:38:36.958 align:start position:0%
regulate for the health safety and
 
05:38:39.030 --> 05:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
well-being being uh you would agree
 
05:38:41.070 --> 05:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
would you not that states can regulate
 
05:38:42.670 --> 05:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
for the health and safety of their
 
05:38:44.830 --> 05:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
population absolutely so in other words
 
05:38:46.468 --> 05:38:46.478 align:start position:0%
you would have to agree would you not
 
05:38:51.070 --> 05:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
that if the um if this body were to pass
 
05:38:52.830 --> 05:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
this particular legislation it would
 
05:38:55.190 --> 05:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
become law it would also be
 
05:38:58.030 --> 05:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional using rational basis
 
05:39:00.230 --> 05:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
review I I'm not sure I'm following the
 
05:39:02.030 --> 05:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
question okay well in other words
 
05:39:04.110 --> 05:39:04.120 align:start position:0%
rational basis review stands for the
 
05:39:08.510 --> 05:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
proposition that uh uh a state can enact
 
05:39:10.708 --> 05:39:10.718 align:start position:0%
a regulation that is rationally related
 
05:39:13.030 --> 05:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
to a legitimate government objective so
 
05:39:14.510 --> 05:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
if it's a legitimate government
 
05:39:17.230 --> 05:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
objective in terms of vaccinations no
 
05:39:18.868 --> 05:39:18.878 align:start position:0%
matter how you treat it this this
 
05:39:21.150 --> 05:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
particular statute if it became law
 
05:39:23.030 --> 05:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
would in fact be constitutional wouldn't
 
05:39:25.948 --> 05:39:25.958 align:start position:0%
it yes that if it limited if it limited
 
05:39:28.868 --> 05:39:28.878 align:start position:0%
mandates to to to you know V vaccines
 
05:39:30.468 --> 05:39:30.478 align:start position:0%
that actually stop transmission I mean I
 
05:39:32.190 --> 05:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
think they obviously other issues that
 
05:39:34.350 --> 05:39:34.360 align:start position:0%
might might be at play but yeah but that
 
05:39:35.830 --> 05:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
that piece of it would certainly be a
 
05:39:37.990 --> 05:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction I think okay
 
05:39:40.868 --> 05:39:40.878 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you ma'am
 
05:39:40.878 --> 05:39:42.430 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you ma'am
thank

05:39:42.430 --> 05:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:39:45.350 --> 05:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Colleen
 
05:39:56.788 --> 05:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:59.948 --> 05:39:59.958 align:start position:0%
Association good afternoon
 
05:40:02.990 --> 05:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
again I'm submitting testimony again on
 
05:40:05.708 --> 05:40:05.718 align:start position:0%
behalf of over 1250 nurses who are
 
05:40:07.390 --> 05:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
members of the New Hampshire nurses ass
 
05:40:09.788 --> 05:40:09.798 align:start position:0%
Association our missions to improve the
 
05:40:11.788 --> 05:40:11.798 align:start position:0%
health of the people of New Hampshire
 
05:40:13.830 --> 05:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
I've been a nurse for over 36 years in
 
05:40:15.868 --> 05:40:15.878 align:start position:0%
multiple Public Health roles and
 
05:40:17.990 --> 05:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
witnessed the societal benefits of
 
05:40:19.910 --> 05:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccination and preventing
 
05:40:22.548 --> 05:40:22.558 align:start position:0%
death and disease over the course of
 
05:40:25.990 --> 05:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
their lifetimes us children born between
 
05:40:30.110 --> 05:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
1994 and 2018 who are vaccinated
 
05:40:31.708 --> 05:40:31.718 align:start position:0%
according to the recommended
 
05:40:35.708 --> 05:40:35.718 align:start position:0%
immunization schedule will prevent
 
05:40:39.788 --> 05:40:39.798 align:start position:0%
419 million in illnesses
 
05:40:41.948 --> 05:40:41.958 align:start position:0%
26.8 million
 
05:40:45.788 --> 05:40:45.798 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations and 93,000 deaths the
 
05:40:48.350 --> 05:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
research shows that loosening vac
 
05:40:50.948 --> 05:40:50.958 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccination requirements for
 
05:40:54.230 --> 05:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
school will decrease vaccination rates
 
05:40:56.990 --> 05:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
if you have tried to seek care recently
 
05:40:59.150 --> 05:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
you will know firsthand that New
 
05:41:00.948 --> 05:41:00.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Health Care system is
 
05:41:04.390 --> 05:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
already overburdened it is not unusual
 
05:41:07.430 --> 05:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
to wait out 8 hours to be seen in
 
05:41:10.310 --> 05:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
emergency room or months for a primary
 
05:41:10.320 --> 05:41:11.548 align:start position:0%
emergency room or months for a primary
care

05:41:11.548 --> 05:41:11.558 align:start position:0%
care
 
05:41:14.510 --> 05:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
appointment imagine how much worse
 
05:41:16.750 --> 05:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
accessing care would be with fewer
 
05:41:19.430 --> 05:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
vaccinated children not to mention the
 
05:41:21.590 --> 05:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
unnecessary deaths from vaccine
 
05:41:24.390 --> 05:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
preventable disease learning about the
 
05:41:28.150 --> 05:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
measles outbreak in Texas has been
 
05:41:31.510 --> 05:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking during January 1 to August
 
05:41:36.708 --> 05:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
15 2024 a total of 219 measel cases were
 
05:41:39.750 --> 05:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
reported in the United States exceeding
 
05:41:42.468 --> 05:41:42.478 align:start position:0%
the number of cases reported annually
 
05:41:45.430 --> 05:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
during the 2020 to 2023
 
05:41:52.548 --> 05:41:52.558 align:start position:0%
range 100 of the 219 cases 190 or
 
05:41:55.150 --> 05:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
86% were among people who were
 
05:41:58.548 --> 05:41:58.558 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination

representative

05:42:31.548 --> 05:42:31.558 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:42:33.708 --> 05:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:42:36.868 --> 05:42:36.878 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so sometimes you
 
05:42:39.070 --> 05:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
know when you when you live in a free
 
05:42:41.868 --> 05:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
Society some things can be a little bit
 
05:42:43.948 --> 05:42:43.958 align:start position:0%
inconvenient and I think that kind of
 
05:42:47.350 --> 05:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
happens when when we talk about mandates
 
05:42:50.270 --> 05:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
we certainly can mandate um and uh the
 
05:42:52.750 --> 05:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
lady who was right up before talked
 
05:42:55.230 --> 05:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
about the Jacobson case which kind of
 
05:42:57.190 --> 05:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
laid out the framework where and I'm not
 
05:42:59.830 --> 05:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
a lawyer like representative marel but
 
05:43:01.628 --> 05:43:01.638 align:start position:0%
it kind of laid out that a kind of a
 
05:43:04.350 --> 05:43:04.360 align:start position:0%
litmus test um where there has to be a
 
05:43:06.708 --> 05:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
compelling State you know interest and
 
05:43:11.990 --> 05:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
so when you look at like something like
 
05:43:15.430 --> 05:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
measles versus something like
 
05:43:20.430 --> 05:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
tness um how do you do you draw no
 
05:43:23.390 --> 05:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
distinction uh between the two uh
 
05:43:25.548 --> 05:43:25.558 align:start position:0%
relative to what we just heard in terms
 
05:43:27.628 --> 05:43:27.638 align:start position:0%
of a compelling State need or do you or
 
05:43:29.548 --> 05:43:29.558 align:start position:0%
do you do you kind of measure them the
 
05:43:32.830 --> 05:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
same way I do not because I believe that
 
05:43:35.468 --> 05:43:35.478 align:start position:0%
one death of a child is one death too
 
05:43:35.478 --> 05:43:39.670 align:start position:0%
one death of a child is one death too
many

05:43:39.670 --> 05:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:41.510 --> 05:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
see representative Castle Rings thank
 
05:43:42.868 --> 05:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I just got to ask you the
 
05:43:44.708 --> 05:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
statistics that you cited where did
 
05:43:46.190 --> 05:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
where those come from just curious so
 
05:43:47.990 --> 05:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
there yeah I I'll be handing this
 
05:43:50.430 --> 05:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
testimony in yeah but it uh there's a
 
05:43:53.708 --> 05:43:53.718 align:start position:0%
couple of resources um one is from the
 
05:44:00.510 --> 05:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:03.750 --> 05:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
2023 okay okay I'm seeing no other
 
05:44:08.110 --> 05:44:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:09.868 --> 05:44:09.878 align:start position:0%
and also signed up to speak is Melissa
 
05:44:13.030 --> 05:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
blasich from new bill New Hampshire You'
 
05:44:14.548 --> 05:44:14.558 align:start position:0%
asked for five minutes please keep it to
 
05:44:15.830 --> 05:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
three I'm
 
05:44:18.110 --> 05:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
going thank you Mr chair members of the
 
05:44:19.948 --> 05:44:19.958 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Melissa blasik I'm here
 
05:44:22.510 --> 05:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
representing rebuild NH uh sterilizing
 
05:44:24.590 --> 05:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
immunity refers to an immune response
 
05:44:26.468 --> 05:44:26.478 align:start position:0%
that completely prevents a pathogen from
 
05:44:28.868 --> 05:44:28.878 align:start position:0%
establishing an infection in a host
 
05:44:30.708 --> 05:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
effectively stopping it from replicating
 
05:44:32.868 --> 05:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
and being transmitted to others one
 
05:44:35.070 --> 05:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
could say the gold standard example of a
 
05:44:36.628 --> 05:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
vaccine like this is the small pox
 
05:44:36.638 --> 05:44:38.030 align:start position:0%
vaccine like this is the small pox
vaccine

05:44:38.030 --> 05:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
05:44:40.070 --> 05:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
um I because I'm trying to keep this
 
05:44:41.750 --> 05:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
brief obviously I think previous
 
05:44:43.510 --> 05:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
speakers have gone through a lot of the
 
05:44:45.310 --> 05:44:45.320 align:start position:0%
vaccines on the New Hampshire schedule
 
05:44:48.070 --> 05:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
that are not an example of this um last
 
05:44:49.390 --> 05:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
week I came before this committee to
 
05:44:51.350 --> 05:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
discuss a bill that did not directly
 
05:44:53.110 --> 05:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
address the merits of vaccine mandates
 
05:44:55.270 --> 05:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
and yet the subject kept getting brought
 
05:44:57.430 --> 05:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
up and I want to restate what I said
 
05:45:00.628 --> 05:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
then mandates breed skepticism and good
 
05:45:03.590 --> 05:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
ideas do not require Force I'm not here
 
05:45:05.590 --> 05:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
to discuss the personally protective
 
05:45:07.590 --> 05:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
benefits of these vaccines
 
05:45:09.430 --> 05:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
but that's what they are personally
 
05:45:11.350 --> 05:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
protective we do not mandate any other
 
05:45:12.910 --> 05:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical product with personally
 
05:45:15.150 --> 05:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
protective benefits we don't mandate
 
05:45:17.270 --> 05:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
that a diabetic take insulin or someone
 
05:45:18.830 --> 05:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
with high cholesterol take a Statin
 
05:45:20.670 --> 05:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
because people have the right to make
 
05:45:23.350 --> 05:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
their own choices about their own health
 
05:45:25.948 --> 05:45:25.958 align:start position:0%
accepting risks and taking personal
 
05:45:27.788 --> 05:45:27.798 align:start position:0%
responsibility the purpose of the
 
05:45:31.270 --> 05:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates in RSA 141c is to
 
05:45:33.670 --> 05:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
mandate vaccines of everyone who is able
 
05:45:36.230 --> 05:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
to receive a vaccine to protect those
 
05:45:37.788 --> 05:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
who are not able
 
05:45:39.150 --> 05:45:39.160 align:start position:0%
if the vaccine cannot prevent
 
05:45:41.030 --> 05:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
transmission however I believe that this
 
05:45:43.868 --> 05:45:43.878 align:start position:0%
argument is negated it is time that we
 
05:45:46.430 --> 05:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
start rethinking the idea of mandated
 
05:45:50.670 --> 05:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
vaccines and I think that hb70 uh 679 is
 
05:45:53.788 --> 05:45:53.798 align:start position:0%
a very good place to start um if I have
 
05:45:56.150 --> 05:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
a couple more minutes so uh just quickly
 
05:45:57.628 --> 05:45:57.638 align:start position:0%
go through I have some studies I'm going
 
05:46:00.750 --> 05:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
to send in but um it does appear that
 
05:46:02.230 --> 05:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
the only vaccines on the New Hampshire
 
05:46:03.948 --> 05:46:03.958 align:start position:0%
school schedule that actually do stop
 
05:46:06.670 --> 05:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
transmission are the MMR vaccine and
 
05:46:09.590 --> 05:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
Poss possibly be um but the rest of them
 
05:46:11.590 --> 05:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
do not actually have that ability these
 
05:46:13.270 --> 05:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
are personally
 
05:46:17.070 --> 05:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
protective um benefits only um that is
 
05:46:19.628 --> 05:46:19.638 align:start position:0%
it I will take any questions thank you
 
05:46:22.350 --> 05:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
representative Woods thank you Mr chair
 
05:46:24.750 --> 05:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for taking my question
 
05:46:29.670 --> 05:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh transmission is a key element but um
 
05:46:30.788 --> 05:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
can you
 
05:46:33.990 --> 05:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
identify that there is a uh would you
 
05:46:36.468 --> 05:46:36.478 align:start position:0%
agree that there is a difference between
 
05:46:40.750 --> 05:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
five % transmission and 95%
 
05:46:44.948 --> 05:46:44.958 align:start position:0%
transmission uh and the impact so just
 
05:46:47.548 --> 05:46:47.558 align:start position:0%
incorporating the term transmission
 
05:46:49.910 --> 05:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't really identify the benefit that
 
05:46:53.430 --> 05:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
one would generate would that be
 
05:46:56.830 --> 05:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
correct thank you for the question um I
 
05:46:59.230 --> 05:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying but again
 
05:47:00.510 --> 05:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
the idea of mandates again we're not
 
05:47:03.190 --> 05:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
trying to take away anybody's vaccine
 
05:47:06.350 --> 05:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
access here but the idea of mandating a
 
05:47:09.070 --> 05:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine there should be a very high
 
05:47:12.708 --> 05:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
threshold to have that type of of
 
05:47:15.708 --> 05:47:15.718 align:start position:0%
government dictate and that kind of high
 
05:47:18.948 --> 05:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
threshold should be that there is no way
 
05:47:20.270 --> 05:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
that you can give somebody who is
 
05:47:22.270 --> 05:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and can't get that vaccine
 
05:47:23.830 --> 05:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
that disease and that is simply not the
 
05:47:25.628 --> 05:47:25.638 align:start position:0%
case with the rest of these vaccines but
 
05:47:28.030 --> 05:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
I do understand what you're
 
05:47:30.830 --> 05:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
saying representative
 
05:47:32.910 --> 05:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you and thank you for taking
 
05:47:36.310 --> 05:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
my question so um so for a disease like
 
05:47:39.830 --> 05:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
technus for example um if we go back to
 
05:47:41.628 --> 05:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
the Jacobson case just because it was
 
05:47:44.910 --> 05:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
brought up and we were talking about a
 
05:47:47.948 --> 05:47:47.958 align:start position:0%
technus vaccine in
 
05:47:52.510 --> 05:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
1905 um where do you think uh the court
 
05:47:54.190 --> 05:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
would have come down at that time we
 
05:47:55.830 --> 05:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
know where they came down on small talks
 
05:47:57.590 --> 05:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
in the decision sure where do you think
 
05:47:58.868 --> 05:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
they would have come down and this is
 
05:48:01.150 --> 05:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
speculative sure um with respect to
 
05:48:02.788 --> 05:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
tetanus thank you for the question so
 
05:48:05.270 --> 05:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
tetanus is a non-communicable disease so
 
05:48:07.590 --> 05:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
it cannot spread from person to person
 
05:48:10.110 --> 05:48:10.120 align:start position:0%
so I do believe that if it if I'm
 
05:48:13.670 --> 05:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
speculating right um if it was the same
 
05:48:15.708 --> 05:48:15.718 align:start position:0%
court as Jacobson I I do not believe
 
05:48:17.150 --> 05:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
that they would have said that that met
 
05:48:19.390 --> 05:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
the threshold for to be
 
05:48:22.948 --> 05:48:22.958 align:start position:0%
mandated thank you representative paza
 
05:48:25.070 --> 05:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:48:28.910 --> 05:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if we require
 
05:48:32.030 --> 05:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
vaccines that don't stop transmission or
 
05:48:34.868 --> 05:48:34.878 align:start position:0%
increase transmission should be there
 
05:48:38.948 --> 05:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
some uh informed consent especially
 
05:48:41.230 --> 05:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
given that we heard today about some
 
05:48:45.750 --> 05:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
oncological kids who are vulnerable uh
 
05:48:48.468 --> 05:48:48.478 align:start position:0%
and uh some other situations that I know
 
05:48:51.430 --> 05:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes people vaccinate siblings to
 
05:48:55.590 --> 05:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
protect somebody imun compromised so and
 
05:48:57.868 --> 05:48:57.878 align:start position:0%
if we mandate it and if we know that
 
05:49:01.910 --> 05:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's like 5% or 90% or sometimes it's
 
05:49:05.230 --> 05:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
over 100% if it's actually in C
 
05:49:08.910 --> 05:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
transmission and I heard the it I saw
 
05:49:11.310 --> 05:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
the data that pertusus is not the only
 
05:49:15.628 --> 05:49:15.638 align:start position:0%
one that can increase transmission so
 
05:49:17.708 --> 05:49:17.718 align:start position:0%
should should we
 
05:49:20.750 --> 05:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
notify families if we are mandating
 
05:49:23.270 --> 05:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
something like that um thank you for the
 
05:49:26.628 --> 05:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
question I believe that all medical
 
05:49:29.110 --> 05:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
procedures and interventions should have
 
05:49:31.910 --> 05:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
full informed consent and I think that
 
05:49:34.830 --> 05:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
that is some of the reason why there is
 
05:49:37.830 --> 05:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine hesitancy and and skepticism
 
05:49:40.830 --> 05:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
because mandates breed skepticism but
 
05:49:43.510 --> 05:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
also because there is not typically
 
05:49:47.030 --> 05:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
fully informed consent when it comes to
 
05:49:50.350 --> 05:49:50.360 align:start position:0%
vaccines um
 
05:49:59.830 --> 05:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:02.390 --> 05:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Louise
 
05:50:04.670 --> 05:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
Spencer from Kent
 
05:50:07.270 --> 05:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
Street and I'm sorry I thought I wasn't
 
05:50:09.548 --> 05:50:09.558 align:start position:0%
going to speak again but I just had a
 
05:50:11.390 --> 05:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
couple quick things to add thank you Mr
 
05:50:14.788 --> 05:50:14.798 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you the committee um I
 
05:50:17.270 --> 05:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make a point that I think
 
05:50:22.510 --> 05:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
what really breeds distrust um is uh
 
05:50:25.190 --> 05:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
misinformation and disinformation so I
 
05:50:28.310 --> 05:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
just wanted to add that but um regarding
 
05:50:32.110 --> 05:50:32.120 align:start position:0%
my daughter who had uh whooping cough
 
05:50:34.910 --> 05:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
she was lucky in that she had had one
 
05:50:38.430 --> 05:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
dose of the vacc before she was exposed
 
05:50:41.510 --> 05:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
to a person who was undervaccinated and
 
05:50:43.868 --> 05:50:43.878 align:start position:0%
who didn't realize they had whipping
 
05:50:46.830 --> 05:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
cough um our doctor was very clear that
 
05:50:52.150 --> 05:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
had she not had that dose um she very
 
05:50:54.430 --> 05:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
well would have ended up in the hospital
 
05:50:55.788 --> 05:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
and it would have been a much more
 
05:50:58.230 --> 05:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
serious situation even though as it
 
05:51:01.628 --> 05:51:01.638 align:start position:0%
stood it was a very serious in situation
 
05:51:05.270 --> 05:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
indeed so you know we can talk about
 
05:51:07.390 --> 05:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
transmission um you know complete
 
05:51:10.110 --> 05:51:10.120 align:start position:0%
blocking of disease or we can think
 
05:51:14.830 --> 05:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
about what um you know lessening harm
 
05:51:17.670 --> 05:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
and certainly in my daughter's case you
 
05:51:21.110 --> 05:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
know having some protection was was
 
05:51:23.110 --> 05:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
probably the difference between life or
 
05:51:26.788 --> 05:51:26.798 align:start position:0%
death for her um I also I don't know if
 
05:51:29.190 --> 05:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
this committee notes the sign-ins from
 
05:51:33.270 --> 05:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
the um from the portal in and includes
 
05:51:37.948 --> 05:51:37.958 align:start position:0%
those in the um we aware of yes okay do
 
05:51:40.190 --> 05:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
they they get added to the
 
05:51:43.390 --> 05:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
record um that I don't know so I'm just
 
05:51:47.750 --> 05:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
noting that on 664 there are 205 people
 
05:51:50.990 --> 05:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
signed in um in support and
 
05:51:54.990 --> 05:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
814 signed in opposed and on this bill
 
05:51:59.868 --> 05:51:59.878 align:start position:0%
203 signed in in support and 793 signed
 
05:52:03.510 --> 05:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
in um opposed so I just thought I would
 
05:52:05.910 --> 05:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
let folks know that that's how it's
 
05:52:07.830 --> 05:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
running thank you thank you very much
 
05:52:11.110 --> 05:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
thanks very much representative bazov
 
05:52:13.430 --> 05:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:52:17.390 --> 05:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you testified how
 
05:52:21.350 --> 05:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
doctor was uh advertising vaccines to
 
05:52:26.110 --> 05:52:26.120 align:start position:0%
you and uh giving you scary data about
 
05:52:29.990 --> 05:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh the disease uh uh what what kind of
 
05:52:34.190 --> 05:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
information your doctor read to you from
 
05:52:38.430 --> 05:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine ins regarding side
 
05:52:41.150 --> 05:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
effects what information did I get about
 
05:52:44.910 --> 05:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
the side effects yeah yes doctor um I I
 
05:52:47.190 --> 05:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
actually got quite a bit of information
 
05:52:48.948 --> 05:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
about the side effects and in fact my
 
05:52:52.270 --> 05:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
daughter had um not a particularly great
 
05:52:56.390 --> 05:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
reaction to the the first dose of the
 
05:52:59.670 --> 05:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine um so we had extensive
 
05:53:03.350 --> 05:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
conversations about whether or not um
 
05:53:07.230 --> 05:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
she would get the second
 
05:53:08.830 --> 05:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
dose and the third I believe there are
 
05:53:11.910 --> 05:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
three doses um it's a little bit shaky
 
05:53:14.990 --> 05:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
In My Memory right now um the fact that
 
05:53:19.110 --> 05:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
she then developed whooping cough um he
 
05:53:21.548 --> 05:53:21.558 align:start position:0%
chose to give her the vaccine without
 
05:53:24.830 --> 05:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
the whooping cough uh component I
 
05:53:27.750 --> 05:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
believe but later as an adult she got
 
05:53:29.868 --> 05:53:29.878 align:start position:0%
the booster and had with all three
 
05:53:31.750 --> 05:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
components and had no trouble but we did
 
05:53:34.110 --> 05:53:34.120 align:start position:0%
have um my doctor was very good I have
 
05:53:35.868 --> 05:53:35.878 align:start position:0%
to say about having extensive
 
05:53:37.628 --> 05:53:37.638 align:start position:0%
discussions and then informing me what
 
05:53:40.430 --> 05:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
to look for uh when my daughter was
 
05:53:43.430 --> 05:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
crying and you know upset after that
 
05:53:46.070 --> 05:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
first dose I called my doctor and we
 
05:53:49.270 --> 05:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
discussed how to proceed also when my
 
05:53:50.628 --> 05:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
brother had
 
05:53:55.590 --> 05:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
HIV um we uh discussed at length about
 
05:53:58.190 --> 05:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
polio vaccines and how to keep him safe
 
05:54:01.310 --> 05:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
for the period of time um but since it
 
05:54:06.070 --> 05:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
was an attenuated um vaccine it it was
 
05:54:08.430 --> 05:54:08.440 align:start position:0%
Rel it was safe to him but they my
 
05:54:11.390 --> 05:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
doctor still said it's best to just not
 
05:54:12.868 --> 05:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
have contact with your brother for a
 
05:54:15.070 --> 05:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
period of time just to be extra safe
 
05:54:18.468 --> 05:54:18.478 align:start position:0%
thank you all right uh thank you very
 
05:54:21.150 --> 05:54:21.160 align:start position:0%
much thank you no one else has signed up

05:54:33.948 --> 05:54:33.958 align:start position:0%

05:54:40.548 --> 05:54:40.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:42.030 --> 05:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
I have a question that does doesn't
 
05:54:43.830 --> 05:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
pertain to any of these bills but I
 
05:54:46.590 --> 05:54:46.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask HHS should I just go over
 
05:54:49.190 --> 05:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
and ask the doctor myself sure if it
 
05:54:51.670 --> 05:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't to these bills sure okay thank
 
05:54:54.190 --> 05:54:54.200 align:start position:0%

06:03:52.708 --> 06:03:52.718 align:start position:0%
here I think everyone's
 
06:03:55.628 --> 06:03:55.638 align:start position:0%
here okay I'd like to open the executive
 
06:03:59.310 --> 06:03:59.320 align:start position:0%
session um we have we had eight bills on
 
06:04:01.788 --> 06:04:01.798 align:start position:0%
on the docket for today we've already
 
06:04:03.390 --> 06:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
exec one I don't think we're going to
 
06:04:04.788 --> 06:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
make it through the other seven in the
 
06:04:08.750 --> 06:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
next uh 35 minutes uh be a miracle if we
 
06:04:11.910 --> 06:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
did but uh as we proceed please if you
 
06:04:13.990 --> 06:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
do have anything to say please be brief
 
06:04:15.230 --> 06:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
because you know we do want to get
 
06:04:18.030 --> 06:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
through as much as we can start off with
 
06:04:20.948 --> 06:04:20.958 align:start position:0%
HB 357 representative Drew did you have
 
06:04:20.958 --> 06:04:22.190 align:start position:0%
HB 357 representative Drew did you have
a

06:04:22.190 --> 06:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:04:25.110 --> 06:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
motion I do I move that
 
06:04:27.670 --> 06:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
we OTP HB
 
06:04:31.070 --> 06:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
357 and representative delus you have
 
06:04:32.590 --> 06:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
you have a second and would you like to
 
06:04:37.070 --> 06:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:39.830 --> 06:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
I would
 
06:04:43.590 --> 06:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
um my Logic on this bill is very
 
06:04:45.430 --> 06:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
straightforward uh regardless of what
 
06:04:47.910 --> 06:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
you think about vaccines the ability of
 
06:04:49.590 --> 06:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
the government the state government to
 
06:04:51.430 --> 06:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
mandate vaccines is something that
 
06:04:52.948 --> 06:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
should be a state government
 
06:04:54.670 --> 06:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility not a rulemaking
 
06:04:57.070 --> 06:04:57.080 align:start position:0%
authority of D HHS so that's why I'm
 
06:04:59.190 --> 06:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
supporting this
 
06:05:01.788 --> 06:05:01.798 align:start position:0%
bill uh representative delus did you
 
06:05:03.110 --> 06:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
want to speak to you a second or does
 
06:05:06.430 --> 06:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak to this
 
06:05:09.590 --> 06:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:12.868 --> 06:05:12.878 align:start position:0%
Weber I just think that it's
 
06:05:12.878 --> 06:05:14.708 align:start position:0%
Weber I just think that it's
um

06:05:14.708 --> 06:05:14.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:19.110 --> 06:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
not helpful to Simply
 
06:05:21.830 --> 06:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
abandon the notion
 
06:05:21.840 --> 06:05:23.948 align:start position:0%
abandon the notion
of

06:05:23.948 --> 06:05:23.958 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:05:26.670 --> 06:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
um The rulemaking Authority that has
 
06:05:28.590 --> 06:05:28.600 align:start position:0%
served us very very well for a long
 
06:05:32.430 --> 06:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
period of time and uh which could stand
 
06:05:35.628 --> 06:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
Us in good stead if if the need presents
 
06:05:39.670 --> 06:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
presented it so uh with that I won't
 
06:05:42.030 --> 06:05:42.040 align:start position:0%
repow all the ground that's already been
 
06:05:45.070 --> 06:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
plowed but um I don't think it's I don't
 
06:05:48.590 --> 06:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
think it's a wise decision on our part
 
06:05:51.310 --> 06:05:51.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
06:05:55.310 --> 06:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
mlan yeah thank you Mr chair so um I
 
06:05:56.910 --> 06:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
think a lot has changed since 20 years
 
06:05:58.708 --> 06:05:58.718 align:start position:0%
ago when rule making Authority was
 
06:06:01.868 --> 06:06:01.878 align:start position:0%
granted and so uh we can mandate
 
06:06:03.670 --> 06:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
obviously the question is what is the
 
06:06:05.590 --> 06:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
the best way to do it I think the legisl
 
06:06:07.548 --> 06:06:07.558 align:start position:0%
is the most transparent I like that part
 
06:06:09.990 --> 06:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill I'm disappointed uh by the
 
06:06:12.350 --> 06:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
fact that uh the three vaccines that
 
06:06:13.670 --> 06:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
were brought in under rule making
 
06:06:15.230 --> 06:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
Authority were not included I think it
 
06:06:17.350 --> 06:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
would have made a clean bill so if this
 
06:06:19.390 --> 06:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
does pass and I will vote for it but if
 
06:06:21.628 --> 06:06:21.638 align:start position:0%
it does pass I will be bringing in a
 
06:06:23.948 --> 06:06:23.958 align:start position:0%
legislation next year to bring in uh the
 
06:06:26.430 --> 06:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
other three
 
06:06:28.628 --> 06:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
vaccines representative
 
06:06:31.590 --> 06:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
Weber how about we put this off till
 
06:06:35.910 --> 06:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
next week and bring in the amendment now
 
06:06:37.910 --> 06:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
I I'm not going to bring in an amendment
 
06:06:39.628 --> 06:06:39.638 align:start position:0%
and and the reason I'm not going to do
 
06:06:42.310 --> 06:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
that is the prime sponsor asked me not
 
06:06:44.590 --> 06:06:44.600 align:start position:0%
to who has obviously done a lot more
 
06:06:47.190 --> 06:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
research with these vaccines than I have
 
06:06:49.548 --> 06:06:49.558 align:start position:0%
so out of respect to him I said I would
 
06:06:54.390 --> 06:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
not uh bring it in that being said um I
 
06:06:56.110 --> 06:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
I don't have the same reservations he
 
06:06:57.910 --> 06:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
does and I will bring them in uh next
 
06:07:01.190 --> 06:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
year uh just to test out the new
 
06:07:03.868 --> 06:07:03.878 align:start position:0%
system anyone else before we go to a
 
06:07:07.110 --> 06:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
vote representative lontine
 
06:07:14.070 --> 06:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
or yes I I think that uh the inability
 
06:07:16.910 --> 06:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
of the state legislature to be able to
 
06:07:21.430 --> 06:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
act swiftly if there is an outbreak
 
06:07:25.628 --> 06:07:25.638 align:start position:0%
um DHHS you know opposed the bill for
 
06:07:29.070 --> 06:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
for that reason um I I don't think that
 
06:07:31.430 --> 06:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
the state legislature is really the
 
06:07:31.440 --> 06:07:32.670 align:start position:0%
the state legislature is really the
appropriate

06:07:32.670 --> 06:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
06:07:35.948 --> 06:07:35.958 align:start position:0%
place for to make decisions
 
06:07:39.510 --> 06:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
in public health emergencies and in um
 
06:07:42.070 --> 06:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
the specifics
 
06:07:45.590 --> 06:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
of um you know vaccine
 
06:07:48.430 --> 06:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
policy so I'm going to oppose the bill
 
06:07:49.990 --> 06:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
um quickly representative woods and
 
06:07:53.110 --> 06:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative hartnet well just just my
 
06:07:56.070 --> 06:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
personal flavor here I think this is
 
06:07:58.468 --> 06:07:58.478 align:start position:0%
I'll say it strongly an egregious
 
06:08:00.868 --> 06:08:00.878 align:start position:0%
misfire on the practice of
 
06:08:05.750 --> 06:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
medicine to subject
 
06:08:08.788 --> 06:08:08.798 align:start position:0%
like with Barella with the
 
06:08:10.948 --> 06:08:10.958 align:start position:0%
chickenpox you've not had the chance to
 
06:08:13.190 --> 06:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
treat people who had reflex sympathetic
 
06:08:19.628 --> 06:08:19.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:22.830 --> 06:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
unbelievable taking this out would
 
06:08:25.468 --> 06:08:25.478 align:start position:0%
subject U
 
06:08:30.190 --> 06:08:30.200 align:start position:0%
kids to this some of the others as well
 
06:08:35.190 --> 06:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
but to me uh we we want to protect the
 
06:08:36.708 --> 06:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
public public and we want to have the
 
06:08:40.430 --> 06:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
public have a choice for
 
06:08:42.590 --> 06:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
sure but we have to be careful that
 
06:08:44.468 --> 06:08:44.478 align:start position:0%
we're not making choices for other
 
06:08:44.478 --> 06:08:47.910 align:start position:0%
we're not making choices for other
people

06:08:47.910 --> 06:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:51.590 --> 06:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
too not just for ourselves and trust me
 
06:08:53.868 --> 06:08:53.878 align:start position:0%
when I'm taking care of patients that I
 
06:08:57.708 --> 06:08:57.718 align:start position:0%
pick on RSD refect sympathetic distrophy
 
06:09:00.708 --> 06:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
uh and that and that's you once you have
 
06:09:03.390 --> 06:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
it I mean it the the the virus stays in
 
06:09:06.590 --> 06:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
you that's how you get shingles
 
06:09:08.468 --> 06:09:08.478 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's just the itchy itchy
 
06:09:11.750 --> 06:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
itchy uh but trust me uh it's it's
 
06:09:14.230 --> 06:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
debilitating if you get it I mean uh I
 
06:09:17.110 --> 06:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
won't go into a great detail but to me
 
06:09:19.190 --> 06:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
this we have to be very careful of
 
06:09:22.310 --> 06:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
trying to practice medicine and this is
 
06:09:24.590 --> 06:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
really this is really bad
 
06:09:27.628 --> 06:09:27.638 align:start position:0%
medicine representative hartnet yeah not
 
06:09:29.590 --> 06:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
to belabor the point I agree with
 
06:09:32.310 --> 06:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
representative lontine we don't we
 
06:09:33.830 --> 06:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be in effect practicing
 
06:09:35.670 --> 06:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
medicine it's really we need to leave
 
06:09:37.868 --> 06:09:37.878 align:start position:0%
that to the people in the department and
 
06:09:40.030 --> 06:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
if we object to what they're doing then
 
06:09:41.788 --> 06:09:41.798 align:start position:0%
you know they should move
 
06:09:41.798 --> 06:09:43.628 align:start position:0%
you know they should move
on

06:09:43.628 --> 06:09:43.638 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:09:46.310 --> 06:09:46.320 align:start position:0%

second the motion representative McGrath
 
06:11:30.670 --> 06:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your
 
06:11:34.468 --> 06:11:34.478 align:start position:0%
motion sure my understanding is um the
 
06:11:34.478 --> 06:11:36.070 align:start position:0%
motion sure my understanding is um the
original

06:11:36.070 --> 06:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
original
 
06:11:40.270 --> 06:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
Bill inadvertently created a specific
 
06:11:42.510 --> 06:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
form that had to be filled out this just
 
06:11:44.990 --> 06:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
takes away the requirement for a
 
06:11:50.110 --> 06:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:53.510 --> 06:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
form okay anyone
 
06:11:56.310 --> 06:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
else represented
 
06:11:59.430 --> 06:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
Weber we were presented with Co copies
 
06:12:02.510 --> 06:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
of the government form which were simple
 
06:12:05.270 --> 06:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
clear and provided clear opt outs and I
 
06:12:07.670 --> 06:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
see no reason to change what wasn't
 
06:12:09.670 --> 06:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
broken to begin
 
06:12:13.910 --> 06:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
with representative Woods uh yes um I
 
06:12:15.990 --> 06:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
will vote against this just on the basis
 
06:12:19.390 --> 06:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
of the uh one of our charges is the
 
06:12:19.400 --> 06:12:21.670 align:start position:0%
of the uh one of our charges is the
public

06:12:21.670 --> 06:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
public
 
06:12:25.670 --> 06:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
good to to do that we need information
 
06:12:25.680 --> 06:12:26.510 align:start position:0%
good to to do that we need information
good

06:12:26.510 --> 06:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
good
 
06:12:29.468 --> 06:12:29.478 align:start position:0%
information and one of the ways we do it
 
06:12:32.910 --> 06:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
is with simple forms not a big complex
 
06:12:36.788 --> 06:12:36.798 align:start position:0%
form but a simple form and by collecting
 
06:12:40.948 --> 06:12:40.958 align:start position:0%
information on this sheet it helps us do
 
06:12:43.990 --> 06:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
our job for the public
 
06:12:48.190 --> 06:12:48.200 align:start position:0%
good and um I appreciate the fact that
 
06:12:50.788 --> 06:12:50.798 align:start position:0%
it's simple just to scratch something on
 
06:12:53.708 --> 06:12:53.718 align:start position:0%
a piece of paper but if my kid wanted to
 
06:12:57.548 --> 06:12:57.558 align:start position:0%
go on a field trip would be a form like
 
06:13:00.948 --> 06:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
that not just a scratch piece of paper
 
06:13:05.310 --> 06:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
and I think we can at least do the same
 
06:13:10.150 --> 06:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
we would do for our patients and our um
 
06:13:13.110 --> 06:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
constituents that we would do for our
 
06:13:13.120 --> 06:13:15.030 align:start position:0%
constituents that we would do for our
kids

06:13:15.030 --> 06:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
kids
 
06:13:18.548 --> 06:13:18.558 align:start position:0%

keep it simple um it's literally uh line
 
06:15:27.670 --> 06:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
nine it changed the word sex to
 
06:15:31.708 --> 06:15:31.718 align:start position:0%
biological sex the definition and then
 
06:15:37.030 --> 06:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
lines um 17 through 26 it just um in
 
06:15:40.230 --> 06:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
speaking with uh lawyers afterward it
 
06:15:42.590 --> 06:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
aligned the substantiative pro
 
06:15:45.910 --> 06:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
prohibition language with the SP Sketti
 
06:15:49.830 --> 06:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case so um when and if
 
06:15:51.948 --> 06:15:51.958 align:start position:0%
that passes this legislation will
 
06:15:54.910 --> 06:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
already be in line with
 
06:16:00.070 --> 06:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:00.080 --> 06:16:02.628 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

06:16:02.628 --> 06:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
06:16:17.230 --> 06:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:33.830 --> 06:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:13.270 --> 06:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:15.430 --> 06:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh Weber's amendment is
 
06:17:18.468 --> 06:17:18.478 align:start position:0%
coming around representative masers is
 
06:17:21.110 --> 06:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
on the floor right now for the
 
06:17:23.990 --> 06:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
committee as everybody had a well let me
 
06:17:25.150 --> 06:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
know when you've had a chance to read
 
06:17:27.468 --> 06:17:27.478 align:start position:0%
representative maser's Amendment and uh
 
06:17:31.230 --> 06:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:34.270 --> 06:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
discuss which one are we working on um
 
06:17:36.390 --> 06:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
five six
 
06:17:38.708 --> 06:17:38.718 align:start position:0%
26 37
 
06:17:38.718 --> 06:17:40.590 align:start position:0%
26 37
377

06:17:40.590 --> 06:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
377
 
06:17:44.070 --> 06:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
9566 0956 H is representative ma that
 
06:17:47.390 --> 06:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
one 0926 is representative
 
06:17:51.788 --> 06:17:51.798 align:start position:0%
926 is representative wers yes that's
 
06:17:54.670 --> 06:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
why they're very close in
 
06:18:04.868 --> 06:18:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:07.070 --> 06:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
I may not have very sorry I'm I'm seeing
 
06:18:09.628 --> 06:18:09.638 align:start position:0%
significant differences between this and
 
06:18:13.868 --> 06:18:13.878 align:start position:0%
what was originally proposed yep because
 
06:18:15.708 --> 06:18:15.718 align:start position:0%
I mentioned it aligns just with the
 
06:18:19.830 --> 06:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
Sketti case so it's exact language from
 
06:18:24.110 --> 06:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
that but it it um includes definition of
 
06:18:27.230 --> 06:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
person that were not included in the
 
06:18:33.030 --> 06:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:36.628 --> 06:18:36.638 align:start position:0%
includes significant
 
06:18:39.350 --> 06:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
changes uh based on a case that I have
 
06:18:42.948 --> 06:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
not read um and I just wanted to note
 
06:18:45.270 --> 06:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
that there were significant differences
 
06:18:50.030 --> 06:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
if I may uh I I would speak about it if
 
06:18:52.868 --> 06:18:52.878 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate representative um my
 
06:18:56.430 --> 06:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
my concern is um as one who opposed the
 
06:19:00.150 --> 06:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
underlying bill I also oppose the
 
06:19:02.510 --> 06:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
amendment because I think the intent is
 
06:19:06.670 --> 06:19:06.680 align:start position:0%
the same and I think that the um
 
06:19:09.868 --> 06:19:09.878 align:start position:0%
although I have not
 
06:19:16.110 --> 06:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
actually um analized the amendment in
 
06:19:18.708 --> 06:19:18.718 align:start position:0%
depth I believe that the effect of the
 
06:19:20.750 --> 06:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
amendment as of the bill is going to be
 
06:19:23.468 --> 06:19:23.478 align:start position:0%
very harmful for people who are
 
06:19:27.750 --> 06:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
deserving of our care and our welcoming
 
06:19:30.830 --> 06:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
and our acceptance and are deserving of
 
06:19:33.150 --> 06:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
good medical care to the best of the
 
06:19:35.150 --> 06:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
standards and abilities that we have at
 
06:19:37.628 --> 06:19:37.638 align:start position:0%
this point in time and therefore I'm
 
06:19:40.390 --> 06:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:45.150 --> 06:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:49.150 --> 06:19:49.160 align:start position:0%
amendment uh uh 0956 representative me's
 
06:19:52.830 --> 06:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:55.190 --> 06:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
377 representative palaz off and then
 
06:19:56.708 --> 06:19:56.718 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer and then
 
06:19:59.350 --> 06:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
representative lontine uh thank you Mr
 
06:20:02.270 --> 06:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
chair I agree that there are some
 
06:20:05.350 --> 06:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
language changes uh from original Bill
 
06:20:09.030 --> 06:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
line 17 to 21 but uh definition of
 
06:20:11.990 --> 06:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
person was included in original bill and
 
06:20:15.750 --> 06:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's included also in representative
 
06:20:19.190 --> 06:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
Weber Amendment as well so person is in
 
06:20:21.708 --> 06:20:21.718 align:start position:0%
the original Bill I'm sorry you're quite
 
06:20:23.548 --> 06:20:23.558 align:start position:0%
you're quite right my eyeballs bounc
 
06:20:24.788 --> 06:20:24.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for the correction
 
06:20:27.190 --> 06:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
representative pmer um this is sort of a
 
06:20:31.390 --> 06:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
procedural question because um
 
06:20:34.110 --> 06:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative Weber's bill has
 
06:20:35.270 --> 06:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
something that I I think is very
 
06:20:36.948 --> 06:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
important which is if you have someone
 
06:20:40.030 --> 06:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
who's in the in midtreatment
 
06:20:44.510 --> 06:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
um allowing for that to continue is is
 
06:20:46.868 --> 06:20:46.878 align:start position:0%
pretty important um and I'm just
 
06:20:49.670 --> 06:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
wondering whether we'll if
 
06:20:52.070 --> 06:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
we will we get a chance to vote on that
 
06:20:54.350 --> 06:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes oh yes we have to do this
 
06:20:56.990 --> 06:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
one first yeah they I mean we have to
 
06:20:58.390 --> 06:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
deal with what's on the you know before
 
06:21:01.310 --> 06:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
us at the moment and if I may Mr
 
06:21:04.230 --> 06:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
chairman once once we have finished
 
06:21:04.240 --> 06:21:05.070 align:start position:0%
chairman once once we have finished
passing

06:21:05.070 --> 06:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
passing
 
06:21:08.070 --> 06:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
all the things we have passed um if we
 
06:21:11.830 --> 06:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
were to pass more than one OS would uh
 
06:21:14.830 --> 06:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
to the extent possible
 
06:21:17.190 --> 06:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
integrate and they're not they're not
 
06:21:19.708 --> 06:21:19.718 align:start position:0%
mutually exclusive because the language
 
06:21:21.270 --> 06:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
of one and the language of other the
 
06:21:23.548 --> 06:21:23.558 align:start position:0%
other aren't the same
 
06:21:26.750 --> 06:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
issues representative
 
06:21:29.750 --> 06:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
lontine um yeah I'm a little concerned
 
06:21:34.230 --> 06:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
by the addition of biological sex um
 
06:21:37.190 --> 06:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
because there are some uh infants born
 
06:21:41.110 --> 06:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
with ambiguous genitalia that might be
 
06:21:43.990 --> 06:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
considered what you call hermaphrodite
 
06:21:46.430 --> 06:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
or sometimes referred to Middle sex
 
06:21:48.910 --> 06:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
that's so if that
 
06:21:54.310 --> 06:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
child um were to pursue some of these
 
06:21:54.320 --> 06:21:56.390 align:start position:0%
child um were to pursue some of these
treatments

06:21:56.390 --> 06:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
treatments
 
06:21:59.510 --> 06:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
um that that last Clause as a perception
 
06:22:01.468 --> 06:22:01.478 align:start position:0%
is inconsistent with the Minor's
 
06:22:05.310 --> 06:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
biological sex as defined in this
 
06:22:07.670 --> 06:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
chapter um it's not really clear how the
 
06:22:10.590 --> 06:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
rules would apply in that case and
 
06:22:12.190 --> 06:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
you're sort of limiting what their
 
06:22:15.110 --> 06:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
options are and what the parent might
 
06:22:17.830 --> 06:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
pursue in order to help that child
 
06:22:20.868 --> 06:22:20.878 align:start position:0%
transition through puberty because there
 
06:22:23.628 --> 06:22:23.638 align:start position:0%
they could be you don't know what their
 
06:22:26.270 --> 06:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
biological sex is it's
 
06:22:29.030 --> 06:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
ambiguous and if it often doesn't um
 
06:22:31.868 --> 06:22:31.878 align:start position:0%
become clear until a child goes through
 
06:22:34.510 --> 06:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
puberty that they're leaning one way or
 
06:22:35.510 --> 06:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
or the
 
06:22:38.548 --> 06:22:38.558 align:start position:0%
other and these are children who really
 
06:22:44.030 --> 06:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
are going to need some help as are all
 
06:22:46.628 --> 06:22:46.638 align:start position:0%
of the children who consider some
 
06:22:46.638 --> 06:22:48.070 align:start position:0%
of the children who consider some
themselves

06:22:48.070 --> 06:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
06:22:50.150 --> 06:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
trans but
 
06:22:53.590 --> 06:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
you it's very broad representative merer
 
06:22:56.628 --> 06:22:56.638 align:start position:0%
it does say you know down on 20 line 27
 
06:22:59.830 --> 06:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
and 28 that um shall not apply to a
 
06:23:01.468 --> 06:23:01.478 align:start position:0%
procedure undertaken to treat a minor
 
06:23:03.390 --> 06:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
born with born with a medically
 
06:23:06.150 --> 06:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
verifiable disorder of sex development
 
06:23:11.750 --> 06:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:14.750 --> 06:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
there anyone else representative Woods
 
06:23:18.070 --> 06:23:18.080 align:start position:0%

06:23:21.830 --> 06:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
line 18 it says so says
 
06:23:24.990 --> 06:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
engage among other things Council uh
 
06:23:28.910 --> 06:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
Council can be you know either for or
 
06:23:35.788 --> 06:23:35.798 align:start position:0%
line 18 sorry um I'm sorry U okay wait

with my apologies my
 
06:23:47.150 --> 06:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
apologies anyone else oh I had another
 
06:23:51.230 --> 06:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
the issue about biologic sex uh uh this
 
06:23:55.070 --> 06:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
is a true story uh came up at uh
 
06:23:57.110 --> 06:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
actually Health and Human Services uh
 
06:24:00.350 --> 06:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
committee uh a lady in her
 
06:24:03.750 --> 06:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
mid-30s um arrived for fertility
 
06:24:03.760 --> 06:24:04.990 align:start position:0%
mid-30s um arrived for fertility
evaluation

06:24:04.990 --> 06:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
06:24:07.990 --> 06:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
turns out after investigation she was
 
06:24:11.350 --> 06:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
not she she was a he was married and
 
06:24:13.510 --> 06:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't get pregnant but turns out she
 
06:24:13.520 --> 06:24:14.990 align:start position:0%
couldn't get pregnant but turns out she
was

06:24:14.990 --> 06:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:24:17.628 --> 06:24:17.638 align:start position:0%
a biologic
 
06:24:24.030 --> 06:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
he and um the question is if in fact who
 
06:24:25.830 --> 06:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
determines the biologic
 
06:24:29.230 --> 06:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
sex in that situation someone determined
 
06:24:32.310 --> 06:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
that this individual was a she but turns
 
06:24:35.670 --> 06:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
out was a he had undescended testicles
 
06:24:38.590 --> 06:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
uh and everything let's just say that uh
 
06:24:39.590 --> 06:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
this was a
 
06:24:43.070 --> 06:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
13-year-old who uh made the appearance
 
06:24:46.548 --> 06:24:46.558 align:start position:0%
as a female uh and in during the
 
06:24:48.750 --> 06:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
evaluation uh wanted
 
06:24:53.430 --> 06:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
to make that change um again understand
 
06:24:55.510 --> 06:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
we're having a good discussion very
 
06:24:58.390 --> 06:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
broad sort of a cultural discussion and
 
06:25:01.230 --> 06:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
I think that's healthy uh but I just
 
06:25:04.548 --> 06:25:04.558 align:start position:0%
have concerns because all of us that are
 
06:25:07.548 --> 06:25:07.558 align:start position:0%
at least Physicians no we treat the
 
06:25:10.948 --> 06:25:10.958 align:start position:0%
individual uh and unfortunately I think
 
06:25:13.750 --> 06:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
although some of this is well intended
 
06:25:15.310 --> 06:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to sweep everybody under
 
06:25:18.628 --> 06:25:18.638 align:start position:0%
the same rug and I have some concerns
 
06:25:21.468 --> 06:25:21.478 align:start position:0%
representative merer yeah again I'll
 
06:25:23.590 --> 06:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
repeat it
 
06:25:26.510 --> 06:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
mentions miners born with a medically
 
06:25:28.830 --> 06:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
verifiable disorder of sex development
 
06:25:31.350 --> 06:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
that sounds to me like that would fall
 
06:25:31.360 --> 06:25:32.868 align:start position:0%
that sounds to me like that would fall
under

06:25:32.868 --> 06:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
under
 
06:25:34.750 --> 06:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
that represent
 
06:25:39.110 --> 06:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
Weber and I'm just going to say that the
 
06:25:41.510 --> 06:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
definition of disorders of sex
 
06:25:44.390 --> 06:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
development in 332m Colon
 
06:25:49.948 --> 06:25:49.958 align:start position:0%
2 uh is a list and it's not it doesn't
 
06:25:51.830 --> 06:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
provide for anything that isn't on the
 
06:25:55.270 --> 06:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
list so the list includes 46xx
 
06:25:57.270 --> 06:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
chromosomes with or without
 
06:25:57.280 --> 06:25:58.910 align:start position:0%
chromosomes with or without
viralization

06:25:58.910 --> 06:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
viralization
 
06:26:01.270 --> 06:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
viralization presence of both aarian and
 
06:26:03.788 --> 06:26:03.798 align:start position:0%
testicular tissue other abnormal sex
 
06:26:03.798 --> 06:26:04.910 align:start position:0%
testicular tissue other abnormal sex
chromos

06:26:04.910 --> 06:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
chromos
 
06:26:08.270 --> 06:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
structures abnormal sex steroid hormone
 
06:26:10.708 --> 06:26:10.718 align:start position:0%
hormone production or action or
 
06:26:13.750 --> 06:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
ambiguous genitalia I don't know if that
 
06:26:16.788 --> 06:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
covers the entire range of
 
06:26:19.948 --> 06:26:19.958 align:start position:0%
possibilities but what we have heard in
 
06:26:22.310 --> 06:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
testimony is that there seem to be an
 
06:26:26.670 --> 06:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
inverinate variety of possibilities and
 
06:26:30.910 --> 06:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
I would be very sorry to restrict to
 
06:26:34.948 --> 06:26:34.958 align:start position:0%
just those if there are in fact
 
06:26:38.510 --> 06:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh individuals who have other conditions
 
06:26:41.548 --> 06:26:41.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:44.030 --> 06:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
treatment representative
 
06:26:47.190 --> 06:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
lontine yes swallowing up with rep
 
06:26:50.628 --> 06:26:50.638 align:start position:0%
Weber's comments like how do we not how
 
06:26:53.390 --> 06:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
do we know that gender dysphoria which
 
06:26:56.510 --> 06:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony from many parents
 
06:26:59.628 --> 06:26:59.638 align:start position:0%
saying that their child asserting
 
06:27:02.270 --> 06:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
themselves to be of the opposite sex
 
06:27:04.830 --> 06:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
from which they were born
 
06:27:06.150 --> 06:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
that that is
 
06:27:08.910 --> 06:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
not something the inherent that they
 
06:27:10.628 --> 06:27:10.638 align:start position:0%
were born
 
06:27:17.110 --> 06:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:21.070 --> 06:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
dysphoria and why why are we saying that
 
06:27:22.430 --> 06:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
06:27:28.628 --> 06:27:28.638 align:start position:0%
deny treatment and medical care for that
 
06:27:31.150 --> 06:27:31.160 align:start position:0%
individual I feel like this bill is
 
06:27:31.160 --> 06:27:32.948 align:start position:0%
individual I feel like this bill is
essentially

06:27:32.948 --> 06:27:32.958 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
06:27:35.628 --> 06:27:35.638 align:start position:0%
saying what whatever their experience is
 
06:27:39.830 --> 06:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
not real and we do not believe you we do
 
06:27:39.840 --> 06:27:40.708 align:start position:0%
not real and we do not believe you we do
not

06:27:40.708 --> 06:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:27:44.910 --> 06:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
believe um any of the the treatments and
 
06:27:47.670 --> 06:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
therapies that have happened of
 
06:27:50.910 --> 06:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
which all of the the
 
06:27:55.070 --> 06:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
parents and trans children who came to
 
06:27:57.430 --> 06:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
testify were very
 
06:27:59.948 --> 06:27:59.958 align:start position:0%
happy with their process that they have
 
06:28:02.548 --> 06:28:02.558 align:start position:0%
gone through and the
 
06:28:05.110 --> 06:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
adults and you're this bill is
 
06:28:07.788 --> 06:28:07.798 align:start position:0%
essentially saying we don't believe
 
06:28:11.830 --> 06:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
you're real and we don't uh believe that
 
06:28:14.548 --> 06:28:14.558 align:start position:0%
you're entitled to this Medical Care
 
06:28:18.628 --> 06:28:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:21.310 --> 06:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
choice okay I one one one one more
 
06:28:22.948 --> 06:28:22.958 align:start position:0%
comment I mean we've got two amendments
 
06:28:27.830 --> 06:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:32.070 --> 06:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
McGrath um I don't think that's the
 
06:28:37.030 --> 06:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
focus of where we're going with the
 
06:28:41.230 --> 06:28:41.240 align:start position:0%
bill I think the focus is just how
 
06:28:44.468 --> 06:28:44.478 align:start position:0%
powerful and dangerous these medications
 
06:28:49.110 --> 06:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:52.150 --> 06:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
examples every women woman undergoing
 
06:28:57.230 --> 06:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
menopause at a certain time would get
 
06:29:01.590 --> 06:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
estrogens now nobody gets estrogens
 
06:29:04.150 --> 06:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
because they're dangerous
 
06:29:06.750 --> 06:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
it's extremely rare for a doctor to
 
06:29:06.760 --> 06:29:08.670 align:start position:0%
it's extremely rare for a doctor to
prescribe

06:29:08.670 --> 06:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
prescribe
 
06:29:11.350 --> 06:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
estrogens to a
 
06:29:15.350 --> 06:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
patient another example
 
06:29:20.590 --> 06:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
is the um teenage boys that were taking
 
06:29:22.788 --> 06:29:22.798 align:start position:0%
hormones to build up their
 
06:29:25.310 --> 06:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
muscles and how
 
06:29:28.510 --> 06:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
dangerous everybody found out it was
 
06:29:31.430 --> 06:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
with the the Roid Rage that was
 
06:29:33.430 --> 06:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
happening and they were beating up their
 
06:29:36.350 --> 06:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
girlfriends or whatever the stories
 
06:29:41.990 --> 06:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:44.948 --> 06:29:44.958 align:start position:0%
about yeah we can affirm the kids and
 
06:29:47.628 --> 06:29:47.638 align:start position:0%
love the kids but let's let them wait
 
06:29:50.310 --> 06:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
till they're older to get to assume the
 
06:29:54.670 --> 06:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
risk of what of what these drugs do to
 
06:29:57.310 --> 06:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
them all right thank you I know there's
 
06:29:59.750 --> 06:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
um one quick comment represent hard
 
06:30:01.270 --> 06:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
because part of the reason I'm rushing
 
06:30:02.948 --> 06:30:02.958 align:start position:0%
is because I want to get you out of here
 
06:30:04.910 --> 06:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
okay um I'm you know to be honest with
 
06:30:06.708 --> 06:30:06.718 align:start position:0%
you I'm just struggling with the bills
 
06:30:08.390 --> 06:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
and the Amendments coming at as quickly
 
06:30:11.590 --> 06:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
but if I think about the original Bill
 
06:30:13.310 --> 06:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
the original bill was really about
 
06:30:16.030 --> 06:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
medicine we don't want medicine when I
 
06:30:18.628 --> 06:30:18.638 align:start position:0%
read the amendment now what I'm reading
 
06:30:20.750 --> 06:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
is well we don't want you talking about
 
06:30:23.468 --> 06:30:23.478 align:start position:0%
this uh with a young person it's just
 
06:30:26.270 --> 06:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
you see that well what's what is line 23
 
06:30:30.670 --> 06:30:30.680 align:start position:0%
and 2 through 25 mean enabling a minor
 
06:30:32.788 --> 06:30:32.798 align:start position:0%
to identify with or live as a reported
 
06:30:34.910 --> 06:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
ident in system with the minus
 
06:30:37.070 --> 06:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
biological sex treating purported
 
06:30:40.468 --> 06:30:40.478 align:start position:0%
discomfort or distress yeah but that
 
06:30:43.628 --> 06:30:43.638 align:start position:0%
that leads in from the first
 
06:30:47.910 --> 06:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph about the hormones and sex
 
06:30:49.948 --> 06:30:49.958 align:start position:0%
Lacross seex hormones and puberty
 
06:30:53.750 --> 06:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
blockers that enable a minor to identify
 
06:30:56.990 --> 06:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
with so those two points pertain to the
 
06:31:00.830 --> 06:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
first paragraph that are specific to the
 
06:31:03.708 --> 06:31:03.718 align:start position:0%
medications that enable this yeah I just
 
06:31:07.190 --> 06:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh I I guess I'm reading this further as
 
06:31:11.110 --> 06:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
just flat out anti-trans legislation
 
06:31:12.910 --> 06:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to read it best yeah it
 
06:31:14.510 --> 06:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
is not that I don't you're welcome to
 
06:31:16.468 --> 06:31:16.478 align:start position:0%
read I don't think any of us are going
 
06:31:18.270 --> 06:31:18.280 align:start position:0%
to change each other's mind is that a
 
06:31:18.280 --> 06:31:19.590 align:start position:0%
to change each other's mind is that a
fair

06:31:19.590 --> 06:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
fair
 
06:31:22.948 --> 06:31:22.958 align:start position:0%
statement um so and again representative
 
06:31:24.230 --> 06:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
haret I
 
06:31:27.510 --> 06:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
know you know this is why I'm trying to
 
06:31:30.030 --> 06:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
get this thing done for it you know I I
 
06:31:31.548 --> 06:31:31.558 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's going to matter at
 
06:31:34.548 --> 06:31:34.558 align:start position:0%
this point if we debate it further
 
06:31:38.788 --> 06:31:38.798 align:start position:0%
with respect chairman he has to leave so
 
06:31:42.070 --> 06:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
that's I understand that but I am not
 
06:31:43.548 --> 06:31:43.558 align:start position:0%
going to let that statement go
 
06:31:46.070 --> 06:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
unchallenged because the people to whom
 
06:31:46.080 --> 06:31:46.948 align:start position:0%
unchallenged because the people to whom
this

06:31:46.948 --> 06:31:46.958 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:31:49.628 --> 06:31:49.638 align:start position:0%
matters is our
 
06:31:51.948 --> 06:31:51.958 align:start position:0%
constituents and their
 
06:31:55.468 --> 06:31:55.478 align:start position:0%
children who came to us and said this
 
06:32:00.948 --> 06:32:00.958 align:start position:0%
treatment is necessary to them and has
 
06:32:04.708 --> 06:32:04.718 align:start position:0%
enabled them to live Better Lives lives
 
06:32:06.910 --> 06:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
and we had overwhelming testimony in
 
06:32:10.070 --> 06:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
that respect and so to say that whatever
 
06:32:13.270 --> 06:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
we say here doesn't matter to anybody it
 
06:32:15.868 --> 06:32:15.878 align:start position:0%
matters to them that was not my
 
06:32:17.750 --> 06:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
intention representative weo I was just
 
06:32:20.830 --> 06:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
say I understand that but I need them
 
06:32:22.990 --> 06:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
anyone who's watching this to hear that
 
06:32:26.948 --> 06:32:26.958 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to say if that were the we
 
06:32:28.548 --> 06:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
could we could keep going on this for
 
06:32:31.830 --> 06:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
another hour but we are acknowledging
 
06:32:34.110 --> 06:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
that representative Harnet has to leave
 
06:32:35.468 --> 06:32:35.478 align:start position:0%
so that's why we are trying to get
 
06:32:37.030 --> 06:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
through this I could we could talk about
 
06:32:39.628 --> 06:32:39.638 align:start position:0%
this for another hour we're not because
 
06:32:41.830 --> 06:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
of that my only point for anyone who hit
 
06:32:44.948 --> 06:32:44.958 align:start position:0%
is hearing my comments is I think every
 
06:32:46.310 --> 06:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
member of the committee pretty much
 
06:32:48.430 --> 06:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
knows how they're going to vote on this
 
06:32:50.510 --> 06:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's true uh and that that's my only
 
06:32:52.548 --> 06:32:52.558 align:start position:0%
Point uh no disrespect intended to
 
06:32:55.110 --> 06:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
anyone who testified or any opposing
 
06:32:57.468 --> 06:32:57.478 align:start position:0%
points of view representative TS I just
 
06:32:59.468 --> 06:32:59.478 align:start position:0%
want to make one last comment that
 
06:33:01.830 --> 06:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
despite everyone's positions that uh
 
06:33:04.030 --> 06:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
this is counter to Medical Practice and
 
06:33:06.310 --> 06:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
evidence and psychological knowledge
 
06:33:08.070 --> 06:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
just regardless of what your own beliefs
 
06:33:10.590 --> 06:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
might be so it's it's just not
 
06:33:12.670 --> 06:33:12.680 align:start position:0%
evidence-based okay I think at this
 
06:33:14.430 --> 06:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
point let let's go to the vote on the
 
06:33:17.190 --> 06:33:17.200 align:start position:0%

06:34:22.350 --> 06:34:22.360 align:start position:0%
um for the um change that mine made all
 
06:34:26.270 --> 06:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
it did was add the two lines on line 29
 
06:34:29.910 --> 06:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
and line 30 uh which say paragraph one
 
06:34:32.350 --> 06:34:32.360 align:start position:0%
of the section shall not apply to a
 
06:34:35.388 --> 06:34:35.398 align:start position:0%
procedure undertaken to Freedom minor oh
 
06:34:37.750 --> 06:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry no I've got that wrong uh I
 
06:34:42.270 --> 06:34:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:46.230 --> 06:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
there uh yes I'm sorry it's on the back
 
06:34:49.388 --> 06:34:49.398 align:start position:0%
page two did did did
 
06:34:52.548 --> 06:34:52.558 align:start position:0%
you your motion was not seconded was it
 
06:34:53.468 --> 06:34:53.478 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
06:34:56.388 --> 06:34:56.398 align:start position:0%
believe representative wood seconds
 
06:34:57.468 --> 06:34:57.478 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
06:34:59.670 --> 06:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
clerk thank you uh proceed
 
06:35:01.590 --> 06:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative sorry sorry for the
 
06:35:04.270 --> 06:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
interruption it's well I'm sorry for
 
06:35:06.270 --> 06:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
addressing the wrong section and putting
 
06:35:09.270 --> 06:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
you in the wrong space uh on page two
 
06:35:12.190 --> 06:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
lines 1 two and three simply allow
 
06:35:14.910 --> 06:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
patients under 18 years of age may
 
06:35:16.708 --> 06:35:16.718 align:start position:0%
continue to be treated with a
 
06:35:18.468 --> 06:35:18.478 align:start position:0%
prescription consistent with those
 
06:35:21.110 --> 06:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
referenced under this section if such
 
06:35:24.070 --> 06:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
treatment was commen commenced before
 
06:35:26.350 --> 06:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
and is still active on the effective
 
06:35:29.948 --> 06:35:29.958 align:start position:0%
date of this act for some minors who
 
06:35:32.510 --> 06:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
have been treated for a significant
 
06:35:34.190 --> 06:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
amount of time
 
06:35:36.548 --> 06:35:36.558 align:start position:0%
the discontinuation of treatment is
 
06:35:39.788 --> 06:35:39.798 align:start position:0%
going to be very harmful so uh this is
 
06:35:42.070 --> 06:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
basically a grandfather clause that lets
 
06:35:45.070 --> 06:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
those who have started continue uh even
 
06:35:48.030 --> 06:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
though we don't allow others to
 
06:35:51.590 --> 06:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
begin okay representative Woods um I
 
06:35:53.150 --> 06:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
would just support that because
 
06:35:55.590 --> 06:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
basically under AMA guidelines
 
06:35:58.388 --> 06:35:58.398 align:start position:0%
Physicians who undertake treatment of an
 
06:36:00.708 --> 06:36:00.718 align:start position:0%
individual have to follow certain
 
06:36:04.230 --> 06:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
guidelines and um that includes um
 
06:36:05.510 --> 06:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
an adequate
 
06:36:09.670 --> 06:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
consent that would include this kind of
 
06:36:12.510 --> 06:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
treatment were we to legislate that that
 
06:36:14.548 --> 06:36:14.558 align:start position:0%
would in fact be the practice of
 
06:36:16.430 --> 06:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
medicine to say all right doctor you
 
06:36:17.310 --> 06:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
have to
 
06:36:20.548 --> 06:36:20.558 align:start position:0%
stop that is indeed interfering with the
 
06:36:22.910 --> 06:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
doctor patient relationship going into
 
06:36:26.868 --> 06:36:26.878 align:start position:0%
the office and say sorry you're
 
06:36:30.430 --> 06:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:34.670 --> 06:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
malpractice um I I I think this is a
 
06:36:36.030 --> 06:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
very important
 
06:36:36.040 --> 06:36:37.590 align:start position:0%
very important
Clause

06:36:37.590 --> 06:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
Clause
 
06:36:40.910 --> 06:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
um and for the reasons I just mentioned
 
06:36:43.708 --> 06:36:43.718 align:start position:0%
thank you final comment representative
 
06:36:46.750 --> 06:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
pazo thank you Mr chair there are some
 
06:36:49.350 --> 06:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
interesting Arguments for this amendment
 
06:36:53.150 --> 06:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
but I feel uh it's a significant uh
 
06:36:56.590 --> 06:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
change that needs not just discussing
 
06:36:59.388 --> 06:36:59.398 align:start position:0%
but public hearing and maybe it can
 
06:37:01.948 --> 06:37:01.958 align:start position:0%
happen in Senate but right now I'm not
 
06:37:05.708 --> 06:37:05.718 align:start position:0%
comfortable with my knowledge adopting
 
06:37:08.388 --> 06:37:08.398 align:start position:0%
it okay the motion is out to pass on
 
06:37:11.788 --> 06:37:11.798 align:start position:0%
Amendment 0926 H Mr clerk if you're
 
06:37:15.468 --> 06:37:15.478 align:start position:0%
ready no I'm not ready all right
 
06:37:19.868 --> 06:37:19.878 align:start position:0%
representative mlan so I yeah I'm I I
 
06:37:23.230 --> 06:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
got to consider this because
 
06:37:27.350 --> 06:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh so I don't know that I adequately
 
06:37:29.270 --> 06:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
06:37:32.030 --> 06:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
consequences of stopping a treatment
 
06:37:32.040 --> 06:37:33.990 align:start position:0%
consequences of stopping a treatment
that's

06:37:33.990 --> 06:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's
 
06:37:36.868 --> 06:37:36.878 align:start position:0%
underway uh so if we pass both these
 
06:37:40.070 --> 06:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
bills both these Amendment what happens
 
06:37:42.150 --> 06:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
well representative wber explain that OS
 
06:37:44.670 --> 06:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
would reconcile them is that correct
 
06:37:46.350 --> 06:37:46.360 align:start position:0%
representative Weber that's my
 
06:37:47.910 --> 06:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
understanding my understanding is that
 
06:37:49.990 --> 06:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
they would take the two different
 
06:37:52.468 --> 06:37:52.478 align:start position:0%
Provisions they would probably be
 
06:37:54.990 --> 06:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
renumbered or put in a different order
 
06:37:58.670 --> 06:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
but the two sets of of uh mine is simply
 
06:38:01.110 --> 06:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
an addition onto whatever else is in the
 
06:38:03.510 --> 06:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
bill so it wouldn't interfere with any
 
06:38:06.270 --> 06:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
language that you've already approved in
 
06:38:08.430 --> 06:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
06:38:11.510 --> 06:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
masers they will take one uh make it
 
06:38:13.430 --> 06:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
into one committee
 
06:38:15.270 --> 06:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment sometimes there's a problem
 
06:38:17.030 --> 06:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
with getting the amendment at the last
 
06:38:19.070 --> 06:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
minute but representative haret you're
 
06:38:21.070 --> 06:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
about to leave right yeah we're not
 
06:38:22.670 --> 06:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
going to be able to finish this
 
06:38:25.670 --> 06:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
today well in deference to the the
 
06:38:27.830 --> 06:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
Democrats in the room representative
 
06:38:29.868 --> 06:38:29.878 align:start position:0%
hartnet needs to leave what procedurally
 
06:38:33.788 --> 06:38:33.798 align:start position:0%
what do we do can we continue this or
 
06:38:37.910 --> 06:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
you are the chairman yes no no but I but
 
06:38:41.468 --> 06:38:41.478 align:start position:0%
well we can we if we could just vote on
 
06:38:43.030 --> 06:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
this and vote on the bill and we'd be
 
06:38:45.670 --> 06:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
done so that would be
 
06:38:47.910 --> 06:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
quick we would have to
 
06:38:50.590 --> 06:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
caucus we don't have time to caucus then
 
06:38:52.788 --> 06:38:52.798 align:start position:0%
I would suggest we put this off until
 
06:38:55.388 --> 06:38:55.398 align:start position:0%
next week that you recess the executive
 
06:38:57.110 --> 06:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
session that you Reen notice it the fact
 
06:38:58.788 --> 06:38:58.798 align:start position:0%
that we're in the middle of a bill yeah
 
06:39:00.388 --> 06:39:00.398 align:start position:0%
that that was I was it was a procedural
 
06:39:01.990 --> 06:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
question not a political question right
 
06:39:04.468 --> 06:39:04.478 align:start position:0%
no I I I'm I'm trying to give you what I
 
06:39:07.150 --> 06:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
think is the procedural answer we are in
 
06:39:09.310 --> 06:39:09.320 align:start position:0%
the middle of a bill but I think that
 
06:39:11.388 --> 06:39:11.398 align:start position:0%
because it's an individual executive
 
06:39:13.150 --> 06:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
session you can
 
06:39:16.070 --> 06:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
recess I mean representative uh hartnet
 
06:39:18.110 --> 06:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
was you know a very forthcoming first
 
06:39:19.708 --> 06:39:19.718 align:start position:0%
thing this morning that he had to leave
 
06:39:21.788 --> 06:39:21.798 align:start position:0%
and personally I think it would be
 
06:39:24.948 --> 06:39:24.958 align:start position:0%
inequitable for us to proceed if if and
 
06:39:27.468 --> 06:39:27.478 align:start position:0%
I think that's very kind and I think the
 
06:39:31.868 --> 06:39:31.878 align:start position:0%
but I think you can simply recess now
 
06:39:36.430 --> 06:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
and Rec convene the executive session
 
06:39:38.430 --> 06:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
when you notice all of the bills next
 
06:39:42.750 --> 06:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
week okay yeah that does that make sense
 
06:39:45.350 --> 06:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
every represent to Pro you would you
 
06:39:47.510 --> 06:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
would represent uh you would recess to a
 
06:39:47.520 --> 06:39:48.388 align:start position:0%
would represent uh you would recess to a
Time

06:39:48.388 --> 06:39:48.398 align:start position:0%
Time
 
06:39:50.788 --> 06:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
certain well we we'll be reconvening at
 
06:39:53.270 --> 06:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
9:30 next Wednesday morning yes
 
06:39:56.270 --> 06:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
exactly what you said at which time we
 
06:39:58.830 --> 06:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
will consider this and all the other
 
06:40:00.868 --> 06:40:00.878 align:start position:0%

06:40:02.830 --> 06:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
