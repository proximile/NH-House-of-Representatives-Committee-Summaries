on over the weekend

committee members i believe all of you
 
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 align:start position:0%

acknowledged receipt of this it's a word
 
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
document that
 
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh i uh i labeled as division three
 
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
march madness
 
00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
remembering back in the day when there
 
00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 align:start position:0%
would actually be basketball tournaments
 
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
with people at them
 
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
um but so so our march madness
 
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
is the sprint to completing our budget
 
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
work on the 24th
 
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's in the calendar format that i
 
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
adopted from what
 
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
mr ripple gave us a while ago
 
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
and if you could if you could pop it
 
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.710 align:start position:0%
and if you could if you could pop it
open

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just walk you through it
 
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
um so for example you'll see that
 
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
today we have scheduled
 
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
the the close out of the public health
 
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
services and then we'll hear about the
 
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
veterans home
 
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
and this afternoon or this morning later
 
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
i'd like to get us to talk about section
 
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
22 of the hb2
 
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
see if that's ready to approve then
 
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
we'll have
 
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative wallner who has put in a
 
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
lot of extra
 
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
work uh over the past several days
 
00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 align:start position:0%

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 align:start position:0%

representative walner will you be ready
 
00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
to do that today ma'am i don't want to
 
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
put you on the spot
 
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
i think so i'm just going to ask um i
 
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
will send kevin an email i just
 
00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
i just had a couple of things that i
 
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
would ask kevin maybe to put up as a
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
screen share
 
00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am and then you'll you'll note if
 
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the march madness
 
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
calendar i sent out
 
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
that that i put on thursday of this week
 
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
that we would
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
we would finish section 39 so
 
00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 align:start position:0%
so you're we're not in under any
 
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
pressure today
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
to decide it's just great thank you
 
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
you're telling us what you got and then
 
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
we'll decide on thursday
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
okay fine uh
 
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
then um i'd like to get some input
 
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
on how we can do a quick sort on
 
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
um getting uh past the portions
 
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
of the budget that that we have you know
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
basically violent agreement about
 
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
and uh so that we can set it aside
 
00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
um and then mr ripple and mr felstad
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
you know as i understand uh there is a
 
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of work every time we
 
00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 align:start position:0%
change a number anywhere in the
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
accounting system
 
00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 align:start position:0%
it has to manually be gone and over and
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
typed into the system
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
and obviously that's prone to error
 
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.110 align:start position:0%
and obviously that's prone to error
because

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
you have humans doing it so there's a
 
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
lot of time spent
 
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
making sure there's quality control too
 
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.990 align:start position:0%
making sure there's quality control too
so

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
we we want to we want to give them as
 
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.270 align:start position:0%
we we want to we want to give them as
much

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
clerk entry work as early as possible so
 
00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:35.590 align:start position:0%
clerk entry work as early as possible so
that

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
they can move beyond it now uh represent
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
our representative mr ripple i just
 
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
described your process did i describe it
 
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.710 align:start position:0%
described your process did i describe it
semi-accurately

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
semi-accurately
 
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
what would you add so that we know
 
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
how how onerous a task that is i do
 
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
think you described it very accurately
 
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
so basically any change that you make we
 
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.189 align:start position:0%
so basically any change that you make we
will

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
need to go in and manually enter on both
 
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
the expenditure side and the funding
 
00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:01.990 align:start position:0%
the expenditure side and the funding
side

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
so if an item is funded by a mixture of
 
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
general funds federal funds and other
 
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.629 align:start position:0%
general funds federal funds and other
funds

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
we need to manually manually enter in
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
each one of those
 
00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 align:start position:0%
so it is quite a long process and you're
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
right at the end of it invariably there
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
will be mistakes i don't think i've ever
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
done it without mistakes and we'll have
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
to hunt those down and make any
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
necessary changes so
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
depending on how many changes the
 
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
committee decides to make
 
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
potentially take a couple of days okay
 
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
so so the my point in teeing that up is
 
00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
just to encourage all of us to be
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
what portions of the budget that we
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
think will be relatively easy for us to
 
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
agree to agree on and move past
 
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
so representative norgren uh you have
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
your hand up
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair um i think you
 
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
gave us homework
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
last week or the week before uh you gave
 
00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
us a list of possible
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
departments that you thought we could
 
00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:02.150 align:start position:0%
departments that you thought we could
just

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
okay without going any more into depth
 
00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 align:start position:0%
with them
 
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
and so division three uh
 
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
kathy rogers and mary jane waller and i
 
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.629 align:start position:0%
kathy rogers and mary jane waller and i
met

00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
met
 
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
and came up with their list so just so
 
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
you know when it's time
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
we're ready to talk to you about that oh
 
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
that's outstanding
 
00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
um if you if you've got that why don't
 
00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:23.589 align:start position:0%
um if you if you've got that why don't
you

00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
consider emailing it to all of us and
 
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:26.869 align:start position:0%
consider emailing it to all of us and
then

00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
if there's time this afternoon we'll uh
 
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
don't don't let me quit
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
the adjourn the meeting until we've
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
talked about what you've emailed
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
okay good thank you thank you
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
and then at the end of the day um
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
i see us doing uh our first
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
reveal of uh hb1
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
kind of an intro representative
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
irf and i have spent hours and hours
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
talking back and forth with each other
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
accessing these rounds integrating
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the finance committee uh
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're
 
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
in sync and so i think we have something
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
for mr or representative earth to share
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
with the committee
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
that will begin be the starting point
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
of our conversation with each other
 
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
about how
 
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
to invest some excess
 
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
revenues that uh fall out from the
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
process he used and i don't wanna
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
i don't wanna short change his
 
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.190 align:start position:0%
i don't wanna short change his
presentation

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
but i guess right up front with everyone
 
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
in the crowd
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
and everyone on the on on our committee
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
i i want you to just have it clear
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
that what representative irf will share
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
with us later
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
is a conversation starting point
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
it is not the end point of the division
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
three work
 
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
the end point of the division three work
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
will come as we approach the 24th of
 
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.630 align:start position:0%
will come as we approach the 24th of
march

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
march
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
and it'll be done with us talking to one
 
00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:09.990 align:start position:0%
and it'll be done with us talking to one
another

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
and agreeing on what we can agree on
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
and and just adding clarity if we
 
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
disagree on something
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
so so that we know what those issues are
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
but so don't
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
when you take a look at it please don't
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
react to it
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
until after representative has had a
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
chance to talk about it
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
and then so if there are no questions at
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
this point i think we're ready to start
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
the public health services
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
continuation does anyone have any
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
questions on the committee
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing any uh mr ripple
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
why don't you get us going where we
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
where we're supposed to be in the brief
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
okay um i'll actually i'll let karen
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
point you to where you're supposed to be
 
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
i think you're at the uh
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
you're into the budget now so you're
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
into the uh actual accounting units
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
and i think everybody's should be good
 
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
to go
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
okay great sorry i couldn't find the
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
file at first
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
um so where we left off uh was
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 5608 which is on page 10
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:26.839 --> 00:11:28.550 align:start position:0%
 
cessation

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
cessation
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
so i got to remember how to read these
 
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
again so okay
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
so so we is this one that requires a
 
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:35.750 align:start position:0%
so so we is this one that requires a
match

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
match
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
because we've got like 369 000 to the
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
bet 838 is there a match in here
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
early yes there is a match general fun
 
00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:49.509 align:start position:0%
early yes there is a match general fun
match

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
i'm having a hard time hearing is that
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
yes or no on a match
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
the match is typically uh 200 000
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
just a flat flat match
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
moe i forget what moe stands for but
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a minimal level of effort
 
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
that we're supposed to do we put 200 000
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
in and that makes us eligible for the
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
rest of it
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
so it's a 200k moe okay
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
yeah um you you've mentioned earlier in
 
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:53.750 align:start position:0%
yeah um you you've mentioned earlier in
your

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
narrative about the smoking cessation
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
program that it had worked very well and
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
you'd found good results on it
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
but i noticed that the funding is down
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
if it's working so well why are you
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
actually it looks like the general funds
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
are down slightly
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
so i don't want to interrupt but i'm
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
confused it looks like the general funds
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
are going from 340 to 369. so the
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
general funds are up a little bit
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's the federal funds that are down
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
the federal funds were budgeted um sorry
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
for the delay
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
and hopefully you can hear me my
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
internet telling me it's unstable
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
the federal funds are budgeted at the
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
level that we're being advised to budget
 
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:49.350 align:start position:0%
level that we're being advised to budget
by

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
the um for fiscal 20 and 21
 
00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
we had some carry forward funds that we
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
were able to bring
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
like one year we didn't spend it on we
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
requested to bring the federal funds
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
forward so
 
00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:07.519 align:start position:0%
the amounts for those two years have a
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
if you have a follow-up representative
 
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.269 align:start position:0%
if you have a follow-up representative
rogers

00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
rogers
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
you said you didn't spend it all why
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
i'd have to defer to um dr shirella if
 
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
she might have the answer
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise we could go back to the
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
program and check with them
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of times it's we can't get
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
contracts set up or
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
or stood up um timely for whatever the
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
reason may be
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
or if there's a vacancy in the positions
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
i'd i'd like you to get to us why that
 
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
money wasn't spent um
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
this is the second program that we found
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
that money we authorized wasn't spent
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm curious because it is a problem
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
is a deadly problem and you've shown
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
that the program works so i'm
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit leery if we're not using
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
all the money i'd like to know why so
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
could you get that information to the
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
division please
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
i think i can answer that question uh
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative rogers
 
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
um it's specifically related to a
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
contracting process
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
there was a delay in the contracting
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
process and that kind of added the
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
delays into spending down that funds
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
and what was the delay uh we
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
we actually had an rfp out and
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
the bidding process and plan getting
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
through the gnc process so that that was
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
the added
 
00:15:30.959 --> 00:15:34.389 align:start position:0%
the added
feeling

00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
so the delay was just what we didn't
 
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
have staff enough to do it we didn't
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
have time
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's that the process of getting the
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
bits in and reviewing and getting
 
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:50.870 align:start position:0%
bits in and reviewing and getting
through

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
some of the back and forth on the
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
financial process you know
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
the the finalizing the budgets and
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
everything so that added the delay
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
um uh this is lisa morris good morning
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
everybody i uh
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
maybe karen would have more information
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
but i know there um
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
that uh the covid contracts were taking
 
00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:08.949 align:start position:0%
that uh the covid contracts were taking
up

00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh quite a bit of time on the uh on the
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
contract unit side
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
uh and that may have contributed to
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
delays but i
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh karen you would know more information
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
i think that's accurate lisa so this
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been done before i mean
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
this budget passed before
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
the cove virus was active so i'm just
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
curious because we
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
seem to be finding more and more of this
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
that we authorize things not just in
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
this department
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
but otherwise things and they're not
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
done so that's why i'm curious
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
are there other questions here i i i
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
know that it's been described that this
 
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.230 align:start position:0%
know that it's been described that this
program

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
is effective but i don't know how you
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
would measure effectiveness
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
beyond the number of people reached or
 
00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.030 align:start position:0%
beyond the number of people reached or
touched

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
touched
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the number of people that
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
decided not to smoke i don't know how
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
you would measure that
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
so if um but uh
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
let's let's uh let's go ahead and go to
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
the next
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
um represent representative edwards uh
 
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
if it's if it's okay i know that dr
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
ella can answer that question if you
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
have the time but
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
i did want to mention that uh there was
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
uh 440 000 over the biennium
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
um of 2223 uh that was uh
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
identified as a prioritized need
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
our e-cigarette uh concerns
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh the number of adolescents who are
 
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
utilizing e-cigarettes electronic
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
cigarettes um so that is not reflected
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
here but wanted you to know that
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
where would that be reflected ms morris
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
it is not refl it is reflected i believe
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
yes it prioritized need in the agency
 
00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.669 align:start position:0%
yes it prioritized need in the agency
budget

00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
so which agency what line item what
 
00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.110 align:start position:0%
so which agency what line item what
number

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
no meaning our agency submission budget
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
that we made on
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
september okay so
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
you you ask the governor to consider it
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
and it didn't make it into his budget
 
00:18:15.919 --> 00:18:19.669 align:start position:0%
and it didn't make it into his budget
correct

00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
i had a good weekend i have to
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
re-remember how we say these things
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
understood so representative wallner
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
your hand is up
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you would that be um would
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
would there be federal money
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
for that or do is it 100
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
um general funds well those dollars that
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
i mentioned were
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
a general fund request okay
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
okay so are you able to with these
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
decide if you want to focus on
 
00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:56.950 align:start position:0%
decide if you want to focus on
prevention

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
of traditional cigarettes or
 
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.390 align:start position:0%
of traditional cigarettes or
e-cigarettes

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
e-cigarettes
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
or when you get the general funds is it
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
segregated and restricting you to only
 
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
traditional cigarettes
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
dr tarella can you uh can you repeat the
 
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.230 align:start position:0%
dr tarella can you uh can you repeat the
question

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
representative edwards i didn't hear
 
00:19:15.919 --> 00:19:18.230 align:start position:0%
representative edwards i didn't hear
that

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
i want to know if you have any
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
restrictions on these general funds to
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
where if we give you general funds
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
if you must use them on traditional
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
cigarettes or do you
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
inherently have the flexibility
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
of spending it on e-cigarette
 
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
prevention efforts when we requested it
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
was specifically for the e-cigarette
 
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.070 align:start position:0%
was specifically for the e-cigarette
prevention

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
the priority request that we made the
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
the to the 440 that miss
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
dr morris has mentioned it's basically
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
meant for the youth prevention
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
for the e-cigarettes yes but we do not
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
have restriction
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
on the use of general funds uh but we
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
use those general funds
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
for uh for uh for both
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
traditional tobacco and e-cigarettes
 
00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
okay so so you have inherent flexibility
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
in this even though that
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
there's a 200 000 moe against the
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
federal money
 
00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
even that 200 000 is flexible
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
is that true it's it's specifically
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
macro prevention
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
activities yes okay
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
uh representative wallner you have a
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay your hand is down i think we can
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
move on
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
the next one is account 5659 which is
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
this is a relatively small amount of
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
in a relatively large amount of federal
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
funds is that
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
170 a required match or an moe
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
it is a required match stated
 
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
okay i'm using the words differently uh
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
just so you're track we're tracking on
 
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.470 align:start position:0%
just so you're track we're tracking on
communication

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
communication
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
if it's an moe i think we have to
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
we have to spend that money before we
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
get the first nickel of federal money
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
that's distinct from a match in my view
 
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
a match in my view has a
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
ratio correlated with it so that if we
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
give two dollars we're eligible for four
 
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.110 align:start position:0%
give two dollars we're eligible for four
dollars

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
so so this 170 is that an moe
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
it's called a match in the notice of
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
but it is more similar to what we would
 
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
define in moe
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
it sometimes the federal government
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
likes to call it something different
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna consider
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
that 170 in moe
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
am i wrong that's fine
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
the next one is 70 45 which is wise
 
00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:41.830 align:start position:0%
the next one is 70 45 which is wise
women

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
women
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
this is a grant that started this year
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
we submitted an item to fiscal committee
 
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh very recently so that's why it's not
 
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
showing anything an adjusted authorized
 
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.310 align:start position:0%
showing anything an adjusted authorized
there

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
okay so this is just federal money
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
welcome representative weiler
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
um we're we're in progress we've talked
 
00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.470 align:start position:0%
um we're we're in progress we've talked
about

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
just two accounts so far you haven't you
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
haven't missed much discussion on the
 
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.669 align:start position:0%
haven't missed much discussion on the
accounting

00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
accounting
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
okay so this is all this is all federal
 
00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:11.750 align:start position:0%
okay so this is all this is all federal
money

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
so this is this is a comment i would
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
make to the committee
 
00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:18.799 align:start position:0%
um and that is as as
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
earlier when i was talking about uh
 
00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for us to agree on
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
things that we could remove
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
from future considerations so that the
 
00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:29.350 align:start position:0%
from future considerations so that the
rep

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
rep
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
mr ripple and feldstein still can
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
put it to bed and not worry about it
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
these programs
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
where it's all federal money i i would
 
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
tend to put into that
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
bucket of we don't need to consider it
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
further for division three
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
and so this would be a good example of
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
of of that rule of thumb if it's all
 
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.470 align:start position:0%
of of that rule of thumb if it's all
federal

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
let's let's just accept it and move on
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm taking a little diversion but is
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
there any discussion to that or is there
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
any disagreement with that point of view
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
from the committee it's the way we've
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
usually dealt
 
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
okay representative rogers your hand is
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
up well i have a problem in the um
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
the funds for the tobacco prevention and
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
cessation that the governor um
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
can we can we pause that conversation
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
and finish this one right now which is
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
i thought you were talking about both of
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
those funds i'm sorry
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
i'm only talking about wise women as an
 
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.549 align:start position:0%
i'm only talking about wise women as an
example

00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
of an account that only has federal
 
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:35.990 align:start position:0%
of an account that only has federal
money

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
okay sure we can
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
reserve that then i just meant i thought
 
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
you were talking about all of them
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
no just the ones that only have federal
 
00:24:46.159 --> 00:24:46.870 align:start position:0%
no just the ones that only have federal
money

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
okay okay now you
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
you still have a comment on tobacco
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
cessation so we can go back to that if
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
you'd like
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
no i can wait until we i thought you
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
wanted us to approve that one
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
now oh no okay come on then
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
okay um so we were uh
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
at wise woman i i think i think we can
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
go on unless there are any questions
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.710 align:start position:0%
 
arthritis

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
arthritis
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
can we just look at the funding line for
 
00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
a quick moment
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
are there any are there any questions on
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
this um this
 
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not seeing any we can go on
 
00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.149 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not seeing any we can go on
okay

00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
the next accounting unit is 70 47 which
 
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
is community collaboration
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
is this where the prioritized needs are
 
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
lisa yes i'm here on the same side
 
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
not in her head so there are several
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs with this accounting
 
00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.029 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs with this accounting
unit

00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
all um what has been referred to
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh in the last legislative session and
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
publicly is parental assistance dollars
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
um they are preventative dollars for
 
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
our families can we
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
can we go to the funding line just so we
 
00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:31.669 align:start position:0%
can we go to the funding line just so we
have

00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
context so so
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
am i reading this right that this
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
community collaboration is 100
 
00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:42.490 align:start position:0%
federal funding that's correct um
 
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:43.750 align:start position:0%
federal funding that's correct um
[Music]

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
the prioritized needs are 100 general
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
funds though
 
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
what what are your prioritized needs how
 
00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.430 align:start position:0%
what what are your prioritized needs how
much

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
i believe it was around 1.2 million
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
for this particular so you want 1.2
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
million for community collaboration in
 
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:05.919 align:start position:0%
yes over the biennium so six hundred
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
thousand each year
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
this was in the list that the governor
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
um sent over as well
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
that he did what too i'm you faded just
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
a little bit and i'm feeling deaf today
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
um it was in the list that the governor
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
sent over in the letter to the house
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
and that you're referring to the letter
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
where he said hey
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
it's okay if you spend more money in
 
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
that that was just
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
it was the letter that the governor sent
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
to the house
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
okay so are there any other questions
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
what would what would you do with 600
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
000 more a year how many personnel would
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
you hire and what would they be doing
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh dr tirella would you like to take
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
that question
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh we are not hiring people the funding
 
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
is going towards
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
three of our contracts specifically
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
collaborations and uh the all the
 
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
going to the communities nothing is
 
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
staying with us and the funding is
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
specifically for the three
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
agencies that are focused on the
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
community collaborations
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
and one other uh funding is also going
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
to family connections it's the
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
through the department connection the
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
funding will be going to them
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
to support like the for specifically for
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
families uh to provide parental
 
00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:32.070 align:start position:0%
families uh to provide parental
education

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh and um for who are the
 
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
family connections one is specifically
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
with the financial education
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
and programs for resident consumption
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
state prison
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
the other the other amount which i
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
talked about community collaboration is
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
very much focused on our funding that's
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
coming through federal funds
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
so those will be going to the three
 
00:28:51.039 --> 00:28:52.870 align:start position:0%
so those will be going to the three
communities

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
side can you uh talk about what exactly
 
00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
they'll be doing with those dollars
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
you know um i i can provide some details
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh these are these grants are very much
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
this funding is very much focused on
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
families with children with uh
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
children with zero to eight so we're
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
looking at how to create communities and
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
connections for those families with
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
um to reduce the barrier to access so
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
connecting them all the resources that
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
the families can access to
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
so these could be parent education
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
classes crisis support
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
warm handouts to child care or mental
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
health or substance use
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
or dental health or even economic
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
support for those families
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
so that's what the focus is on
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
so flipping it around if i'm ahead of a
 
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.230 align:start position:0%
so flipping it around if i'm ahead of a
household

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
household
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
the impact that these dollars would have
 
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
is that the people in
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
dhhs and in other community
 
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.710 align:start position:0%
dhhs and in other community
organizations

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
would be better resourced in order to
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
make me aware
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
of the services that are available and
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
help coach me on which services i should
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
apply for
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
yes it would also help connect you to
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
those services and the
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
goal is to reduce the rates of child
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
maltreatment so we're talking about
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
families in need
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
and if i can just jump in um if you
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
recall back to last week when we were
 
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:11.990 align:start position:0%
recall back to last week when we were
talking

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
this is a better connection to some of
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
those home visiting programs i was
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
and in particular we had a really
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
successful pilot program
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
for substance exposed infants so again
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
getting those families early on
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
um connecting with prenatal providers
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
making sure
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
from the moment that baby is born that
 
00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:31.039 align:start position:0%
they're connected to the resources they
 
00:30:31.039 --> 00:30:31.510 align:start position:0%
they're connected to the resources they
need

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
and the parents have the support they
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
need for appropriate parenting
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
understanding child development and in
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
particular with those substance exposed
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
okay for one i had children
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
that seemed like a lot of that sort of
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
communication and coordination would
 
00:30:51.919 --> 00:30:52.789 align:start position:0%
communication and coordination would
come

00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
from the office of the ob gyn that would
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
have follow-up visits with us to check
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
on well baby status
 
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
what why is that not adequate
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
these days trisha do you want to take
 
00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:07.669 align:start position:0%
these days trisha do you want to take
that

00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
sure so what we're finding is actually
 
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
that those medical providers
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
are coming and really depending on our
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
family resource centers in particular
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
um in our communities to do that sort of
 
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
dated um week to week home visiting
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
supportive help that they don't have
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
time for within the context of those
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
well baby visits
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
those well baby visits may happen in the
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
early days you know once a month and
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
in these programs what we find is that
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
we have some evidence-based programs
 
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
um that have home visits that start
 
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
weekly and we can connect them to the
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
resources that's needed
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
provide the modeling and support around
 
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate parenting again if you think
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
about those substance exposed infants
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
those babies
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
come out and they may have some
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
additional needs making sure they're
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
connected with early supports and
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
services if if that's required if
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
there's an actual
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
developmental issue going on and really
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
making sure those families are connected
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
to their communities
 
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
so the doctors have asked us to work
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
hand in hand with them
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
to make sure that those families are
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
supported really so that
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
we prevent child maltreatment and the
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
negative health outcomes that we want
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
you know again if you recall when we
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
were talking about home visiting
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes many times we start
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
prenatally and we're even looking
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
at um the birth outcomes there ensuring
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
that folks
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
stick with their tobacco cessation we
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
know many families have a number of
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
of things that they're stressed over and
 
00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
tobacco is one of them
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
and we were just talking about the
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
tobacco program and and we know that
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
pregnant women need
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of support to stay to stay quit
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
not only during pregnancy but even
 
00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.830 align:start position:0%
not only during pregnancy but even
postpartum

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
postpartum
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
and doctor tarella said that is 600 000
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
there were no additional personnel
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
that would be funded by that 600
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
thousand is that
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
is that accurate i know she's a
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
physician and not a resource manager
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
is that did she say she's both she's
 
00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.350 align:start position:0%
is that did she say she's both she's
both

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
um but that is correct it goes right out
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
to the communities
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
okay i are there any other questions in
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
okay the next one is uh 5896 which is
 
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
the home visiting grant this is also
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
an area where there is a prioritized
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
need of 464 thousand dollars a year
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
which was also on the list that the
 
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
governor provided to the house
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
per year so that's almost a million over
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
the biennium
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
yes 927 thousand
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
we look at peak ahead at what the
 
00:33:57.669 --> 00:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
breakdown between federal
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
or wherever i did yep it's 100 federal
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
yes you sort of go in and out when
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
you're when you're talking unless you're
 
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
okay i'm trying to i think my microphone
 
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:20.790 align:start position:0%
okay i'm trying to i think my microphone
is

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
forward halfway across my desk so i'll
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
try to lean forward
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
is that volume uh okay representative
 
00:34:35.839 --> 00:34:36.389 align:start position:0%
is that volume uh okay representative
erf

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
erf
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
yes that's good you can maintain that
 
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
i don't want to yell at people um all
 
00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:42.869 align:start position:0%
i don't want to yell at people um all
right

00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
so we can continue all right the next
 
00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:46.069 align:start position:0%
so we can continue all right the next
one

00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
is 5906 which is suid
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
you have any prioritized needs in this
 
00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:00.829 align:start position:0%
you have any prioritized needs in this
account

00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
nope i think we've talked about all of
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
the public health prioritized themes at
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
this point if i remember correctly
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
maybe one more yeah i think there's one
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
more in the laboratory
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
oh i need a web that's right are there
 
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
any questions on the
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
remind me of the acronym s-u-i-d
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
i can't even imagine being a parent and
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
having that happen
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
can i ask a question about that sure
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
this isn't budget specific but
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
um so i've experienced this
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is that a long time
 
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
ago back in the 90s
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
that you no longer provide things like
 
00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:56.870 align:start position:0%
that you no longer provide things like
the

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
report to the parents is that true
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh i i can check on that but we do talk
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
with the parents our office of chief
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
medical examiner reaches out
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
provides them all their grief resources
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
that that's what we do but i can check
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
on whether that information about
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
autopsy is limited now or not
 
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
i missed that word when you said you
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
reached out to them to discuss what
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
grief resources the resources for us to
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
support them
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
during that grief time like it could be
 
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:30.870 align:start position:0%
during that grief time like it could be
um

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
okay okay i understand the grief
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
resources um i'm asking more about the
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
the actual cause of death resources as
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to that
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
we joined the sids uh group at the time
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
which i hope is still active
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
and it was a big help no doubt about it
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
but i'm curious also about the um
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
the cause of death reports we can follow
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
up on that one uh most of that
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
information goes from our office of
 
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
chief medical examiner
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
office and i can check on that thank you
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative earth we're so sorry for
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
your loss
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
well thank you i appreciate that well
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
there wasn't trying to draw sympathy
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
okay all right so i think we're on
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
6048 wic infrastructure that's correct
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
and then uh what are the general funds
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
requests there
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
are there any questions here by the
 
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.230 align:start position:0%
are there any questions here by the
committee

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
saying none let's let's go to the next
 
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
okay the next one is 1227 which is
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
combined chronic disease
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
all right yeah just a quick question
 
00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:57.510 align:start position:0%
all right yeah just a quick question
sorry

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
i noticed some of these accounts karen
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
that are just 100 federal still have a
 
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
general line whereas others don't is
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
that because of
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
points in time they've had general
 
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
funding that's possible
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
okay um yes that would be my guess that
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
either in
 
00:38:13.349 --> 00:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
20 or 21 there were some general funds
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
there sometimes inappropriately
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
or incorrectly i should say maybe you
 
00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:23.670 align:start position:0%
or incorrectly i should say maybe you
know

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
okay the next one is 1228 which is the
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
this one is is entirely or pretty
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's all general funds or
 
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
there's some transfer from other
 
00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.030 align:start position:0%
there's some transfer from other
agencies

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
okay and then this is
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
it's it's a flat funded from the prior
 
00:38:59.599 --> 00:39:03.750 align:start position:0%
it's it's a flat funded from the prior
year

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
was that is that intentional what's
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
in this area or we
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
are we serving the same number of people
 
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
or the call volumes going up or we
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
is how are things going here
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh go ahead
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
go ahead uh yes the call volumes have
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
been going up during the covert time
 
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
specifically um uh there was a 24
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
increase from 2019 and largely due to
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic about cleaning and all other
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
questions um in 2020 we had around nine
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
at close to 9 300 human exposure so
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
different kind of substances
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
so that's that's what we they have done
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
and a lot of prevention resources during
 
00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
pandemic time so
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
related to poisonings has the labs fact
 
00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
sheets about
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
what's what's the right way of cleaning
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
and all other things
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
yes there has been increased but we have
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren question yes
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
um do we still service
 
00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
maine with our poison control center
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
i believe we used to it's a northern new
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
england poison center but it it doesn't
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
yes it's based in maine
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh uh but it serves new hampshire
 
00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.510 align:start position:0%
uh uh but it serves new hampshire
specifically

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for pointing that out uh
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
representative nordron
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
um all right uh i don't see any other
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
the next one is 1869 which is uh
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
oh do you want to explain what that is
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
that is too many acronyms for me
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
that's fine i can tell uh it's called
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
national uh national violent death
 
00:41:02.079 --> 00:41:11.670 align:start position:0%
national uh national violent death
registry

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
we can move on how are we doing uh
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
ms rounds are are we are we uh
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
we've got an hour or so or longer what
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
do you think to get through public
 
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.109 align:start position:0%
do you think to get through public
health

00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
um it's probably about another hour we
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
were a little bit slow starting off but
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
i think we're moving along now so
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
um 33 86 early hearing
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
i knew detention didn't make sense there
 
00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:54.309 align:start position:0%
i knew detention didn't make sense there
so

00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
okay this is all federal funds it is
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
who are we testing with that are we
 
00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.349 align:start position:0%
who are we testing with that are we
testing

00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
testing
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
only children who show special
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
characteristics or are we doing 100
 
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
well baby what what who's the target
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
population it's universal screening so
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
we do screen for all the kids
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
all the babies born in new hampshire and
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
then based on their need then we follow
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
up on their
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh if they have uh some hearing uh
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
deficiency then we follow up on their
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
families and connect them as well as to
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
the providers and others
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
assume the follow-up is coming from a
 
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
different budget though
 
00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
yes there are two newborn hearing
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
3387 newborn hearing well how many
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
how many how many babies get tested for
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
in that federal program per year i i
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
heard you say all of them but what is
 
00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:58.630 align:start position:0%
heard you say all of them but what is
that

00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it's around we have
 
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
around 12 000 births happening in new
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire so basically we are looking at
 
00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
around 12 000 babies
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
for screening and then follow-up is
 
00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
around uh because the follow-up we do up
 
00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:12.870 align:start position:0%
around uh because the follow-up we do up
to

00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
age of three years so it's around 400
 
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
very good let's talk about 33.87
 
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
unless i don't see any questions this is
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
also 100
 
00:43:28.079 --> 00:43:35.670 align:start position:0%
also 100
federal

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
okay do we have any sense of how long
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
the federal government will
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
want to continue funding these two lines
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
is this is this something that we get an
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
early indicator
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
on whether or not they think this should
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
be transitioned to the state at some
 
00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:55.349 align:start position:0%
be transitioned to the state at some
point

00:43:55.349 --> 00:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
we haven't gotten anything from them yet
 
00:43:58.079 --> 00:43:58.710 align:start position:0%
we haven't gotten anything from them yet
i

00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen them changing uh any of
 
00:44:01.599 --> 00:44:02.069 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen them changing uh any of
their

00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
thought process on how this is funded at
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
this point of time
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
or how it should be funded in future
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.829 --> 00:44:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.839 --> 00:44:29.270 align:start position:0%
 
education

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
we're dropping the federal government
 
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
looks like they're
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
they they went up they spiked in 21 but
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh from 20 and that they're returning
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
to their previous levels why why did
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
they spike for a year
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
do we know um sometimes they have extra
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
funding so they provide
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
us uh saying like this is an extra
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
dollars or funding that's available can
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
for the states so that's how what
 
00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:57.589 align:start position:0%
for the states so that's how what
happened

00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
entwined in that 2021 timeline and now
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
we are back to our regular
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
our regular funding stream
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on this line
 
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.390 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on this line
item

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not seeing any so we can go
 
00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:16.829 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not seeing any so we can go
on

00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
3396s uh
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
wick implementation uh which is no
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
longer in use
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
so then moving down to 3397 is the
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
okay um i'm sorry you jumped right when
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
i was
 
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
okay so we've got on the cancer registry
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
um in 20 we had zero
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
general funds and we put 150
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
in and 21 and we're increasing that a
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
what what what's the story here why why
 
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
did we
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
get into this with general funds when
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead dr torella uh
 
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure why it is not reflecting
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
but we always had general funds in the
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
cancer registry because it's required
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
under the
 
00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:26.839 align:start position:0%
moa has an uh state fund match state
 
00:46:26.839 --> 00:46:28.390 align:start position:0%
moa has an uh state fund match state
match

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
match
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
and um not sure why we are seeing some
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
um the fiscal year 20 may have closed
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
incorrectly or it could be that the
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
general funds ended up being matched
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
by cost allocation but actually
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
i would have to double double check that
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
karen yes okay
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
so when you're double checking this
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
would you give us the exact
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
match percentage requirement
 
00:46:54.839 --> 00:46:58.710 align:start position:0%
match percentage requirement
absolutely

00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that um we might want to
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
call it an moe
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
chairman okay good if it's an moe i want
 
00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
to know versus the match
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
okay you got it
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
accepting my simple terminology
 
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
all right um we
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
can continue all right 50 40 is opioid
 
00:47:22.839 --> 00:47:24.150 align:start position:0%
can continue all right 50 40 is opioid
surveillance

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
surveillance
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
what are they doing they drop they drop
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
theirs a lot
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of drop in the federal funds
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
so are we seeing a decrease in the
 
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
federal prio
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
well that's hard to say because they
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
started at 324 in fy 20
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
and then multiply that by 10 times or
 
00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.390 align:start position:0%
and then multiply that by 10 times or
more

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
i think and chile correct me if i'm
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
wrong but i think there was unspent
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
grant in fiscal year 20
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
that may be being reflected in 21.
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
definitely we got
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
um our our first year award was uh
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
smaller um we got a a bigger award in
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
the middle of 20.
 
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
um we did go to fiscal committee and get
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
it budgeted but
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
we were working on standing up the
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
programs and the contracts so it didn't
 
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:24.950 align:start position:0%
programs and the contracts so it didn't
get

00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
expended all in 20. so 21 is
 
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
at the level that moving forward what
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
our award is
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
or yeah representative wallner you have
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
you're unmute sorry about that um i see
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
that the contracts are
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
about five about half a million dollars
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
less each year
 
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
what kinds of contracts are we not going
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
to be having
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
in 22 and 23. we
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
um i can answer that question um it's
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
not going to impact any of our current
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
contracts they will be
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
all level funded as you can see the 2021
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
is the time
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
when we had some extra dollars extra
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
funding that actually went into
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh the contracts but everyone is
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
funded and no changes on their contract
 
00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:27.109 align:start position:0%
funded and no changes on their contract
lines

00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
lines
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any more questions we can
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
go to
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
7048 i think is next
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
yes which is a pediatric
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
mental health access and this is 100
 
00:49:46.079 --> 00:49:49.190 align:start position:0%
mental health access and this is 100
federal

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
there any questions here
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any we can go
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay the next one is uh 1079 which is
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
pediatric cancer survey which was a
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
one-time expenditure in fiscal year 21.
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh then right after that is 34.87 which
 
00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:09.430 align:start position:0%
uh then right after that is 34.87 which
is

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh maternal mortality which is 100
 
00:50:13.119 --> 00:50:17.750 align:start position:0%
uh maternal mortality which is 100
percent

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
questions from maternal mortality
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
this is the death of the mother and
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
childbirth is that what that is
 
00:50:24.079 --> 00:50:25.190 align:start position:0%
childbirth is that what that is
generally

00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
generally
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
up to one year of uh after pregnancy or
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
after delivery how many of those do we
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
have a year
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
we um we are very lucky in our state our
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
numbers are very low
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
they are less than um they're very low
 
00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
compared to the rest of the country less
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
than 10
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
i mean if we're having 12 000 kids or
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
are we losing
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
less than 10 moms you think yes less
 
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
than 10 actually
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
the next one is chronic disease asthma
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any okay the next one
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
is 74-23 which is senior nutrition
 
00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:34.839 --> 00:51:42.710 align:start position:0%
 
federal

00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
so we're spending we're shifting we plan
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
to shift
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of the money to grants for public
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
assistance and relief
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
and away from contracts from for program
 
00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.510 align:start position:0%
and away from contracts from for program
services

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
so is this is this is an accounting
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
cleanup or a program change
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
yes this is the change that i've talked
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
about where we are moving it
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
uh to better track sub-recipient
 
00:52:06.559 --> 00:52:07.670 align:start position:0%
uh to better track sub-recipient
contracts

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%

okay uh so the first one in this bureau
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
is 2 2 2 2 which is the
 
00:52:58.829 --> 00:52:58.839 align:start position:0%
ryan white part b this is 100 federal
 
00:52:58.839 --> 00:53:00.309 align:start position:0%
ryan white part b this is 100 federal
funds

00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
it is yes so how are we doing with
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
hiv stats are they have they trended
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
down or are they
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
are we still experiencing hiv and
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
worrisome levels uh
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh dr daley is on on the zoom and she
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
can answer that question for you
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
great yes good morning everyone thank
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman for that question so
 
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
hiv we do continue to identify new
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
infections each year it's
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
actually become pretty stable and
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
plateaued here in new hampshire we have
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
between 25
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
and 50 new cases identified each year in
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
and in terms of people living with hiv
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
and aids it's about 1200 to 1300 people
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and those are the
 
00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
people that we're serving
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
through the different contracts that we
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
have in place so let's say
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
it's between you just said it he's just
 
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
said we have about 15 to 25 a year
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
what what is what's the primary disease
 
00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:07.750 align:start position:0%
what what is what's the primary disease
vector

00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
vector
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
is it is it still unprotected sex is it
 
00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.309 align:start position:0%
is it is it still unprotected sex is it
uh

00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
generational pass from mom to baby or
 
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
what what
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
what's the disease vector great question
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
so primarily who we are seeing
 
00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
become infected with hiv currently are
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
men who have sex with men so it's sexual
 
00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:27.910 align:start position:0%
men who have sex with men so it's sexual
transmission

00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
and then we also do have some
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
transmission occurring through
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
shared needles um for drug use and it's
 
00:54:34.319 --> 00:54:34.710 align:start position:0%
shared needles um for drug use and it's
very

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
uncommon actually to have the mom pass
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
to the baby although we do have
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know one case happen every few years
 
00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
where we've documented that occurring
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
and that's because
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
we try to get as many people who get
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with hiv on effective
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
treatment so that
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
kind of thing does not happen as long as
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
that mom's on her antiviral
 
00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
um therapy then there's it's unlikely
 
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
the baby will
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
will become infected well that's good
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
news so
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
so in this ryan fund is this
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh i i shouldn't be able to look at it
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
faster than i
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
am but is this um it says care
 
00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:11.829 align:start position:0%
am but is this um it says care
assistance

00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
so of the is this meant to go to the 15
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
to 25 to augment their health care
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
to deal specifically with their hiv
 
00:55:20.079 --> 00:55:21.829 align:start position:0%
to deal specifically with their hiv
problems

00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
yes and so it actually serves about 1200
 
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
to 1 300 people who are living with hiv
 
00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
and aids in new hampshire so that
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
25 to 50 are the number of new
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
infections that we add each year
 
00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
but there's it's obviously a lifelong
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
chronic condition now and so people will
 
00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:37.349 align:start position:0%
chronic condition now and so people will
live

00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
live
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
with it for their lifetime and will need
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
to continue to receive
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
that effective care to keep them alive
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
there's a number of different accounting
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
units here that are for different hiv
 
00:55:47.359 --> 00:55:47.990 align:start position:0%
units here that are for different hiv
services

00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:50.799 align:start position:0%
and this one does provide financial
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
assistance to people who need it for
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
they provide that care for them
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
financial assistance
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
in what type are we helping them pay
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
medical bills prescriptions are we
 
00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
helping them
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
with housing or something else what what
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
what kind of assistance are we giving
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
sure so we're a payer
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
of last resort so what we first try to
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
do is connect people
 
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
um to health insurance that they may
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
already be
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
eligible for we will connect them to
 
00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:21.270 align:start position:0%
eligible for we will connect them to
medicaid

00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
and we might help them pay their
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
premiums or co-pays if they can't afford
 
00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:26.470 align:start position:0%
premiums or co-pays if they can't afford
that

00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
and then we do pay for their
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
um their medical bills as well anything
 
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's outstanding
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
or if they're completely uninsured but
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
again we try to connect them to medicaid
 
00:56:38.559 --> 00:56:39.510 align:start position:0%
again we try to connect them to medicaid
first

00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
and so it provides that funding for
 
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:42.710 align:start position:0%
and so it provides that funding for
their

00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
their treatment and also some wraparound
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
services we have case managers who
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
assist these people with
 
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
getting access to different services in
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
the state it might include for example
 
00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.470 align:start position:0%
the state it might include for example
transportation

00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
to their um to their medical
 
00:56:57.839 --> 00:56:58.710 align:start position:0%
to their um to their medical
appointments

00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
appointments
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
there is housing money available for
 
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
people living with hiv
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
and aids but that's in a different
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
accounting unit and overseen by the
 
00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
bureau of housing
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
homelessness and housing at dhhs
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
so have we gotten a number of hiv
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
transmissions that are associated with
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
unprotected sex have we gotten that
 
00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
number down low enough to where
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
people know they shouldn't be having
 
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
unprotected sex they just
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
are doing it anyways or have we kind of
 
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:32.799 align:start position:0%
maxed out
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
the potential of prevention
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
um well i'd hate to say that we've maxed
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
out the potential of
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
prevention but we have plateaued right
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
so we continue to still see transmission
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
occurring i think a lot of people
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
obviously know about hiv and the risks
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
from risky behavior however there's
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
different barriers that come into play
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
that prevent people
 
00:57:56.549 --> 00:57:56.559 align:start position:0%
from being able to make good choices all
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
the time and so
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
we're actually there's new technologies
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
available new medications that have come
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
on the market where
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
people can actually take a medicine if
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
they every day if they want to prevent
 
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
i'm getting hiv if they are in a risky
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
group um so there's new
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
options for us to try and prevent hiv
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to think that we
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
we could not have any hiv too but
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
certainly it has plateaued and
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
yeah zero is the goal but yeah
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
all right uh are there any questions
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
other than mine in this area
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative norgren thank you mr
 
00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:30.630 align:start position:0%
uh representative norgren thank you mr
chair

00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
um i was just wanting to maybe suggest
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
obviously it's your decision mr chair
 
00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:37.349 align:start position:0%
obviously it's your decision mr chair
that

00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
we okay all these uh
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
departments or we just had federal
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
funding i think
 
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
we'd have a great feeling of
 
00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:47.750 align:start position:0%
we'd have a great feeling of
accomplishment

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
accomplishment
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
and it would make us our list longer
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
that we have to go back and look at
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
so i i agree with what your
 
00:58:59.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
intent is there the the process i was
 
00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:00.789 align:start position:0%
intent is there the the process i was
anticipating

00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:00.799 align:start position:0%
anticipating
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
is was just slightly different i i was
 
00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:04.390 align:start position:0%
is was just slightly different i i was
asking

00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
asking
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
i just this morning asked mr ripple to
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
create a list
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
of all of the accounts that are federal
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
funds only
 
00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
so that we once we got a documented list
 
00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
in front of us we could review it
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
overnight just to make sure we're
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
and that we would do one vote on all of
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
those uh but
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
but i i thought we may want to see
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
a list to help document exactly what
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
we're voting on
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a good plan thank you
 
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
so i think we're ready for 2223
 
00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:54.069 --> 00:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
which is also related to hiv and
 
00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
shelly where did these funds come from
 
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
good question
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
what what is a private local fund dr
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
daly would you like to address this
 
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
dart these are coming from um this
 
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
the boston public health they've
 
01:00:12.799 --> 01:00:13.750 align:start position:0%
the boston public health they've
received

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
received
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
funding for their ema their metropolitan
 
01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.069 align:start position:0%
funding for their ema their metropolitan
area

01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
and because new hampshire abuts that
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
region part of our new hampshire
 
01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
counties are
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
in their ema and they provide
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
us funding uh to help serve the
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
community that is part of their larger
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
region the boston region and so we are
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
able to use these
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
funds to serve people who are in
 
01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.349 align:start position:0%
funds to serve people who are in
hillsborough

01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
hillsborough
 
01:00:43.589 --> 01:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
brackingham and stratford counties
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
so that's all great i i just wonder as
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
tedious as miss rounds is if if this is
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
properly labeled it sounds like the
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
boston ema
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
may be getting federal money and then uh
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
sharing it with us
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
um and that would make that government
 
01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:02.309 align:start position:0%
um and that would make that government
funds

01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
not private or did i misunderstand
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
so that it would be federal to the city
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
of boston
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
and then it's private local funds to us
 
01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
so it's the city of boston's
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility to audit
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
us as their sub-recipient for these
 
01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.230 align:start position:0%
us as their sub-recipient for these
funds

01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government would audit the
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
city of boston
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
so we're considering the city of boston
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
a governmental
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
entity a private source of local funds
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
i don't see any other questions we could
 
01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:38.559 align:start position:0%
do 229
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
all federal right no agency a little bit
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
of agency income and
 
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
the general funds that are there in
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 um should not have been
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
the way i'm reading that that's a huge
 
01:02:00.079 --> 01:02:00.549 align:start position:0%
the way i'm reading that that's a huge
amount

01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:00.559 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
five million dollars on agency income
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
and very little federal oh yes i'm sorry
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
i read it backwards
 
01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
no i i said it wrong to begin with i
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
think i i
 
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
i started it wrong so
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
so as i understand this money
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
as well you tell me what this money is
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
where are these rebates coming from i
 
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:26.559 align:start position:0%
think they come from the pharmaceutical
 
01:02:26.559 --> 01:02:27.510 align:start position:0%
think they come from the pharmaceutical
companies

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:02:31.109 --> 01:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
but on what basis they do so uh recall
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
pay for people's hiv medications
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
and normally you know patients might get
 
01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
rebates back for you for purchasing
 
01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.069 align:start position:0%
rebates back for you for purchasing
those

01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
drugs but because we're the ones who are
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
actually paying for it we get those
 
01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:44.559 align:start position:0%
rebates back
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
paid to us it's obviously a substantial
 
01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
amount of money that pays for the
 
01:02:49.829 --> 01:02:49.839 align:start position:0%
majority of
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
our hiv programs so where we do get some
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
federal funding that you've seen
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
through the different accounting units
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
we're required actually first to use
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
our drug rebate money before we tap into
 
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
the federal funding
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
and so this funds a substantial portion
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
of our program a number of different
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
um positions and a lot of our contracts
 
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's basically like reinvesting back
 
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:11.839 align:start position:0%
into the program
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that so i'm looking at
 
01:03:14.319 --> 01:03:15.190 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that so i'm looking at
expense

01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
expense
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
item five three zero drug rebates
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
and that's an expense item that looks
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
like it wants to be an income line
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
and and is it is it pro what is that 530
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
paying for
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
shelly could you help me out with this
 
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.670 align:start position:0%
shelly could you help me out with this
class

01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
yes so in this class is um where the
 
01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:37.349 align:start position:0%
yes so in this class is um where the
payments

01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
payments
 
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
are made to our contracted vendor for
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
the actual prescriptions
 
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
as well as the other services that dr
 
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
daley spoke of
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
um that when we're required to pay the
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
rebates first
 
01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
the enrollees i i know that's not the
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
right word i'm sorry
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
um for their services out of this line
 
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:04:07.029 --> 01:04:07.039 align:start position:0%
before we are able to move over to the
 
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
federal funds that we get
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
um in accounting unit 2222
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
so basically that class is used to
 
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
purchase additional
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals i'm going to come off of
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
that area
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like there's a lot of cash
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
moving out
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
from uh private hands back to private
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
hands so
 
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
i'll come to you representative weiler
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
in just a second sir
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
um i i'm just hoping that this is
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
got great internal controls and great
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
auditing around it because it just feels
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
like it's
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
a cash rich business but representative
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
weiler do you have a
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
yes i recall in the past some of the
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
budgets we have used as much as
 
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
balancing the budget are we still
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
getting considerable
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
rebates from the companies so i think
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
you're thinking about medicaid drug
 
01:05:05.839 --> 01:05:06.950 align:start position:0%
you're thinking about medicaid drug
rebates

01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
rebates
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
um and we do still get substantial drug
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
rebates there
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
and those are budgeted in the medicaid
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
budget these drug rates that our
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
drug rebates are specific to the hiv
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
drugs that we purchase
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
so those get those get budgeted
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
because if there aren't i think we can
 
01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:34.839 align:start position:0%
go to 5170 disease control
 
01:05:34.839 --> 01:05:37.270 align:start position:0%
go to 5170 disease control
yes

01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
which is on mostly on page 1072.
 
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
so we're back to using general funds
 
01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.430 align:start position:0%
so we're back to using general funds
here

01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
yes shelly is there a match
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
so the federal money is just brought us
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
to for this program and then
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
we believe that we need to augment it
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
with general funds
 
01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
is that is that a proper way of saying
 
01:06:11.039 --> 01:06:13.029 align:start position:0%
is that is that a proper way of saying
it

01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
so the general funds that are in this
 
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
account are
 
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
to support disease control emergencies
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
there's i think a hundred thousand
 
01:06:21.359 --> 01:06:22.390 align:start position:0%
there's i think a hundred thousand
dollars

01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
that's there in case we have some type
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
of emergency or outbreak that we need to
 
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
respond to that and we have
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
funds available to be able to mount that
 
01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.789 align:start position:0%
funds available to be able to mount that
response

01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
response
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
because a lot of our federal funding is
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
really used for programmatic
 
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
work and so that fun those funds are
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
available sometimes we don't use them we
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
obviously won't use them if we don't
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
need them we've happened to have a
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
number of different emergencies over the
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
last few years that we've used
 
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
for example or during our hepatitis a
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
outbreak we've also used those funds
 
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:48.390 align:start position:0%
outbreak we've also used those funds
during

01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
during
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
our pfas response to help pay for
 
01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:51.829 align:start position:0%
our pfas response to help pay for
testing

01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
testing
 
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
um for the individuals who are impacted
 
01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
by those the water contamination
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
and then we also have funds in here
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
available to support
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis treatment for people who
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
require financial assistance if they
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
have tuberculosis which is highly
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
communicable and we obviously need
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
people to get
 
01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
treated for it and so again like our hiv
 
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
financial assistance we will also
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
help to pay for people's tuberculosis
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
medications until they're cured so that
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
transmitting their infection i i thought
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
we were on the cusp of
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
eradicating tb um
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
yes come back been working on
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis control for
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
a long day you know actually centuries
 
01:07:34.559 --> 01:07:35.270 align:start position:0%
a long day you know actually centuries
right

01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
um but no it does still exist we
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
primarily see it in people who have
 
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
international travel
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
or or who have lived internationally but
 
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
there are you know hundreds of people
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
each year in new hampshire who um have
 
01:07:48.079 --> 01:07:48.390 align:start position:0%
each year in new hampshire who um have
been

01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:07:51.029 --> 01:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
exposed and test you know have a skin
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
test showing that they have
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
uh have been exposed at some point in
 
01:07:55.349 --> 01:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
their lifetime and we want them to get
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
treated to prevent
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
actually becoming ill with active tb
 
01:07:59.670 --> 01:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
where they can cough and
 
01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:01.839 align:start position:0%
make people sick but we have about 20
 
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
cases of active tb
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
at what point do the are our new
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
newly arrived refugees get tested for tb
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
do they get tested for tb while they're
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
in their home country or
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
do we wait until they get to new
 
01:08:17.679 --> 01:08:18.870 align:start position:0%
do we wait until they get to new
hampshire

01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
they do get tested before they um
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
arrive in the case of like refugees
 
01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
right and then they also get tested
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
all right uh are there any other
 
01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing anything you can go okay
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
the next one is 5174
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
i just need to spend more of that in my
 
01:08:50.839 --> 01:08:55.430 align:start position:0%
i just need to spend more of that in my
yard

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
that's not very much money what do you
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
what do you what are you really doing
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
with forty thousand dollars
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
for a state this big so the way that
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
we're using these funds
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
is to purchase reagents laboratory
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
testing regions for our public health
 
01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:09.749 align:start position:0%
testing regions for our public health
lab

01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
lab
 
01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to do all the testing it does
 
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
for both mosquitoes
 
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
and and humans we do get a very small
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
funding from the federal government but
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
it's just you know i think it's less
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
than ten thousand or ten thousand
 
01:09:22.159 --> 01:09:22.789 align:start position:0%
than ten thousand or ten thousand
dollars

01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
it's really only enough to test humans
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
and what we need to do is test those
 
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
mosquitoes so we have early
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
indicators and warnings of when um we
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
are finding the different viruses
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
tripoli and west nile virus
 
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
out in the community so we can alert the
 
01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:37.749 align:start position:0%
out in the community so we can alert the
public

01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
that that's the lab costs so we know
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
what kind of mosquito diseases are
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
correct this account used to be bigger
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
and it included some reimbursement to
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
communities to be able
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
to spray like you were just mentioning
 
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
but over time that has been
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
reduced through the budgeting process to
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
okay coming down the next one is
 
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
5177 vaccine insurers
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
and uh this is one of those accounting
 
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
units that closed incorrectly there
 
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
should not have been general funds in
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
so are we on 5178 then sure
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's the immunization i'm sorry yeah
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
because there are no
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
there are no funds in the governor's
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
budget for this right
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
177 vaccines insurers there's a
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
revolving fund but there are no
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
general funds going in to replenish it
 
01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:49.430 align:start position:0%
general funds going in to replenish it
correct

01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
correct it's just the um money that
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
i don't remember where but from the
 
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.030 align:start position:0%
i don't remember where but from the
insurers

01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
insurers
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
who pay into a purchasing pool so that
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
we can purchase
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
vaccines that reduce cost off the cdc
 
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
contract and we purchase all vaccines
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
for children
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
in the state so okay i'm just gonna
 
01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:14.630 align:start position:0%
in the state so okay i'm just gonna
throw

01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
throw
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
a comment that a constituent made at me
 
01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:17.750 align:start position:0%
a comment that a constituent made at me
about

01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
six months ago she
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
she believed that
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
we had a profit motive
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
as a state to over vaccinate children
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
because every time we vaccinated a child
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
we would get money from the
 
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
and as she described it she was
 
01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.750 align:start position:0%
and as she described it she was
convinced

01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
convinced
 
01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
that there's a profit motive here that
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
is is potentially causing bad state
 
01:11:50.719 --> 01:11:51.669 align:start position:0%
is is potentially causing bad state
behavior

01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
with causing us to want to over
 
01:11:54.239 --> 01:11:55.590 align:start position:0%
with causing us to want to over
vaccinate

01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinate
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
how would you respond to that
 
01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
constituent well i would say that is not
 
01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:00.870 align:start position:0%
constituent well i would say that is not
true

01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
true
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh there's no uh profit or funding
 
01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
that's provided
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
based on how many kids were vaccinating
 
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
there's no kickbacks from pharmaceutical
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
companies and our only interest in
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
vaccinating children is to prevent
 
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
okay if you so but if you boil down what
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
she said to me the part that still seems
 
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
to have some truth into it
 
01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
is that the the vaccine
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
companies the suppliers are
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
giving us some amount of money based on
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
the total number of kids
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
we have vaccinated is that true or false
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
that is false these funds are coming
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
from the insurance companies
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
who are paying into a purchasing pool so
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
that they
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
can reduce their costs associated with
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
paying for vaccination for kids
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's not coming from pharmaceutical
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
companies we don't get any money from
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies relative to
 
01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:00.149 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies relative to
vaccines

01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
and we cannot use these funds for any
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
purpose other than that
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
hurt your strictest sons yeah correct
 
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative you have a question sir
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
oh yes sir thank you mr german so are
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
they paying
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
in voluntarily because it's less
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
expensive for them to
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
pay to the state and then the state can
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
get a better price on the vaccines
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
rather than them having to
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
buy them individually for each child
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
yes so there's a state law that is on
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
the books that creates the new hampshire
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine association where the insurers
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
come together
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
and pay in they are assessed uh a fee
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
based on their accessible lives um
 
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
and they there's a whole feeding process
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
that happens where they're paying into
 
01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:44.229 align:start position:0%
that happens where they're paying into
it

01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
um so that we can purchase these
 
01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:47.590 align:start position:0%
um so that we can purchase these
vaccines

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
it i don't believe that it's their
 
01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:50.790 align:start position:0%
it i don't believe that it's their
participation

01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
participation
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
is necessarily mandatory though i'd have
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
to go back and look at that but the
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
insurers like this program
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
and they participate in it because it
 
01:13:59.830 --> 01:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
caught saves about 10 million dollars
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
each year in their
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
in vaccine costs just for the vaccine
 
01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.070 align:start position:0%
in vaccine costs just for the vaccine
alone

01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
alone
 
01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
that's why it's wondering and so this is
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
the savings because you can buy it in
 
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
bulk as opposed to them
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
we can purchase it off of the federal
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
cdc contract
 
01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
which is offer substantial savings which
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
they cannot do
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
correct thank you representative
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
weiler i think it's also true that
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
some people's health insurance plans pay
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
for them to go and have these shots but
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
this way the shot would be less
 
01:14:31.199 --> 01:14:32.149 align:start position:0%
this way the shot would be less
expensive

01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
to the insurance company paying for it
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
than if they didn't
 
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:42.390 align:start position:0%
 
correct

01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
so uh miss rounds as i look at
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
is i look at where we are in the
 
01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.110 align:start position:0%
is i look at where we are in the
document

01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
i see an elevator bar that looks like
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
it's about 60 percent of the way down
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
are we finished when we get all the way
 
01:14:59.350 --> 01:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
to the bottom or we finish somewhere in
 
01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:00.149 align:start position:0%
to the bottom or we finish somewhere in
between

01:15:00.149 --> 01:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
here and the bottom and we're finished
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
way before that
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
i have a lot of extra pages in this pdf
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
of things that are at the end of the
 
01:15:06.719 --> 01:15:07.430 align:start position:0%
of things that are at the end of the
budget

01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
plus public health is probably
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
like starts somewhere shortly after the
 
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
middle of our budget
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
so we're done at page 1097 we're
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
currently on page
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
1074 so we only have about another 20
 
01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.630 align:start position:0%
1074 so we only have about another 20
pages

01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
pages
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
super thank you uh
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
5178 immunization program
 
01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:36.870 align:start position:0%
5178 immunization program
yes

01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
we're bumping up the general fund
 
01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:40.310 align:start position:0%
we're bumping up the general fund
contribute

01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
contribute
 
01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
contribution to the immunization program
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
a lot is
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
is what what is driving the increase
 
01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
in immunization effort
 
01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
i i mean obviously coved i mean
 
01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:55.430 align:start position:0%
i i mean obviously coved i mean
obviously

01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:15:57.990 --> 01:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
but i'm assuming that's covered by
 
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
federal money to pay for
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
shelly could you speak specifically to
 
01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
the general funds is this
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
due to the loss of federal funds through
 
01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:15.350 align:start position:0%
due to the loss of federal funds through
medicaid

01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
i can't answer that question dr nelly
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of loss of medicaid funds
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
okay i thought it might be related to
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
okay so i know what the federal funds
 
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
are for and there's a
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
echo i'm sorry i don't know if you're
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
the federal fund the general funds i'm
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
sorry it's primarily federally funded
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
the general funds that are in there
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
fund both our maintenance on our
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
immunization ordering system and vaccine
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
registry and it also funds um
 
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
a small amount of purchasing vaccines
 
01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
as a contribution to the the all
 
01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
the payer program that i had just
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned um there's an expectation that
 
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
the state contributes some amount of
 
01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:06.390 align:start position:0%
the state contributes some amount of
funds

01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
to help purchase vaccines as a state
 
01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
insurer what i'd like to what i'd like
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
to do dr daley
 
01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh is is uh suspend talking about this a
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
and and maybe come back to it and give
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
you guys a chance to
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
to really plow into it and make sure you
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
know what
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
what you're what what we're doing here
 
01:17:26.719 --> 01:17:27.590 align:start position:0%
what you're what what we're doing here
because

01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the federal funds going
 
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
up substantially from 2020
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
and then i'm looking at the general fund
 
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
going up way more than substantially
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
from 2020 and so this program is growing
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
rapidly both with federal and general
 
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.189 align:start position:0%
rapidly both with federal and general
funds

01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
and i would just like to know what is
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
driving that growth rate
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
and what's next what are is this trend
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
going to continue into the next budget
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
or are we
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
dealing with something transitional so
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
we can get you that follow-up
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
information okay
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
so maybe maybe we could just arrange a
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
phone call or something
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
um i think we can provide it all in
 
01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:11.750 align:start position:0%
um i think we can provide it all in
writing

01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
writing
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's primarily due to a
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
new temporary full-time position
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
and an increase in line 103 so we'll get
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
you what that
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
actually is and what it's for all right
 
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
so you'll follow up with us
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
sure the next one is 5179 hospital
 
01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:32.870 align:start position:0%
sure the next one is 5179 hospital
acquired

01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
acquired
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
infections and there are no general
 
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
yes so what happens with this account it
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
funds our hospital acquired infections
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
program we're required to
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
try to secure federal funds before we
 
01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
feed the health care facilities to pay
 
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
for this program
 
01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
and that's what the other funds are here
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
the agency income funds is a fee system
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
and so over time there's been quite a
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
bit of fluctuation in terms of what cdc
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
is funding it started off
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
when this program first started that it
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
was primarily federally funded and then
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
cdc decreased their funding and they
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
unfunded a few of our positions that we
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
then had to
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
pay for through fees and now they have
 
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
instilled more funding into the program
 
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
and we've been able to
 
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
um to pay for the positions again
 
01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
through federal funds
 
01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you great explanation
 
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
what's next uh 5084 is ebola that
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
account has been closed out
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.990 align:start position:0%
 
prevention

01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
okay so to what extent does this program
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
overlap with the family planning dollars
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
that has
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
a small piece of it dedicated to std
 
01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:06.629 align:start position:0%
a small piece of it dedicated to std
prevention

01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
so um and i don't know if psy or trish
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
want to chime in on how the
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
how the this overlaps with family
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
planning but
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
um these our funds are really targeted
 
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
specifically to
 
01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
stds they're identifying them through
 
01:20:22.709 --> 01:20:22.719 align:start position:0%
testing and then
 
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
investigating the individual cases we do
 
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
some prevention work but it's primarily
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
around the control of
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
identity you know once we identify those
 
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
infections and then we investigate them
 
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
we do work in partnership with the
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
family planning program to make sure
 
01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:37.430 align:start position:0%
family planning program to make sure
that

01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
we're not duplicating efforts and that
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
so so even though the word says
 
01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.430 align:start position:0%
so so even though the word says
prevention

01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
it sounds like most of the money you're
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
spending is really on
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
on treatment
 
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
yes and identifying testing
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
identification and then
 
01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
investigating those cases and you know
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
trying to do disease control work around
 
01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:04.950 align:start position:0%
trying to do disease control work around
them

01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
drop in general funds here is is that
 
01:21:07.679 --> 01:21:08.470 align:start position:0%
drop in general funds here is is that
intentional

01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
intentional
 
01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
or or is there a priority's need that's
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh the drop in general funds i believe
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
is the
 
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
we had a prioritized need that we had in
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
the last
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
budget cycle that was funded and then
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
it's being unfunded
 
01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
in this budget is that right shelly
 
01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
yes we didn't put it forward for the
 
01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:40.830 align:start position:0%
yes we didn't put it forward for the
2223

01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:50.229 align:start position:0%
 
biennium

01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
i do have a question about std still
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
does does the department maintain
 
01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
a dashboard so that
 
01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:04.639 align:start position:0%
everyone can see how what kind of stds
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
are in new hampshire and what the trends
 
01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:07.830 align:start position:0%
are in new hampshire and what the trends
are

01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
for increase or decrease um
 
01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
is there is there a place that people
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
can go
 
01:22:17.669 --> 01:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
to for them to get visibility into the
 
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
std situation
 
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
yes we do have uh static data reports
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
not necessarily an
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
interactive dashboard that are available
 
01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
on our website we produce a monthly
 
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
report as well as a more comprehensive
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
five-year report on stds and hiv
 
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
and those are available on our website
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
we can send you the link
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
afterwards you know i'm more concerned
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
information is accessible to high school
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
nurses and it's getting out into the
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
high school population
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
so that kids are being warned that this
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
stuff is real
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
and being in that age group i think they
 
01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:56.639 align:start position:0%
need to hear that a lot
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm just curious the extent to which
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
actively broadcasting to the audience
 
01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
of high school students is it is is it
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
is it getting or is this message getting
 
01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:10.629 align:start position:0%
is it getting or is this message getting
through

01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
i don't want to scare kids i just want
 
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
to know how them know what's going on
 
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
i do think that they cover these topics
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
in um
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
you know in health education programs in
 
01:23:24.390 --> 01:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
schools honestly we see stds across the
 
01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
lifespan we do have the highest numbers
 
01:23:29.669 --> 01:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
of chlamydia for example in 15 to 24
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
year olds but there's a great deal of
 
01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:31.910 align:start position:0%
year olds but there's a great deal of
education

01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
that is happening and it really comes
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
down to you know personal
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
behavior choices and i would just add
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
i would just add that our family
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
planning programs this is where that
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
really comes in where
 
01:23:45.189 --> 01:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
um individuals are receiving care
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
they're getting tremendous amount of
 
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
education at that point
 
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
around how to reduce their risk we also
 
01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
have a pretty robust social media um
 
01:23:54.159 --> 01:23:54.790 align:start position:0%
have a pretty robust social media um
work

01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
right now um again sort of aiming at
 
01:23:58.229 --> 01:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
that younger
 
01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
and as well as an older population about
 
01:24:02.229 --> 01:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
risks around
 
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
sexually transmitted diseases we also
 
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
have some other work
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
in cytralas dr triala's group around
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
a program called the pregnancy
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
prevention program or the prep program
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
and within that is a significant amount
 
01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
of education again focused at a younger
 
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.030 align:start position:0%
of education again focused at a younger
population

01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
good good i i i just remember
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
hearing it once in a gym class
 
01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
and never hearing it again in high
 
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
school and so
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
i you know this is kind of more of the
 
01:24:38.229 --> 01:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
constant drum beat
 
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
seems like it may be effective but times
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
have changed representative edwards
 
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
heard me
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
times have changed i i think somebody
 
01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:49.530 align:start position:0%
else has mentioned that to me
 
01:24:49.530 --> 01:24:51.189 align:start position:0%
else has mentioned that to me
[Laughter]

01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
my kids for example okay
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
so um i think are there any other
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
questions on 75
 
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
36 all right
 
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh 50 22
 
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
is zika preparedness that grant has
 
01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:09.510 align:start position:0%
is zika preparedness that grant has
ended

01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
ended
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh moving down to 50 93 adult
 
01:25:12.719 --> 01:25:13.870 align:start position:0%
uh moving down to 50 93 adult
immunization

01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
immunization
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
pphf also has ended
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
the same thing with 5094 syndrome
 
01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:21.350 align:start position:0%
the same thing with 5094 syndrome
surveillance

01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
surveillance
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
so moving down to public health crisis
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
response 70
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
keep going okay uh
 
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
so first i would just say thank you dr
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
daly for joining us uh i
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
know how busy you are and i appreciate
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
you taking the time to
 
01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you dr valley yeah thank
 
01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
you so much i really appreciated
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
your your answers um
 
01:25:58.440 --> 01:25:58.450 align:start position:0%
and then uh
 
01:25:58.450 --> 01:26:00.310 align:start position:0%
and then uh
[Music]

01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
lisa is christine yes dr bean
 
01:26:06.070 --> 01:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh is on if you would allow her and
 
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
just bring her in now
 
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:24.719 align:start position:0%
just give her a second so that um she
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
all right great so the first one is 1835
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
which is new hampshire
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's epidemiology laboratory capacity
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:58.709 --> 01:26:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
all right okay the next one
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
is 1878 which
 
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
is the um lab equipment fund
 
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
this is also um this is actually a
 
01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:17.990 align:start position:0%
this is also um this is actually a
revolving

01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
revolving
 
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:20.719 align:start position:0%
fund shelly what's the source of funds
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
um fees that come into the lab
 
01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
so i recalled somewhere in our briefings
 
01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
that we had
 
01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
some significantly aging lab equipment
 
01:27:42.870 --> 01:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
and we needed
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of replacement is that this
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
area is this activity um it
 
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
is an accounting unit a little further
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
down that we have a prioritized need
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for remembering representative
 
01:27:56.719 --> 01:27:58.790 align:start position:0%
thank you for remembering representative
edwards

01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
edwards
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
i can't treat patients but i can buy
 
01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
okay the next accounting unit is 3063
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
the association of public health labs
 
01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:18.159 --> 01:28:22.950 align:start position:0%
 
here

01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:26.110 --> 01:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
now are these paid by
 
01:28:29.790 --> 01:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
pathologists or in places that employ
 
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
pathologists who's paying for these
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
this is the association of public health
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
labs who provide some project-based
 
01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
funding for us there's an association we
 
01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
have membership of as do all the
 
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
state public health laboratories
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
so who is a member of that for example
 
01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
i i can add to it if you'd like me to
 
01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:54.709 align:start position:0%
i i can add to it if you'd like me to
our

01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
public health laboratory is a member of
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
the association of public health
 
01:28:58.320 --> 01:28:58.950 align:start position:0%
the association of public health
laboratories

01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
laboratories
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
we pay an annual dues as a state member
 
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire is a member
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
and there are oftentimes
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
funds available for special projects for
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
us to
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
implement new types of testing that they
 
01:29:14.239 --> 01:29:14.709 align:start position:0%
implement new types of testing that they
are

01:29:14.709 --> 01:29:14.719 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
able to support us to do
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
okay i'm just looking at the 174 000
 
01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:24.639 align:start position:0%
and as small as new hampshire is i'm
 
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
just wondering
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
if these dues are are are really onerous
 
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
to the members but these
 
01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that's not our dues no
 
01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
yeah these aren't dues these are money
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
this is much sent to us for projects
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
right oh okay so like if you go to the
 
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
the next page so the private local funds
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
these are these are not dues correct
 
01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
no these are funds that we could um have
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
access to to implement projects
 
01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:02.639 align:start position:0%
um it could be a training for a
 
01:30:02.639 --> 01:30:03.669 align:start position:0%
um it could be a training for a
laboratory

01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
laboratory
 
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
yes it's a revenue source that's correct
 
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
somebody's paying it i was just trying
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
to get my arms around who
 
01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
is paying it the association is so the
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
association that we are part of that we
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
pay dues to be part of
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
then gives us money back to run projects
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
okay great are there any other questions
 
01:30:29.199 --> 01:30:31.830 align:start position:0%
okay great are there any other questions
here

01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
all right are we at 51.26
 
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
yes which is the ebola eos elc which
 
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
ended in
 
01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
21 so moving right down to 79.66
 
01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
which is the public health laboratory
 
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
also where the prioritized need is the
 
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
prioritized need is for 50 000
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
in general funds for 22 and 100 000 for
 
01:30:58.470 --> 01:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
general funds and 23
 
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
all of which would be for lab equipment
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
is it because there are new things we
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
can test for
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
or are we replacing old equipment to
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh dr beanie do you want to answer that
 
01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:15.590 align:start position:0%
uh dr beanie do you want to answer that
sure

01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:31:17.910 --> 01:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
i would say that it's for both of those
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
things so we need to maintain
 
01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure and re replace
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
aging equipment and instruments
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
one example of that we had this year was
 
01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
the deionized water systems in our
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
laboratory or di water
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
that we need to maintain that
 
01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in order to keep the
 
01:31:42.149 --> 01:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
lab operations uninterrupted
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
so in addition to that we do need to
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
purchase new instrumentation and
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
modernize the laboratory as new methods
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
become available
 
01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
much of that funding in many cases is
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
available through federal
 
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
funds but not all of it so
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's for both aging instruments and
 
01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.229 align:start position:0%
it's for both aging instruments and
modernization

01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
modernization
 
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
both okay so
 
01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:08.719 align:start position:0%
um i see general funds of 3.836
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
million you you would like that to be
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
3.9 million
 
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
is that what your prioritized need would
 
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
do am i hearing you right
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's an addition it's an additional
 
01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:22.390 align:start position:0%
that's an addition it's an additional
150

01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
150
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
000 over the biennium
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
like it was 50 in the first year 100 in
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
the second
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
that's correct uh
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
laboratory um uh repairs
 
01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
new instrumentation is uh very very
 
01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.390 align:start position:0%
new instrumentation is uh very very
expensive

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
um uh different than uh
 
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
other other kinds of uh equipment
 
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
worked in the radiology world but i i
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
kept an eye on what was going on
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
in pathology it is expensive stuff yeah
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
all right well great uh are there
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
questions here
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
for from the committee we're back into
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
general funds here and it's
 
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
it's not an insignificant amount
 
01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
i just see the i see the 800 000 roughly
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
a little less i guess
 
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
general fund increase i think i'm
 
01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
reading that right
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
but i'm just having a hard time picking
 
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
up where that is up above i see there's
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
a slight
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
decrease in the some of the agency
 
01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:30.390 align:start position:0%
decrease in the some of the agency
income

01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
income
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
and a pretty big deal oh it's in the d
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
this in the general fund's decreased no
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
there is a decrease there in the federal
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
funds and this is this isn't
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
all cost allocated federal funds there's
 
01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:48.830 align:start position:0%
all cost allocated federal funds there's
no

01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
um there's no direct
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
grant federal grant to this area so
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
these are allocated federal funds from
 
01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
other areas in public health
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
for work that the lab is doing um
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
and the allocation changed on the
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
positions based on the work that they're
 
01:34:04.719 --> 01:34:07.189 align:start position:0%
positions based on the work that they're
doing

01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
that's one of those things that's
 
01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
controlled by the higher-ups people
 
01:34:11.669 --> 01:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
higher than you
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
yes or at least it's
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
yeah it's the thing that's controlled by
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
our our cost allocation plan and
 
01:34:22.629 --> 01:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you
 
01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
so ms rounds for for the 150k
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
over the biennium yes would you
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
just email us the list of what would be
 
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
purchased and where it would physically
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
go to be located
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't be surprised if it was just
 
01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
like two or three items is all but
 
01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:46.090 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:46.090 --> 01:34:49.430 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
yeah right yes we will get you that
 
01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:53.669 align:start position:0%
yeah right yes we will get you that
information

01:34:53.669 --> 01:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
and i assume that list represents what
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
you would forego buying
 
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
if we didn't plus up this account
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
correct yes okay very good can we uh
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
can we move on sure so the next one
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
is the 8276 food emergency response
 
01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:15.750 align:start position:0%
is the 8276 food emergency response
network

01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
network
 
01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
any questions not seeing any we can go
 
01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:29.750 align:start position:0%
any questions not seeing any we can go
on

01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
okay and then the last one in this area
 
01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:32.950 align:start position:0%
okay and then the last one in this area
is

01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
8280 which is the biomonitoring grant
 
01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:49.189 align:start position:0%
 
federal

01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
all right thank you all right
 
01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you dr b and thank you
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
you're not related to harry bean are you
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative harry bean
 
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
no i'm not it's talking to him he's
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
related to like half the people in new
 
01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:08.310 align:start position:0%
related to like half the people in new
hampshire

01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much all right
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
all right the next one is one one one
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
one homeland security and
 
01:36:25.109 --> 01:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
uh lisa did you want to bring over ian i
 
01:36:25.119 --> 01:36:25.669 align:start position:0%
uh lisa did you want to bring over ian i
know

01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
that he is fairly new but uh
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
we're gonna uh trisha's uh trisha is uh
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
available to answer some of these
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
questions as am i
 
01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay great so i believe that yeah this
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
transfer comes from homeland security so
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
it comes from the department of safety
 
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of money no
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
yeah the next one is one one
 
01:36:59.109 --> 01:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
one two which is homeland security
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
well this is radiological emergency
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh prevention thank you our program
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
so this one we've got some general funds
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
and we got
 
01:37:25.109 --> 01:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
three times the general funds as we do
 
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
am i reading that right uh
 
01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
there are also there's also agency
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
but yeah where's the agency income
 
01:37:44.709 --> 01:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh i would
 
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
can you answer uh some of these
 
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
questions is this
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh through the esu
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
you know what we're gonna have i i don't
 
01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
know that that the esu doesn't receive
 
01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
that income i believe so we will have to
 
01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
get back to you on that
 
01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
for radiological work
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
so as i remember from the briefing we
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
did radiological surveys
 
01:38:15.910 --> 01:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
routinely around the nuclear plant and
 
01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:17.189 align:start position:0%
routinely around the nuclear plant and
the

01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
basically the the fallout zone of
 
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
is in a and if that's all we're doing
 
01:38:32.709 --> 01:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
it just looks like a lot of money to do
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
just that
 
01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
so i believe these are uh
 
01:38:40.229 --> 01:38:40.239 align:start position:0%
there is the uh uh rep program
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
in protection and we just have to
 
01:38:42.639 --> 01:38:43.350 align:start position:0%
in protection and we just have to
understand

01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:38:47.109 --> 01:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
what um what this particular um
 
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh au is and i apologize for not having
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
that information but we will get that
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
for you
 
01:38:55.590 --> 01:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
okay all right all right that that's
 
01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:56.310 align:start position:0%
okay all right all right that that's
fair

01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
fair
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
yeah it's just dividing out between
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
what's in protection and what's in this
 
01:39:01.109 --> 01:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
unit and
 
01:39:02.709 --> 01:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
as you know these are brand new funds to
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
dphs so we're still getting our
 
01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
um okay so so if we're monitoring c
 
01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
c brook somebody had to have that
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
program before dhhs had it then
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
so it got transferred from somebody it
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
got transferred from the office of the
 
01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner and i should have asked my
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
finance person for the office the
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner to be on today and i
 
01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
didn't think too so that's i'm sorry
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
that we'll just have to follow up
 
01:39:35.590 --> 01:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
no problem okay so we can go to 1113
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
i think yes
 
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
which is hospital preparedness and this
 
01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:56.470 align:start position:0%
 
federal

01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:00.639 align:start position:0%
what's the next one uh the next one is
 
01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh 11 14 which is public health
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
which does have some general funds in it
 
01:40:10.709 --> 01:40:10.719 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
sorry so you have
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
you have 24 people in public health
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
emergency preparedness
 
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
wondering if one of them moved
 
01:40:35.669 --> 01:40:35.679 align:start position:0%
yeah they must have i've just not seen
 
01:40:35.679 --> 01:40:37.590 align:start position:0%
yeah they must have i've just not seen
any

01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
so so if i i can jump in and probably
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
shelly can provide some greater clarity
 
01:40:42.709 --> 01:40:42.719 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
um the phet program um has
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
been uh historically based within our
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
infectious disease program it is moving
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
over into the emergency services
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
to our new bureau of public health
 
01:40:54.719 --> 01:40:55.830 align:start position:0%
to our new bureau of public health
preparedness

01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
preparedness
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
um with that um it's a pretty robust
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
federal funding source and it has funded
 
01:41:01.590 --> 01:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
a number of
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
positions throughout both the division
 
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
and historically when the esu was in the
 
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
so they're spread around we are doing
 
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
some um you know consolidating right now
 
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
of trying to get all the positions in
 
01:41:16.149 --> 01:41:16.159 align:start position:0%
the right place
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
okay so is there a match or an moe here
 
01:41:25.590 --> 01:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
and if it's a match go ahead i'm sorry i
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
didn't mean to interrupt you
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
um the notice of award um states that we
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
have to match 10
 
01:41:36.629 --> 01:41:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
so it's not always the same dollar
 
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
amount sir
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
so is there a maximum though if they
 
01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
said we could do 10
 
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
up to a certain level no there's no
 
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.550 align:start position:0%
up to a certain level no there's no
maximum

01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
if there are additional questions um dr
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
daly is still on the call
 
01:41:59.910 --> 01:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh this particular au has been in her uh
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
well if we don't if we only have a 10
 
01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:08.390 align:start position:0%
well if we don't if we only have a 10
percent

01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
match here this is really is
 
01:42:14.709 --> 01:42:14.719 align:start position:0%
to use miss tilly's remark this is a
 
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
really a rich source of federal funding
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm just curious do did you have
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
any prioritized
 
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
needs here are you are you do you feel
 
01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:25.510 align:start position:0%
needs here are you are you do you feel
like

01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:42:29.109 --> 01:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
this program is adequate 24 people to me
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
sounds like a lot of people
 
01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure what what they're doing
 
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
on a day-to-day basis
 
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have dr daley uh talk about
 
01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
this hey you
 
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so historically we have
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
used this funding
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
to increase our preparedness and there's
 
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
about 15 different capabilities that we
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
need to
 
01:42:53.109 --> 01:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
address it includes things like making
 
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
sure that we can carry out mass
 
01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:55.990 align:start position:0%
sure that we can carry out mass
vaccination

01:42:55.990 --> 01:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
making sure that we have laboratory
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
testing in place epidemiology people who
 
01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
are investigating different potential
 
01:43:02.790 --> 01:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
public health threats
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
and so we've actually used the funding
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
to fund very
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
core infrastructure for public health we
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
use about eight positions
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
um seven or eight positions are funded
 
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
in the bureau of infectious disease
 
01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:14.470 align:start position:0%
in the bureau of infectious disease
control

01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
control
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
these are nurse investigators
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
epidemiologists people looking at data
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
systems to try and identify any
 
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
potential public health threats
 
01:43:22.950 --> 01:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
we also find about the same number of
 
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
positions in our laboratory
 
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
these are people who are testing for
 
01:43:29.189 --> 01:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
example white powder that you
 
01:43:31.109 --> 01:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
might find on an envelope those types of
 
01:43:33.669 --> 01:43:33.679 align:start position:0%
events still happen following 9 11.
 
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
we also fund a number of positions in
 
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
our new bureau
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
which was previously the emergency
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
services unit these are people who are
 
01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:41.669 align:start position:0%
services unit these are people who are
writing

01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
writing
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
plans working with our partners to
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
ensure our preparedness statewide
 
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:48.719 align:start position:0%
so they're doing more than preparing
 
01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
they're actually doing
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
things like lab work and going out into
 
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
the communities
 
01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
and and checking on things
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
we are doing response work in addition
 
01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
to the preparedness work but they have
 
01:44:04.709 --> 01:44:04.719 align:start position:0%
those obligations when not responding to
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
making sure our plans are in place um
 
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
you know keeping those up
 
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
up to date and making that networking
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
with our partners which has been so
 
01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:12.470 align:start position:0%
with our partners which has been so
critical

01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
critical
 
01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
even for covet 19 a lot of these staff
 
01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
currently are engaged in covet 19 work
 
01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so so that makes sense but um what
 
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
to what
 
01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
if you have 24 authorized what is your
 
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
vacancy on that do you know that's a
 
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
trivia question
 
01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
um actually currently i am i don't
 
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
believe we have
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
any vacancies at all among those you
 
01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:34.629 align:start position:0%
any vacancies at all among those you
know

01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
obviously like any program you will have
 
01:44:37.990 --> 01:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
periodic vacancies but i think we're
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:45.510 --> 01:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you have clinicians in
 
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
there people who could be clinicians
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
well we have some public health nursing
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
staff and they do
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
our investigations talking to health
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
care providers and patients about their
 
01:44:59.430 --> 01:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
different infectious
 
01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
diseases they do outbreak response we
 
01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:03.679 align:start position:0%
have you know 100 outbreaks a year
 
01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire um and so they're doing
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
work that's appropriate to their
 
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
clinical training
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
so public health nurses tend to be rns
 
01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
as well right and they have
 
01:45:16.229 --> 01:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
additional training as public health
 
01:45:16.239 --> 01:45:17.669 align:start position:0%
additional training as public health
specialists

01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
specialists
 
01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
yes or on the job uh training their
 
01:45:21.990 --> 01:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
nursing skills while they're there may
 
01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
not be drawing blood and doing clinical
 
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
functions their nursing skills
 
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
is transferable that knowledge that they
 
01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
need in order to do investigations and
 
01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
interacting with the healthcare
 
01:45:31.199 --> 01:45:32.470 align:start position:0%
interacting with the healthcare
community

01:45:32.470 --> 01:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:45:35.669 --> 01:45:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh works very well the core
 
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
the core of this fep work really
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
prepared us
 
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
um for our covid outbreak and our
 
01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
crowbit response right now so it's
 
01:45:43.679 --> 01:45:43.990 align:start position:0%
crowbit response right now so it's
really

01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
fundament as as dr daley said it is the
 
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
fundamental infrastructure we have
 
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
to um prepare for respond and recover
 
01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:52.390 align:start position:0%
to um prepare for respond and recover
from

01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
any um great infectious disease outbreak
 
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh very good are
 
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
okay okay that's the uh classic counting
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
unit in that hero and
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
the uh very last accounting unit for
 
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
public health is 1380 which is
 
01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:16.310 align:start position:0%
public health is 1380 which is
prescription

01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
drug monitoring and i believe there's a
 
01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
couple of people that need to come over
 
01:46:22.950 --> 01:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
he said trish could you just share with
 
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
kevin who that needs to be
 
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so i believe lindsay courtney is in
 
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
the audience right now
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
who is the director of the officer
 
01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:40.229 --> 01:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
and so we've asked lindsay to join us
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
today um she knows the detail around
 
01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
these budgets these budgets have just
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
been transfer
 
01:46:48.149 --> 01:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
transferred over to dphs
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
um and so um you know as you know and as
 
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
we've talked about in our introduction
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
we know that you know the pdmps are
 
01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:55.910 align:start position:0%
we know that you know the pdmps are
designed

01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
designed
 
01:46:58.709 --> 01:46:58.719 align:start position:0%
to improve both patient safety and and
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
improve public health
 
01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
with the goal of reducing overdose
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
deaths and hospitalizations
 
01:47:07.189 --> 01:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
and within the governor's budget there's
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
this notion that we're going to move the
 
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
program over
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
to dhhs from oplc
 
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
okay and also to prevent future
 
01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
addictions this is the other
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
process all right
 
01:47:23.590 --> 01:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm not seeing general funds under
 
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
total source of funds
 
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.229 --> 01:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
none none that i am aware of i just
 
01:47:35.669 --> 01:47:35.679 align:start position:0%
don't know what's on this next page
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
there are um funds associated with
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
um agency income what we see on here as
 
01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
well is
 
01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
um some uh cost recoveries which i'm
 
01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:46.229 align:start position:0%
um some uh cost recoveries which i'm
gonna

01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
ask our our finance people to talk a
 
01:47:49.750 --> 01:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
little bit or lindsay to talk about a
 
01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:49.990 align:start position:0%
little bit or lindsay to talk about a
little

01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
little
 
01:47:52.870 --> 01:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
bit and then some transfers that have
 
01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:54.470 align:start position:0%
bit and then some transfers that have
occurred

01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
01:47:56.790 --> 01:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why the governor's
 
01:47:58.149 --> 01:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
office was interested in moving this
 
01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
within dhhs
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
is dhhs has a number of federal grants
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
cdc grants in which we transfer some of
 
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
that money
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
over to the prescription drug monitoring
 
01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:12.629 align:start position:0%
over to the prescription drug monitoring
program

01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's obviously a good program the
 
01:48:16.870 --> 01:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
objectives are really good i don't i
 
01:48:18.149 --> 01:48:18.159 align:start position:0%
don't know how well it's being
 
01:48:20.149 --> 01:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
implemented or executed but it's
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's the right thing to be doing so
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
are there any questions about this from
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
do we want to go to the next one then it
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're all
 
01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
all keyed up to to give me a five minute
 
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
briefing on this but
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
but i think we're good miss tilly thank
 
01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:42.070 align:start position:0%
but i think we're good miss tilly thank
you

01:48:42.070 --> 01:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
this is it representative you have a
 
01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:45.590 align:start position:0%
this is it representative you have a
question

01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:48:47.189 --> 01:48:47.199 align:start position:0%
just a quick question so i noticed that
 
01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
the other agency transfers fund
 
01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
funds dropped way off in the second year
 
01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
in 23.
 
01:48:57.590 --> 01:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
is there a reason for that could you
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
stick to that or
 
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll take a first swing and then if
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
um miss courtney is here attorney
 
01:49:05.430 --> 01:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
courtney's here she can fill in if i if
 
01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
i get it wrong
 
01:49:08.229 --> 01:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of these federal
 
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
funding sources and i think
 
01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
it was unclear at the time of the
 
01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
drafting of the budget um
 
01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
if there would be rollover or what the
 
01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
exact amount would be in those future
 
01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:17.910 align:start position:0%
exact amount would be in those future
years

01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
so we anticipate that that we will need
 
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
to go through some sort of accept and
 
01:49:22.629 --> 01:49:22.639 align:start position:0%
expend process
 
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
um once the once we have a firmer idea
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
of what those dollars will how the how
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
many dollars will be available from
 
01:49:33.189 --> 01:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:36.310 --> 01:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up nope
 
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
okay so i think we can continue
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
unless there's absolutely something you
 
01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
feel like you
 
01:49:45.510 --> 01:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
need to say to us about 1380 i don't
 
01:49:46.149 --> 01:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:49:49.589 --> 01:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
no thunder stolen we're good we think
 
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
it's a great program
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
we're in agreement that it should it can
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh all right so where are we
 
01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
are you you're you're summing up is this
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
the summation of the public health
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
budget mrs rounds it is it is and you'll
 
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
notice that
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh general funds across all of public
 
01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
health um
 
01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
did decrease in uh fiscal year 22 they
 
01:50:22.830 --> 01:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
and then went back up a little bit and
 
01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:24.550 align:start position:0%
and then went back up a little bit and
23.

01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
23.
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
that completes public health and so
 
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you lisa trish
 
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
and shelly for being on as well as the
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%

01:50:38.070 --> 01:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
every single
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
page of the dhhs budget it's been a
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
great pleasure
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
wonderful so representative earth your
 
01:50:48.149 --> 01:50:48.159 align:start position:0%
hand is up
 
01:50:51.030 --> 01:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
can i ask you a general question karen
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
yeah of course
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
have you had a chance to look at the
 
01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
recently passed federal bill and
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
anticipate what impact they might have
 
01:50:59.040 --> 01:50:59.830 align:start position:0%
anticipate what impact they might have
on

01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
your funding in the coming years um
 
01:51:06.790 --> 01:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
so i i have not um
 
01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
i i don't know is the um is the document
 
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
out yet
 
01:51:13.350 --> 01:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
i don't think all of the wording is out
 
01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
quite yet uh
 
01:51:15.910 --> 01:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
you may have seen during the
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
presentation i did get an email
 
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
from out i always say the acronym wrong
 
01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:23.109 align:start position:0%
from out i always say the acronym wrong
but

01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
i opened it briefly there i have some
 
01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
summary documents
 
01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
um as some funding we're anticipating um
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
we have made some adjustments in the
 
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
medicaid budget there were some
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
adjustments made in the governor's phase
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
anticipating that we would get the
 
01:51:38.159 --> 01:51:39.189 align:start position:0%
anticipating that we would get the
enhanced

01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
enhanced
 
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
fmap through december uh which i think
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
we talked about in the medicaid budget
 
01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
um beyond that uh
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
i have not had a chance to really think
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
through what impact that might have on
 
01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:51.109 align:start position:0%
through what impact that might have on
the

01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
22 budget thank you
 
01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
i think the largest impact really
 
01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
probably is is decisions that are not
 
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
um the department's decisions which is
 
01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:03.109 align:start position:0%
um the department's decisions which is
the

01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:05.669 --> 01:52:05.679 align:start position:0%
potential uh general aid that's coming
 
01:52:08.790 --> 01:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:11.589 --> 01:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
so somewhere in the public health budget
 
01:52:11.599 --> 01:52:12.629 align:start position:0%
so somewhere in the public health budget
um

01:52:12.629 --> 01:52:12.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
we have money that we contract with the
 
01:52:17.430 --> 01:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire
 
01:52:20.790 --> 01:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
who augment about 50
 
01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
of the salaries of some of the
 
01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:24.470 align:start position:0%
of the salaries of some of the
professors

01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
professors
 
01:52:26.709 --> 01:52:26.719 align:start position:0%
and i had asked before we got into
 
01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
public health
 
01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
if you would point out to me where we
 
01:52:32.229 --> 01:52:32.239 align:start position:0%
had those contracts
 
01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
and i i don't i don't recall hearing
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh so i don't i i apologize i didn't
 
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
recall that as a
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
question that we needed to respond to so
 
01:52:47.109 --> 01:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
um we will certainly get you that
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
information in public health
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think it's a great opportunity
 
01:52:55.990 --> 01:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
for us to leverage academia
 
01:52:58.470 --> 01:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
and it helps the university and it helps
 
01:52:58.480 --> 01:52:59.189 align:start position:0%
and it helps the university and it helps
us

01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
i i just would like to understand it
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
better and
 
01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
where it's at and what we're doing and
 
01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
and why it's such a smart thing for new
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire to be doing
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
and we have we have those spread
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
throughout budgets um
 
01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
several in dr tarala's shop um as well
 
01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:15.669 align:start position:0%
several in dr tarala's shop um as well
as

01:53:15.669 --> 01:53:15.679 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
through our preventive services block
 
01:53:19.750 --> 01:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
grant and and other activity areas but
 
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
it is spread around because we do really
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:27.510 --> 01:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
a good partnership representative rogers
 
01:53:29.109 --> 01:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
i just want to come back to you
 
01:53:32.070 --> 01:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
you started the morning with a lot of
 
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
questions about tobacco secession and
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
and e-cigarettes and and then and then
 
01:53:39.669 --> 01:53:39.679 align:start position:0%
you were quiet on us so i'm just curious
 
01:53:41.189 --> 01:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
if you want to
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
speak up before we come off of public
 
01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:44.790 align:start position:0%
speak up before we come off of public
health

01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
no i just have a concern of um if we can
 
01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
possibly add some more money that the
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
governor didn't add and the smoking
 
01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:54.870 align:start position:0%
governor didn't add and the smoking
cessation

01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
cessation
 
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's all your time what dollar amount
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
are you thinking
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure at this point i mean i
 
01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
know that he
 
01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
the agency requested 400 000 i guess so
 
01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
um somewhere in any range from zero to
 
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
four hundred thousand i'm not sure at
 
01:54:12.390 --> 01:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
this point
 
01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
okay no no no pressure i'm
 
01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
thinking that on uh on thursday we can
 
01:54:21.589 --> 01:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
begin having some of those detailed kind
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
of questions or
 
01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:26.000 align:start position:0%

of the new hampshire veterans home
 
02:01:15.910 --> 02:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
in the next two years our
 
02:01:17.669 --> 02:01:17.679 align:start position:0%
budget was put together in compliance
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
with governor sununu's
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
requests and this budget has been
 
02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:23.109 align:start position:0%
requests and this budget has been
prepared

02:01:23.109 --> 02:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
um with the planning assumption of
 
02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
having 225 residents
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
in our home at that time for those of
 
02:01:30.719 --> 02:01:31.990 align:start position:0%
in our home at that time for those of
you

02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:01:34.870 --> 02:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
inquiring minds we have 92 residents
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
living in our home today
 
02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
we do have 16 residents approved
 
02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
into the tar welch side of the house and
 
02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
that is the heavy medical
 
02:01:48.550 --> 02:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
side of the house as well as 21 veterans
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
waiting to get into our life enhancement
 
02:01:52.629 --> 02:01:52.639 align:start position:0%
dementia unit i will tell you that my
 
02:01:53.910 --> 02:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
admissions staff
 
02:01:56.470 --> 02:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
is working on approximately 86 active
 
02:01:58.390 --> 02:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
applications at this time
 
02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
and through that process is when it is
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
determined on whether a resident would
 
02:02:03.270 --> 02:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
be best met
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
their needs on the tar side of the house
 
02:02:06.790 --> 02:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
or on the dementia
 
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
side of the house and as you can imagine
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
we only
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
would have a veteran live on the
 
02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
dementia side of the house if he is
 
02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:13.510 align:start position:0%
dementia side of the house if he is
either

02:02:13.510 --> 02:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
either
 
02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
he or she is a danger to themselves or
 
02:02:20.310 --> 02:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
um or as a wandering risk we never want
 
02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:21.430 align:start position:0%
um or as a wandering risk we never want
to

02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
put our residents in an area where they
 
02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:24.470 align:start position:0%
put our residents in an area where they
um

02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
are confined at all um unless
 
02:02:32.790 --> 02:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely necessary uh
 
02:02:34.629 --> 02:02:34.639 align:start position:0%
don't you also though on the medical
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
side don't you have a really significant
 
02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
percentage of them
 
02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
that are also suffering to some extent
 
02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
dementia or alzheimer's
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
i i i tell you sir probably about 85
 
02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:48.310 align:start position:0%
i i i tell you sir probably about 85
percent

02:02:48.310 --> 02:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
of those who live here in total have
 
02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
some form
 
02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
of um diagnosis whether it's parkinson's
 
02:02:54.639 --> 02:02:55.430 align:start position:0%
of um diagnosis whether it's parkinson's
disease

02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
disease
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's or dementia if it has not
 
02:02:59.750 --> 02:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
progressed to the point where they
 
02:03:01.589 --> 02:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
are a wandering risk we would not put
 
02:03:03.910 --> 02:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
them on behind the closed doors
 
02:03:05.669 --> 02:03:05.679 align:start position:0%
and allow them to you know live in an
 
02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
environment that allows them
 
02:03:10.709 --> 02:03:10.719 align:start position:0%
the best use of their their own time
 
02:03:13.589 --> 02:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
again we would only put them on the life
 
02:03:14.950 --> 02:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
enhancement dimension if they were a
 
02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
wandering risk
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
or would benefit from that program
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
because the um the units are much
 
02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:21.830 align:start position:0%
because the um the units are much
smaller

02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
02:03:24.870 --> 02:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
and is much more
 
02:03:26.950 --> 02:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
i don't want to use the word quiet but
 
02:03:28.629 --> 02:03:28.639 align:start position:0%
uh not a lot
 
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
more of people coming and going in the
 
02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:32.310 align:start position:0%
more of people coming and going in the
areas

02:03:32.310 --> 02:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
areas
 
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
so they're less distracted with the
 
02:03:35.910 --> 02:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
stranger danger
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
i i brought that up because it's my
 
02:03:38.639 --> 02:03:39.910 align:start position:0%
i i brought that up because it's my
perception

02:03:39.910 --> 02:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
perception
 
02:03:42.870 --> 02:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
that the acuity of your residence is
 
02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:43.750 align:start position:0%
that the acuity of your residence is
actually

02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:03:45.910 --> 02:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
more intense than a typical county
 
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
nursing home
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
is that is that a bad assumption um i
 
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
believe that is a correct
 
02:03:54.149 --> 02:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
assumption we have um the co-morbidities
 
02:03:57.189 --> 02:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
of our residents who live here
 
02:03:58.709 --> 02:03:58.719 align:start position:0%
you know they could have six different
 
02:04:00.149 --> 02:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
co-morbidities whether they're living
 
02:04:00.159 --> 02:04:00.709 align:start position:0%
co-morbidities whether they're living
with

02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:04:04.229 --> 02:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
dementia copd again
 
02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
a resident who has parkinson's disease
 
02:04:08.629 --> 02:04:08.639 align:start position:0%
in relationship to
 
02:04:11.589 --> 02:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
whether it was agent orange or other um
 
02:04:13.109 --> 02:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
you know they just seem to
 
02:04:16.709 --> 02:04:16.719 align:start position:0%
be much more frail and again our average
 
02:04:19.270 --> 02:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
age is approximately 86 years old
 
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
so again they're um the population is
 
02:04:27.750 --> 02:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
how's that sir yep okay uh qualified
 
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
staffing as you can imagine
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
particularly in nursing um our lnas lpns
 
02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
and rns
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
is challenging has been challenging over
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
the years
 
02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
we know that this is not just a new
 
02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire veterans home challenge this
 
02:04:45.589 --> 02:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
is a challenge across the nation
 
02:04:48.629 --> 02:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
for people to have direct care staff
 
02:04:50.550 --> 02:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of our veterans who live
 
02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
here so we do have many vacancies
 
02:04:56.149 --> 02:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
that we will continue to recruit for and
 
02:04:57.510 --> 02:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
try to retain
 
02:05:01.189 --> 02:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
on those that require so that we can
 
02:05:01.199 --> 02:05:01.830 align:start position:0%
on those that require so that we can
require

02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
require
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me so that we're able to provide
 
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
the care that is needed um i will tell
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
you currently we have
 
02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
12 full-time lna positions across the
 
02:05:15.030 --> 02:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh first second and third shift eight
 
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
part-time lna positions that we're
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
currently um recruiting for
 
02:05:22.950 --> 02:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh two full-time two-part-time lpns
 
02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
which is licensed practical nurses
 
02:05:27.669 --> 02:05:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh we are looking for six full-time rns
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
which are registered nurses and two
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
part-time registered nurses again this
 
02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:32.870 align:start position:0%
part-time registered nurses again this
has

02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:05:34.470 --> 02:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
been the trend that we've had over the
 
02:05:36.390 --> 02:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
last couple of years and in prior
 
02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:37.510 align:start position:0%
last couple of years and in prior
bienniums

02:05:37.510 --> 02:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
bienniums
 
02:05:40.069 --> 02:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
where we are looking for um health care
 
02:05:40.079 --> 02:05:40.790 align:start position:0%
where we are looking for um health care
direct

02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
direct
 
02:05:44.310 --> 02:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
um providing staff again
 
02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
our our veterans are staying curious
 
02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:47.430 align:start position:0%
our our veterans are staying curious
about

02:05:47.430 --> 02:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:05:50.310 --> 02:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
what that does to your vacancy rate it
 
02:05:52.950 --> 02:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
feels to me like you've got a 20 to 30
 
02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate and i assume you compete
 
02:05:59.189 --> 02:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
geographically with the same nursing
 
02:05:59.199 --> 02:05:59.750 align:start position:0%
geographically with the same nursing
staff

02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
staff
 
02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
as glencliff does um we yes glencliff
 
02:06:05.910 --> 02:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
although much farther north of us it is
 
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
the 12 nursing homes that are really
 
02:06:09.430 --> 02:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
around the lakes region that we
 
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
compete with whether that's saint
 
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
francis home belknap county nursing home
 
02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
merrimack county nursing home is only
 
02:06:17.189 --> 02:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
about eight miles down the road from us
 
02:06:19.510 --> 02:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
so it's a lot of the time we do passive
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
hiring in other words we steal their
 
02:06:23.669 --> 02:06:23.679 align:start position:0%
staff and they steal our staff
 
02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
um and again that that goes in a
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
roundabout so the budget is projected
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
for 225
 
02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
but with my staffing levels today we'd
 
02:06:35.109 --> 02:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
be comfortable
 
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
um increasing our census to 175 or 180
 
02:06:40.870 --> 02:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
and really once those vacancies get
 
02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
filled we would feel comfortable
 
02:06:49.189 --> 02:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
i'll try not to interrupt you i just
 
02:06:52.709 --> 02:06:52.719 align:start position:0%
like i said i'm just
 
02:06:54.950 --> 02:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
i'm looking forward to where my bed is
 
02:06:56.229 --> 02:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm sure
 
02:06:57.990 --> 02:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
we've got a corner office all set for
 
02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.830 align:start position:0%
we've got a corner office all set for
you

02:06:59.830 --> 02:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:07:02.470 --> 02:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
um of course va regulations do mandate
 
02:07:03.990 --> 02:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
that qualified nursing staff be
 
02:07:06.149 --> 02:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
available on a daily basis and those are
 
02:07:06.159 --> 02:07:06.470 align:start position:0%
available on a daily basis and those are
our

02:07:06.470 --> 02:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
end positions and we do ensure that
 
02:07:11.430 --> 02:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
those positions are in-house um to meet
 
02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:11.990 align:start position:0%
those positions are in-house um to meet
that

02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
regulation i know that
 
02:07:16.870 --> 02:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
there could have been a question in
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
regards to
 
02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
the footnote and house bill 2 as well as
 
02:07:23.109 --> 02:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
you would see
 
02:07:26.470 --> 02:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
looking at our budget um the footnote
 
02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:07:29.390 --> 02:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
after our professional house which is
 
02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:30.950 align:start position:0%
after our professional house which is
5359

02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
5359
 
02:07:33.030 --> 02:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
on page 188 that talks about the
 
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
organizational notes
 
02:07:37.430 --> 02:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
those were also put in house bill 2. we
 
02:07:39.750 --> 02:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
have had those for many many years
 
02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
and that is directly related to the fact
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
that two of our funding sources
 
02:07:47.669 --> 02:07:47.679 align:start position:0%
are um based on solely on
 
02:07:50.229 --> 02:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
the census of the residents who reside
 
02:07:50.239 --> 02:07:51.030 align:start position:0%
the census of the residents who reside
here

02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:07:54.870 --> 02:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
um again the first the federal revenue
 
02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:57.679 align:start position:0%
is the per diem revenue that comes from
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
the va
 
02:08:03.030 --> 02:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
veterans affairs that gives us 115.62
 
02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
cents a day
 
02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
per resident who is actually in bed at
 
02:08:06.719 --> 02:08:07.109 align:start position:0%
per resident who is actually in bed at
11

02:08:07.109 --> 02:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
11
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
59 at night um and i kid you not when i
 
02:08:12.149 --> 02:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
tell you at 11 59 at night there was a
 
02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
count that's done
 
02:08:15.270 --> 02:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
and those numbers are verified with the
 
02:08:16.470 --> 02:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
manchester va
 
02:08:18.149 --> 02:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
and that is how we get our monthly per
 
02:08:18.159 --> 02:08:19.589 align:start position:0%
and that is how we get our monthly per
diem

02:08:19.589 --> 02:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
diem
 
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
so representative nordgren has a
 
02:08:23.430 --> 02:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
question and then
 
02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
i also have a question about which
 
02:08:28.149 --> 02:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
section of hb2 you're referring to
 
02:08:28.159 --> 02:08:28.870 align:start position:0%
section of hb2 you're referring to
because

02:08:28.870 --> 02:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
i thought i'd gotten to be very familiar
 
02:08:32.550 --> 02:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
with hb2
 
02:08:34.870 --> 02:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
and i don't i don't know which which
 
02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
section or paragraph
 
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
you're referring to sure on house bill 2
 
02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
number 47 which allows the new hampshire
 
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
veterans home to transfer funds within
 
02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
the accounting units
 
02:08:48.550 --> 02:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
if you look in the actual detail which
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:54.629 --> 02:08:54.639 align:start position:0%
106 which allows me to have unfunded
 
02:08:55.750 --> 02:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
position and move
 
02:08:58.390 --> 02:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
funds around that's directly related to
 
02:08:58.400 --> 02:08:59.990 align:start position:0%
funds around that's directly related to
staffing

02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
staffing
 
02:09:03.350 --> 02:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
as well as 107 but the um
 
02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
the footnote is 108 that talks about
 
02:09:09.669 --> 02:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
um if during the biennium projected
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
revenues are more
 
02:09:13.589 --> 02:09:13.599 align:start position:0%
i can go before fiscal and ask for those
 
02:09:16.390 --> 02:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
funds to be accepted
 
02:09:19.510 --> 02:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
and it also allows if it's less that my
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation will not be lowered
 
02:09:24.069 --> 02:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
because of those revenues not coming in
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
because they're directly related to the
 
02:09:25.679 --> 02:09:26.790 align:start position:0%
because they're directly related to the
census

02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
census
 
02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
and of course i can't increase the sense
 
02:09:29.830 --> 02:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
if i'm not able to fill
 
02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
the positions because i have to cut
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
positions because i don't have the
 
02:09:32.639 --> 02:09:35.750 align:start position:0%
positions because i don't have the
census

02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:37.510 --> 02:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your patience do you have
 
02:09:38.870 --> 02:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
a question
 
02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
yeah um i just wanted to know if your
 
02:09:44.550 --> 02:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
salaries were
 
02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
large enough so you were able to compete
 
02:09:49.750 --> 02:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
with the nursing homes i think that was
 
02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
an issue we had
 
02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
with glenn cliff and i wanted to make
 
02:09:56.790 --> 02:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
sure you had enough viability in your
 
02:10:00.069 --> 02:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
salary line to be able to hire people if
 
02:10:00.079 --> 02:10:01.189 align:start position:0%
salary line to be able to hire people if
available

02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:10:04.149 --> 02:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you ma'am for that question
 
02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
yes the new hampshire veterans home has
 
02:10:07.830 --> 02:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
gone before governor and council
 
02:10:09.830 --> 02:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of years and asked
 
02:10:11.910 --> 02:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
for an increase or an enhancement to our
 
02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:13.430 align:start position:0%
for an increase or an enhancement to our
nursing

02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
nursing
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
salaries in order to make us competitive
 
02:10:18.229 --> 02:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
so i do appreciate that
 
02:10:18.239 --> 02:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
so i do appreciate that
question

02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:19.330 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:10:19.330 --> 02:10:22.790 align:start position:0%
question
[Music]

02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:10:27.750 --> 02:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
so the second part of the per diem of
 
02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
course is those um veterans who are 70
 
02:10:32.790 --> 02:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
to 100
 
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
service connected and the new hampshire
 
02:10:39.229 --> 02:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
453.84 for
 
02:10:44.229 --> 02:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
a service connected veteran to live at
 
02:10:46.149 --> 02:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
the home and that does pay for the total
 
02:10:46.159 --> 02:10:47.350 align:start position:0%
the home and that does pay for the total
cost

02:10:47.350 --> 02:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
cost
 
02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
in that mou with the veterans
 
02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:50.470 align:start position:0%
in that mou with the veterans
administration

02:10:50.470 --> 02:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
administration
 
02:10:52.629 --> 02:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
if we are accepting the higher per diem
 
02:10:53.990 --> 02:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
we are not allowed
 
02:10:56.550 --> 02:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
to charge room and board to that
 
02:10:57.990 --> 02:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
resident because it covers
 
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
the total cost of care um and speaking
 
02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:11:03.189 --> 02:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
room and board is the next one the
 
02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
agency income is based solely again
 
02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
on resident census we we look at each
 
02:11:10.069 --> 02:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
one of our residents separately
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
based on their
 
02:11:17.589 --> 02:11:17.599 align:start position:0%
their income if their income
 
02:11:19.830 --> 02:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
or excuse me if their assets are above a
 
02:11:20.709 --> 02:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
certain level
 
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
they are charged a full room and board
 
02:11:24.870 --> 02:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
until their assets are below
 
02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
um the level that is under our
 
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
 
02:11:31.109 --> 02:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
which allows uh once they're it's under
 
02:11:32.069 --> 02:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
its 90
 
02:11:35.189 --> 02:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
of their income if their assets are
 
02:11:36.069 --> 02:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
above 30
 
02:11:39.510 --> 02:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
000 then they are charged 320 a day
 
02:11:41.189 --> 02:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
which is the average that's being
 
02:11:43.030 --> 02:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
charged um throughout the lakes region
 
02:11:44.709 --> 02:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
area so we try to
 
02:11:47.830 --> 02:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that and quite honestly if you
 
02:11:49.669 --> 02:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
take the 320
 
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
plus the per diem of 115 that is our
 
02:11:53.990 --> 02:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
total cost of our care
 
02:11:55.750 --> 02:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
so we feel that we shouldn't be charging
 
02:11:57.030 --> 02:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
our residents any more
 
02:11:59.160 --> 02:11:59.170 align:start position:0%
than what it cost us to care for them
 
02:11:59.170 --> 02:12:01.350 align:start position:0%
than what it cost us to care for them
[Music]

02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:12:03.430 --> 02:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
any questions on per diem or room and
 
02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:04.629 align:start position:0%
any questions on per diem or room and
board

02:12:04.629 --> 02:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:12:06.470 --> 02:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
and again those are laid out um through
 
02:12:10.950 --> 02:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
of course we have a slide slide deck
 
02:12:14.709 --> 02:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
you're going to walk us through did
 
02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
mr ripple did you send something earlier
 
02:12:18.069 --> 02:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
on veterans home
 
02:12:19.990 --> 02:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
i only had the verbal presentation shirt
 
02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
so you did not have a powerpoint
 
02:12:27.430 --> 02:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay um the third
 
02:12:29.109 --> 02:12:29.119 align:start position:0%
funding source of course is fed uh
 
02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
general funds and so we would
 
02:12:34.629 --> 02:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
again ask that we be allowed the
 
02:12:35.910 --> 02:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
footnotes that are
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
after our budget
 
02:12:41.910 --> 02:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
to allow us to um continue with our
 
02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:42.790 align:start position:0%
to allow us to um continue with our
census

02:12:42.790 --> 02:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
census
 
02:12:45.589 --> 02:12:45.599 align:start position:0%
um and increasing that census as we go
 
02:12:50.790 --> 02:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:53.750 --> 02:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
the other upcoming needs of the new
 
02:12:55.510 --> 02:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire veterans home of course is new
 
02:12:57.030 --> 02:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
and replacement equipments whether
 
02:12:57.040 --> 02:12:57.589 align:start position:0%
and replacement equipments whether
that's

02:12:57.589 --> 02:12:57.599 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:13:00.629 --> 02:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
beds or overhead lifts
 
02:13:02.790 --> 02:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
and obviously those overhead lifts are
 
02:13:04.229 --> 02:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
because of the greater care needs of our
 
02:13:04.239 --> 02:13:06.390 align:start position:0%
because of the greater care needs of our
veterans

02:13:06.390 --> 02:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
the challenges that we see ahead are
 
02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
women health care
 
02:13:13.750 --> 02:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
bariatric care hospice care dementia
 
02:13:15.669 --> 02:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
with behavioral disturbances
 
02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
and we do see an increase in our vietnam
 
02:13:19.350 --> 02:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
veterans being admitted to the new
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire veterans home
 
02:13:24.229 --> 02:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
so so it i think it's fine that you
 
02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
don't have power points
 
02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know how you have veterans
 
02:13:31.830 --> 02:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
around you and not do powerpoint but
 
02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's sort of an inside joke but if we
 
02:13:35.990 --> 02:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
could maybe we could
 
02:13:40.229 --> 02:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
visualize using the spreadsheets
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
so if we could go maybe share the
 
02:13:42.239 --> 02:13:43.750 align:start position:0%
so if we could go maybe share the
veterans

02:13:43.750 --> 02:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
02:13:47.030 --> 02:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and in some of the points
 
02:13:49.109 --> 02:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
that you're making may be related to an
 
02:13:51.750 --> 02:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
income line or an expense line
 
02:13:55.350 --> 02:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
and we could use the visual or visual
 
02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
ability and our hearing ability together
 
02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely um kevin are you going to
 
02:14:03.030 --> 02:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
bring up the new hampshire veterans home
 
02:14:04.950 --> 02:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's 1186 is the
 
02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
professional um
 
02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:16.870 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:26.229 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:14:26.229 --> 02:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:28.390 --> 02:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
and next time uh representative i'll
 
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
make sure i have a powerpoint
 
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
presentation for you
 
02:14:32.550 --> 02:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
at least one with your name on it that
 
02:14:34.470 --> 02:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
way you know you can put the check in
 
02:14:35.189 --> 02:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
the box
 
02:14:37.589 --> 02:14:37.599 align:start position:0%
okay sorry it's taking me just a second
 
02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
to find it here
 
02:14:41.189 --> 02:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
so so while he's doing that i have a
 
02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
trivia question for you you said
 
02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
that you get a higher reimbursement rate
 
02:14:47.669 --> 02:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
for people with a 70
 
02:14:50.550 --> 02:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
disability i'm i'm one of those people
 
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
that have
 
02:14:54.069 --> 02:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
like a 90 disability that they've
 
02:14:56.470 --> 02:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
adjusted down to 70 percent
 
02:14:58.629 --> 02:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
and a big part of my disability is
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
related to
 
02:15:03.589 --> 02:15:03.599 align:start position:0%
sleep apnea would would
 
02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
are there other rules that would keep me
 
02:15:08.069 --> 02:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
from qualifying
 
02:15:12.470 --> 02:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
in that 70 to 100 disability level
 
02:15:15.830 --> 02:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
no sir um you would at any veteran who
 
02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
has 70 to 100
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
service connected disability comes and
 
02:15:21.350 --> 02:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
lives at the new hampshire veterans home
 
02:15:23.830 --> 02:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
free of charge from their income and is
 
02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
paid for in total
 
02:15:27.990 --> 02:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
by the veterans administration um the
 
02:15:29.589 --> 02:15:29.599 align:start position:0%
only thing that would keep you out is if
 
02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
you were a danger to others
 
02:15:34.069 --> 02:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
if you were violent um and or we were
 
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
unable to meet your
 
02:15:46.629 --> 02:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:49.669 --> 02:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
sorry one one moment here is a
 
02:15:53.109 --> 02:15:53.119 align:start position:0%
it starts out on um kevin ours starts at
 
02:15:56.629 --> 02:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
page 1185 halfway on the page it starts
 
02:15:58.550 --> 02:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
on our custodial care
 
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
and again 11 85. yeah
 
02:16:08.310 --> 02:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
about halfway down you'll see new
 
02:16:10.069 --> 02:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire veterans home and that's the
 
02:16:14.229 --> 02:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
veterans home custodial care 5358
 
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
is all of those positions at the new
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire veterans home
 
02:16:21.189 --> 02:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
that are not direct care so they could
 
02:16:21.199 --> 02:16:22.149 align:start position:0%
that are not direct care so they could
be

02:16:22.149 --> 02:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:16:25.669 --> 02:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
laundry workers environmental services
 
02:16:27.430 --> 02:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
which is our housekeepers
 
02:16:32.549 --> 02:16:32.559 align:start position:0%
our maintenance crew
 
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
and again that part of the budget is a
 
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
hundred percent
 
02:16:38.469 --> 02:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
general funds and that's a little over
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
eight million
 
02:16:41.669 --> 02:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
in the first biennium and eight point
 
02:16:41.679 --> 02:16:42.549 align:start position:0%
in the first biennium and eight point
three

02:16:42.549 --> 02:16:42.559 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:16:45.990 --> 02:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
um in 23. what's your head
 
02:16:47.990 --> 02:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
count for that could you scroll down a
 
02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
little bit that's 94
 
02:16:52.309 --> 02:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
um full-time positions sir okay how are
 
02:16:53.589 --> 02:16:53.599 align:start position:0%
you doing on vacancies
 
02:16:56.469 --> 02:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
here in this in this kind of actually we
 
02:16:56.479 --> 02:16:56.790 align:start position:0%
here in this in this kind of actually we
do

02:16:56.790 --> 02:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
we do have vacancies um again hit or
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
miss whether there's retirees and
 
02:17:02.309 --> 02:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
housekeeping and laundry in our
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
maintenance guys
 
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
um we we do have a hard time uh
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
getting people to work second and third
 
02:17:10.389 --> 02:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
shift in maintenance
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
and housekeeping uh so those are you
 
02:17:13.669 --> 02:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
know we
 
02:17:16.870 --> 02:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
probably we have a 25 um turnover
 
02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
in those positions it seems that we you
 
02:17:20.469 --> 02:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
know we get them filled
 
02:17:23.669 --> 02:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
but again um night shift is
 
02:17:26.870 --> 02:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
is not for everyone so we we try hard to
 
02:17:28.549 --> 02:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
as people stay on that shift if a
 
02:17:30.389 --> 02:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
daytime vacancy occurs
 
02:17:32.309 --> 02:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of them will apply for those and
 
02:17:33.750 --> 02:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
so then we're again
 
02:17:35.190 --> 02:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
filling second and third shift
 
02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:37.429 align:start position:0%
filling second and third shift
[Music]

02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:17:39.270 --> 02:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
okay what do you think accounted for
 
02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
your general funds jumping from 7.3
 
02:17:45.589 --> 02:17:45.599 align:start position:0%
million and 20 to 8.8 and 21.
 
02:17:47.830 --> 02:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
again it's those vacancies and turnover
 
02:17:48.629 --> 02:17:48.639 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:17:50.469 --> 02:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
people who retire and the position gets
 
02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
left open for a period of time
 
02:17:56.070 --> 02:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
um in 22 and 23
 
02:17:57.990 --> 02:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
is is showing the full vacancy of those
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
positions but in 20
 
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
you see the amount go down because the
 
02:18:04.150 --> 02:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
positions were not always filled
 
02:18:06.870 --> 02:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i understand so you're you're
 
02:18:08.629 --> 02:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
probably going to have another
 
02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
decrease because of the hiring lag
 
02:18:14.870 --> 02:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
really yes yes sir it certainly is a
 
02:18:15.589 --> 02:18:15.599 align:start position:0%
challenge and
 
02:18:17.750 --> 02:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
dietary is another one of the positions
 
02:18:19.509 --> 02:18:19.519 align:start position:0%
there where we have a you know
 
02:18:21.030 --> 02:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
constantly looking for dietary
 
02:18:23.110 --> 02:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
physicians um and so
 
02:18:25.110 --> 02:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
again we don't spend it if we don't you
 
02:18:27.270 --> 02:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
know if the position is vacant
 
02:18:29.190 --> 02:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
then the money does not get spent but
 
02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
again we we do ask that if
 
02:18:33.910 --> 02:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
it be fully funded so that we're able to
 
02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh recruit into those positions
 
02:18:38.709 --> 02:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
right where is the money that you're
 
02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
spending from that
 
02:18:43.349 --> 02:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
personnel line when you go and just
 
02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
contract with a maintenance company or
 
02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:46.870 align:start position:0%
contract with a maintenance company or
something

02:18:46.870 --> 02:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
um we have um a snow plowing contract
 
02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
as you see if you look over um to 103
 
02:18:55.030 --> 02:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
contract for
 
02:18:57.589 --> 02:18:57.599 align:start position:0%
operations services that's the contract
 
02:18:59.509 --> 02:18:59.519 align:start position:0%
they do snow plowing for us
 
02:19:01.589 --> 02:19:01.599 align:start position:0%
we do not contract for any maintenance
 
02:19:01.599 --> 02:19:02.790 align:start position:0%
we do not contract for any maintenance
housekeeping

02:19:02.790 --> 02:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
housekeeping
 
02:19:06.629 --> 02:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
and or laundry at this time
 
02:19:10.389 --> 02:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
they are positions funded very good
 
02:19:12.790 --> 02:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
i i i don't are there any questions in
 
02:19:14.549 --> 02:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
this area
 
02:19:18.389 --> 02:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
for the commandant we can go on
 
02:19:21.429 --> 02:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
so 5359 is the professional care this
 
02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
one obviously is much more detail and
 
02:19:24.629 --> 02:19:24.639 align:start position:0%
this is broken down
 
02:19:27.349 --> 02:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
shows you the federal per diem um as
 
02:19:29.190 --> 02:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
well as the room and boards that is
 
02:19:30.950 --> 02:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
charged to our veterans
 
02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
um again you will see the actual expense
 
02:19:36.549 --> 02:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
in 2020 for our personal services was
 
02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
11.5 million
 
02:19:40.389 --> 02:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
we are asking for our positions to be
 
02:19:41.429 --> 02:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
fully funded
 
02:19:43.589 --> 02:19:43.599 align:start position:0%
so that we are able to recruit actively
 
02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:45.599 align:start position:0%
recruit for those positions
 
02:19:48.070 --> 02:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
um but again if the positions are not
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
filled um that money does lapse back
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
to general funds uh excuse me lapse back
 
02:19:53.670 --> 02:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
to the fund
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
um as it is allocated below
 
02:20:00.230 --> 02:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
um the reason again why we ask that we
 
02:20:02.550 --> 02:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
are allowed the transfer between
 
02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
we do have an outside contract with an
 
02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:05.750 align:start position:0%
we do have an outside contract with an
agency

02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
agency
 
02:20:07.349 --> 02:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
temporary agency for direct care
 
02:20:07.359 --> 02:20:09.590 align:start position:0%
temporary agency for direct care
physicians

02:20:09.590 --> 02:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
physicians
 
02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
we have not had a lot of success with
 
02:20:13.590 --> 02:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
that but we have had
 
02:20:16.469 --> 02:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
a couple of nurses and a couple of lnas
 
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
from that and as you can see
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
if you look at 101 medical payments to
 
02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:21.750 align:start position:0%
if you look at 101 medical payments to
providers

02:20:21.750 --> 02:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
providers
 
02:20:24.870 --> 02:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
the 242 thousand dollars and change that
 
02:20:26.790 --> 02:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
was expended in 2020
 
02:20:29.910 --> 02:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
that represents a couple of rns and lnas
 
02:20:31.590 --> 02:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
that helped us out
 
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
again we only spend it if we need it
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
and so we are able to transfer between
 
02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
that line
 
02:20:41.830 --> 02:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
and um our temporary uh services are
 
02:20:43.110 --> 02:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:20:46.550 --> 02:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
class 10 and class 101 so that
 
02:20:48.389 --> 02:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
if we're able to get a full-time person
 
02:20:50.230 --> 02:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
that's always what we want to do we want
 
02:20:51.990 --> 02:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
somebody with consistent care to our
 
02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:53.030 align:start position:0%
somebody with consistent care to our
veterans

02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
02:20:54.790 --> 02:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
um but in the knee if the need is there
 
02:20:56.469 --> 02:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
and the agency has somebody
 
02:20:58.950 --> 02:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
that they can offer to us we want to be
 
02:20:59.590 --> 02:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:21:03.510 --> 02:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
um expend that out of class 101.
 
02:21:07.110 --> 02:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
again that is it tell me about 0-2-1
 
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
food institutions institutional food
 
02:21:10.560 --> 02:21:10.950 align:start position:0%

02:21:10.950 --> 02:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:21:13.990 --> 02:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
um and that is exactly what it um states
 
02:21:14.950 --> 02:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
that's the um
 
02:21:18.070 --> 02:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
that's our dietary budget um and for the
 
02:21:19.990 --> 02:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
foods whether it's uh
 
02:21:22.309 --> 02:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh steak or hot dogs hot dogs and beans
 
02:21:24.070 --> 02:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
is a saturday favorite
 
02:21:27.910 --> 02:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh pasta um or some other kind of uh
 
02:21:30.630 --> 02:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
spaghetti on wednesdays so that is
 
02:21:30.640 --> 02:21:31.750 align:start position:0%
spaghetti on wednesdays so that is
solely

02:21:31.750 --> 02:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
solely
 
02:21:35.110 --> 02:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
food uh institutional food line
 
02:21:38.309 --> 02:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
for your nutritionists and cooks
 
02:21:41.190 --> 02:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
in this they're in this their payroll is
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
in here
 
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
their payroll would be under class 10.
 
02:21:47.349 --> 02:21:47.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so i have um two dietitians
 
02:21:49.590 --> 02:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
i have a dietitian's assistant we have
 
02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
somebody that's constantly monitoring
 
02:21:54.790 --> 02:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
our residents to make sure that um that
 
02:21:56.469 --> 02:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
they're meeting their caloric
 
02:21:59.190 --> 02:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
intake um and offering uh different
 
02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
protein shakes or drinks
 
02:22:03.349 --> 02:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
if their weight dips below a certain
 
02:22:03.359 --> 02:22:05.590 align:start position:0%
if their weight dips below a certain
percentage

02:22:05.590 --> 02:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
so so show us the personnel line if you
 
02:22:08.640 --> 02:22:09.349 align:start position:0%
so so show us the personnel line if you
would

02:22:09.349 --> 02:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:22:12.870 --> 02:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
mr ripple class 10 sir oh the
 
02:22:15.190 --> 02:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
number the number of humans oh the
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
number of humans is um
 
02:22:20.710 --> 02:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry 289 uh full-time
 
02:22:23.490 --> 02:22:23.500 align:start position:0%
and one unclassified and that is myself
 
02:22:23.500 --> 02:22:25.110 align:start position:0%
and one unclassified and that is myself
[Music]

02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:22:27.030 --> 02:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
so again we have um currently we are
 
02:22:28.550 --> 02:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
actively recruiting
 
02:22:31.349 --> 02:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
for 32 vacancies in that line although
 
02:22:31.990 --> 02:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:38.309 --> 02:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
that are vacant at this time um i don't
 
02:22:41.510 --> 02:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
know right off the top of my head the
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
ones that are um totally filled because
 
02:22:45.510 --> 02:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
we always have a little bit of influx
 
02:22:48.150 --> 02:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
between the two
 
02:22:53.110 --> 02:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:55.830 --> 02:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
not i'm not seeing any and then here's
 
02:22:55.840 --> 02:22:56.550 align:start position:0%
not i'm not seeing any and then here's
where

02:22:56.550 --> 02:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:22:58.230 --> 02:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
you want to draw our attention i think
 
02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
to the organization note
 
02:23:02.710 --> 02:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
yes this is the footnote that i feel is
 
02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
very important that the home has
 
02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
so that we're able to actively recruit
 
02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
um even when our census is low
 
02:23:11.349 --> 02:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
um i think that we need to be able to
 
02:23:13.429 --> 02:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
actively recruit and um
 
02:23:17.190 --> 02:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
if based on our census our census
 
02:23:17.200 --> 02:23:17.990 align:start position:0%
if based on our census our census
obviously

02:23:17.990 --> 02:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
02:23:20.070 --> 02:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
due to the devastation of covet 19 our
 
02:23:21.670 --> 02:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
census is lower
 
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
than it would normally be we were unable
 
02:23:25.110 --> 02:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
to do admissions
 
02:23:27.670 --> 02:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
most of last year we are starting our
 
02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:28.550 align:start position:0%
most of last year we are starting our
admissions

02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
admissions
 
02:23:31.030 --> 02:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
on march 30th so we're hoping to get
 
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
more veterans um in the home
 
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
but if if if we would if we were to
 
02:23:39.990 --> 02:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
lose our appropriation based on the fact
 
02:23:41.670 --> 02:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
that our census was down
 
02:23:43.830 --> 02:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
um we would have a hard time paying
 
02:23:46.230 --> 02:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
those bills okay
 
02:23:47.910 --> 02:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to talk to the committee
 
02:23:49.270 --> 02:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
members a second
 
02:23:52.389 --> 02:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh i i i had not
 
02:23:56.150 --> 02:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
um anticipated us going through the
 
02:23:57.990 --> 02:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
organization notes the footnotes and
 
02:24:00.469 --> 02:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
having separate votes on them to make
 
02:24:02.710 --> 02:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
sure that we're okay with them
 
02:24:06.150 --> 02:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh and and and because of that
 
02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh i'd like to to just ask
 
02:24:13.349 --> 02:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
if there is a committee member now
 
02:24:15.429 --> 02:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
who has a problem with this
 
02:24:17.030 --> 02:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
organizational mode
 
02:24:19.910 --> 02:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
because if if we don't have if no one
 
02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
has a problem with it
 
02:24:24.309 --> 02:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just have us all assume that
 
02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
this is an
 
02:24:27.750 --> 02:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
acceptable organizational note and move
 
02:24:27.760 --> 02:24:29.429 align:start position:0%
acceptable organizational note and move
on

02:24:29.429 --> 02:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
so so think about it uh representative
 
02:24:32.399 --> 02:24:33.349 align:start position:0%
so so think about it uh representative
irf

02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
irf
 
02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
so i don't have a problem with it but i
 
02:24:36.710 --> 02:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
if i'm not mistaken it is actually one
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:24:40.469 --> 02:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
hb2 numbers i guess number 107 isn't
 
02:24:42.870 --> 02:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
that what you said coming on
 
02:24:47.110 --> 02:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
you said 47 what one zero seven 107
 
02:24:48.550 --> 02:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
so i believe we'll be considering i mean
 
02:24:50.070 --> 02:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
i agree with it but i think we'll be
 
02:24:51.110 --> 02:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
considering when we go
 
02:24:52.710 --> 02:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
through hb2 there's i think there are
 
02:24:52.720 --> 02:24:54.469 align:start position:0%
through hb2 there's i think there are
three

02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:24:57.830 --> 02:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh veterans items in there number 106
 
02:25:00.230 --> 02:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
number 107 and number 108 coming down is
 
02:25:01.349 --> 02:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:07.830 --> 02:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
okay so those aren't on my radar as hb2
 
02:25:11.429 --> 02:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
items well you may recall just yesterday
 
02:25:13.190 --> 02:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
when we were going through it
 
02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
somebody brought up jumping ahead and
 
02:25:16.870 --> 02:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
you said well we're just doing dhhs and
 
02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
that was
 
02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
the jumping head was to the veterans the
 
02:25:21.110 --> 02:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
three veterans oh
 
02:25:23.510 --> 02:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's why i don't know these hp2s
 
02:25:24.790 --> 02:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
because we haven't looked at the
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
veterans yet
 
02:25:29.429 --> 02:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
correct oh so we will have to
 
02:25:32.870 --> 02:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
schedule a discussion and vote on these
 
02:25:34.230 --> 02:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
all right well you can do it as you
 
02:25:35.349 --> 02:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
please but i just want to point out to
 
02:25:38.790 --> 02:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
them no no no no no i i once we've got a
 
02:25:40.870 --> 02:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
process let's use the process i
 
02:25:44.309 --> 02:25:44.319 align:start position:0%
i just thought for some reason that
 
02:25:46.950 --> 02:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
that i knew all our hp twos and i'd
 
02:25:49.190 --> 02:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
overlooked these
 
02:25:52.309 --> 02:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
okay um all right
 
02:25:55.110 --> 02:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
well uh so we will be talking about
 
02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
these later
 
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
and uh getting a vote on them i'm not
 
02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
seeing anyone disputing it though so it
 
02:26:00.950 --> 02:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
02:26:05.670 --> 02:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
an issue um all right uh we can go on
 
02:26:08.790 --> 02:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
sure so 5360 is our pharmacy services
 
02:26:10.230 --> 02:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
and they are exactly
 
02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
um what they proclaim to be we do have
 
02:26:13.670 --> 02:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
um a
 
02:26:15.750 --> 02:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
contract with consultants um that uh
 
02:26:17.110 --> 02:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
provide us with pharmacists and
 
02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:17.990 align:start position:0%
provide us with pharmacists and
pharmacists

02:26:17.990 --> 02:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacists
 
02:26:19.830 --> 02:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
technicians as you can see that's under
 
02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:21.190 align:start position:0%
technicians as you can see that's under
046

02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
046
 
02:26:23.750 --> 02:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
for consultants and the rest is exactly
 
02:26:25.270 --> 02:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
what it is it's prescription drug
 
02:26:25.280 --> 02:26:26.389 align:start position:0%
what it is it's prescription drug
expenses

02:26:26.389 --> 02:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
02:26:30.469 --> 02:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
we do use the mckesson which is the va's
 
02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
formulary and we get um i believe a
 
02:26:34.309 --> 02:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
great rate
 
02:26:37.510 --> 02:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
um for our pharmaceuticals again um
 
02:26:39.670 --> 02:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
as you can see in 2020 with our census
 
02:26:40.550 --> 02:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
was down
 
02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
we just uh spent under a little bit
 
02:26:45.510 --> 02:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
under 560 000
 
02:26:48.550 --> 02:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
we are asking um going forward for 800
 
02:26:50.389 --> 02:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
000 to make sure that we're able to meet
 
02:26:53.030 --> 02:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
the needs of the census as it gets
 
02:26:56.070 --> 02:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
as it increases the consultant again the
 
02:26:58.630 --> 02:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
consultant line is exactly that
 
02:27:00.630 --> 02:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
what was approved through governor and
 
02:27:03.349 --> 02:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
council contract
 
02:27:05.910 --> 02:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
so so if you have a veteran who's living
 
02:27:06.870 --> 02:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
at home
 
02:27:08.710 --> 02:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
and they're receiving mail order
 
02:27:09.990 --> 02:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
prescriptions from
 
02:27:12.950 --> 02:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
the va pharmacy then they become a
 
02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:13.990 align:start position:0%
the va pharmacy then they become a
resident

02:27:13.990 --> 02:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
resident
 
02:27:17.270 --> 02:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
in your home um do they
 
02:27:20.309 --> 02:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
do they still draw their
 
02:27:23.590 --> 02:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
mail order or do you halt that somehow
 
02:27:24.150 --> 02:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
and you
 
02:27:27.429 --> 02:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
divert it into this program so we alert
 
02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
the formulary or the va that they are
 
02:27:31.270 --> 02:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
moving to the new hampshire veterans
 
02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:31.910 align:start position:0%
moving to the new hampshire veterans
home

02:27:31.910 --> 02:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
home
 
02:27:35.270 --> 02:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
so they would no longer
 
02:27:37.349 --> 02:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
would be receiving it via mail they
 
02:27:39.030 --> 02:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
would receive it from our pharmacy
 
02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
here at the new hampshire veterans home
 
02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
and we would ask for our reimbursement
 
02:27:45.270 --> 02:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
through our internal process if they are
 
02:27:47.110 --> 02:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
70 to 100 percent
 
02:27:50.070 --> 02:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
then in that per diem rate is included
 
02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:50.550 align:start position:0%
then in that per diem rate is included
the

02:27:50.550 --> 02:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:27:54.389 --> 02:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
cost of pharmaceuticals okay
 
02:27:58.950 --> 02:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
um so i'm just a little confused why the
 
02:28:02.070 --> 02:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
line 100 prescription drug expenses
 
02:28:05.510 --> 02:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
is so high because i'm i'm thinking
 
02:28:08.230 --> 02:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
if the va is just paying for them that
 
02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
that line would be near zero
 
02:28:13.349 --> 02:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
i know sir um most of the veterans who
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
live with us
 
02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
are are of different category lines and
 
02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:17.510 align:start position:0%
are are of different category lines and
so

02:28:17.510 --> 02:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:19.429 --> 02:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
only certain service-connected drugs are
 
02:28:21.670 --> 02:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
covered not all of the drugs that they
 
02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:22.710 align:start position:0%
covered not all of the drugs that they
have

02:28:22.710 --> 02:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
um the service connected are are
 
02:28:26.550 --> 02:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
different than 70 to 100 percent
 
02:28:29.190 --> 02:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
but again um i only have a handful of
 
02:28:31.429 --> 02:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
those who are 70 to 100 percent
 
02:28:34.950 --> 02:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
based on my overall population okay
 
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
good explanation thank you do you want
 
02:28:39.750 --> 02:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
to do you want to talk about this
 
02:28:41.910 --> 02:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
organization now or have we already
 
02:28:42.870 --> 02:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
talked about this
 
02:28:44.950 --> 02:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's the exact same note that resides
 
02:28:46.469 --> 02:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
under five three five nine
 
02:28:48.630 --> 02:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
it just allows uh for the a total
 
02:28:50.230 --> 02:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation to remain
 
02:28:53.510 --> 02:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
um if the amount of reimbursements go
 
02:28:55.750 --> 02:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
down based on the service connected
 
02:28:57.910 --> 02:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
or the the veterans who are not service
 
02:28:59.100 --> 02:28:59.110 align:start position:0%
connected i would say
 
02:28:59.110 --> 02:29:02.150 align:start position:0%
connected i would say
[Music]

02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
sure the next one is 8147 which is
 
02:29:06.309 --> 02:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
workers compensation
 
02:29:07.830 --> 02:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
which we do not have a whole lot of
 
02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
control over as you can imagine
 
02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
um and so those numbers are based on um
 
02:29:15.670 --> 02:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
what we feel has happened in the past
 
02:29:17.349 --> 02:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
and so we're just rolling those forwards
 
02:29:18.469 --> 02:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
pretty flat
 
02:29:22.309 --> 02:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
numbers right
 
02:29:26.150 --> 02:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh the next is um 6162
 
02:29:29.110 --> 02:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation again a very
 
02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:29.590 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation again a very
small

02:29:29.590 --> 02:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
small
 
02:29:32.180 --> 02:29:32.190 align:start position:0%
lines and those are 100 general funds
 
02:29:32.190 --> 02:29:33.830 align:start position:0%
lines and those are 100 general funds
[Music]

02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
a little over 18 thousand
 
02:29:39.190 --> 02:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
and that takes us to the end of the new
 
02:29:40.790 --> 02:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire veterans home and as you can
 
02:29:40.800 --> 02:29:41.429 align:start position:0%
hampshire veterans home and as you can
see

02:29:41.429 --> 02:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:29:44.469 --> 02:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
we have um 383 full-time
 
02:29:46.870 --> 02:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
um equivalents as one unclassified and
 
02:29:48.309 --> 02:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what we've asked for
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
all right so let me let me ask you a
 
02:29:54.720 --> 02:29:55.590 align:start position:0%
all right so let me let me ask you a
question

02:29:55.590 --> 02:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:29:59.349 --> 02:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
and and and and tell you in advance
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
i really just want a yes or no answer
 
02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
not not a not a long answer just a yes
 
02:30:07.990 --> 02:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
or no
 
02:30:11.030 --> 02:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
um we had a number
 
02:30:14.150 --> 02:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
of of deaths due to covid in the
 
02:30:17.349 --> 02:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:20.790 --> 02:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
have have you and your staff completed
 
02:30:24.790 --> 02:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
an internal review and come to identity
 
02:30:28.710 --> 02:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
identify the causes
 
02:30:30.469 --> 02:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
that may have contributed or the
 
02:30:32.790 --> 02:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
potential contributing causes
 
02:30:37.030 --> 02:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
and have you taken the remediation steps
 
02:30:40.550 --> 02:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
necessary to deal with those causes
 
02:30:45.429 --> 02:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
yes yes do you need
 
02:30:48.389 --> 02:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
is there any additional program
 
02:30:48.399 --> 02:30:49.510 align:start position:0%
is there any additional program
equipment

02:30:49.510 --> 02:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
02:30:53.110 --> 02:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
supply that that you would need
 
02:30:56.150 --> 02:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
to keep your remediation efforts in
 
02:30:56.160 --> 02:30:57.590 align:start position:0%
to keep your remediation efforts in
place

02:30:57.590 --> 02:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:30:59.590 --> 02:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
i feel that we've um that is in our
 
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
budget for 22 and 23 go and we're in
 
02:31:03.380 --> 02:31:03.390 align:start position:0%
good shape going forward
 
02:31:03.390 --> 02:31:04.870 align:start position:0%
good shape going forward
[Music]

02:31:04.870 --> 02:31:04.880 align:start position:0%

no sir we're totally paid up on all of
 
02:31:20.870 --> 02:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
our bills and our accounts payable lines
 
02:31:24.469 --> 02:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:28.950 --> 02:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions here
 
02:31:32.790 --> 02:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
02:31:35.750 --> 02:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
so that's that's really it commandant i
 
02:31:37.910 --> 02:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
oh i do have another trivia question for
 
02:31:37.920 --> 02:31:38.950 align:start position:0%
oh i do have another trivia question for
you

02:31:38.950 --> 02:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:31:43.270 --> 02:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
um okay about
 
02:31:46.469 --> 02:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
six months or so ago uh i had
 
02:31:50.070 --> 02:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
a roundabout uh complaint forwarded to
 
02:31:51.190 --> 02:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
me by one of your
 
02:31:53.349 --> 02:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
residents that originated with one of
 
02:31:54.950 --> 02:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
your residents
 
02:31:59.270 --> 02:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
and it was related to the idea that
 
02:32:01.510 --> 02:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
because of the way that wi-fi was
 
02:32:04.070 --> 02:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
provided inside the building
 
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
that all of the residents who had
 
02:32:11.270 --> 02:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
internet accounts needed to go directly
 
02:32:13.670 --> 02:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
to their own commercial providers of the
 
02:32:13.680 --> 02:32:14.950 align:start position:0%
to their own commercial providers of the
internet

02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
internet
 
02:32:18.070 --> 02:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
and that created a lot of contention
 
02:32:21.990 --> 02:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
and network problems for them
 
02:32:25.030 --> 02:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion with doit
 
02:32:28.309 --> 02:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
of expanding the government side
 
02:32:32.230 --> 02:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
of the wi-fi and segregate segmenting it
 
02:32:36.070 --> 02:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
so that the residents
 
02:32:38.150 --> 02:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
could use a single point of access
 
02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
instead of having to go
 
02:32:43.110 --> 02:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
for their own commercial version
 
02:32:46.950 --> 02:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
i i understand that a decision was made
 
02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
to require the residents to to continue
 
02:32:51.510 --> 02:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
getting their own
 
02:32:55.190 --> 02:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
commercial carrier for internet service
 
02:32:59.190 --> 02:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
instead of expanding the state network
 
02:33:01.910 --> 02:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
do you do you remember this do you have
 
02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:02.950 align:start position:0%
do you do you remember this do you have
anything

02:33:02.950 --> 02:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
anything
 
02:33:05.590 --> 02:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
i do sir and um after you had reached
 
02:33:07.990 --> 02:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
out to me i reached out to doit
 
02:33:09.990 --> 02:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
and asked them to explain to me in
 
02:33:13.830 --> 02:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
detail exactly what they were offering
 
02:33:15.750 --> 02:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
because we had had such a hard time at
 
02:33:17.590 --> 02:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
the home even getting a commercial
 
02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
provider to come in
 
02:33:22.550 --> 02:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
with the concrete walls
 
02:33:24.389 --> 02:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
as the home has been built and the
 
02:33:26.469 --> 02:33:26.479 align:start position:0%
different dark spots that we have around
 
02:33:28.630 --> 02:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
the building
 
02:33:31.750 --> 02:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
and i
 
02:33:34.070 --> 02:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
apologize i don't remember their exact
 
02:33:34.080 --> 02:33:35.429 align:start position:0%
apologize i don't remember their exact
response

02:33:35.429 --> 02:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
response
 
02:33:37.990 --> 02:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
but someone had reached out and said
 
02:33:39.590 --> 02:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
that there was a cost
 
02:33:41.910 --> 02:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
quite a large cost to this but that that
 
02:33:42.870 --> 02:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
cost could be
 
02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:46.150 align:start position:0%
cost could be
then

02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
diverted off to our residents which i
 
02:33:50.710 --> 02:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
must tell you that i'm taking 90 percent
 
02:33:52.230 --> 02:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
of their income just for them to live
 
02:33:53.270 --> 02:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
here so i
 
02:33:56.710 --> 02:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
um had a hard time um
 
02:33:58.710 --> 02:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
going forward with a cost that i didn't
 
02:34:00.230 --> 02:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
know how much more it was going to cost
 
02:34:00.240 --> 02:34:00.870 align:start position:0%
know how much more it was going to cost
them

02:34:00.870 --> 02:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:34:03.110 --> 02:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh where atlantic broadband was the only
 
02:34:04.389 --> 02:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
people who had bid
 
02:34:07.110 --> 02:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
on when we went out to bid i'm asking
 
02:34:07.120 --> 02:34:08.230 align:start position:0%
on when we went out to bid i'm asking
for

02:34:08.230 --> 02:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:34:11.030 --> 02:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
a company to come in and provide um
 
02:34:12.790 --> 02:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
computer services for our residents i
 
02:34:13.670 --> 02:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
will tell you
 
02:34:16.389 --> 02:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
that we provide basic services
 
02:34:18.389 --> 02:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
throughout the home basic tv
 
02:34:22.309 --> 02:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
um but the if they wanted an additional
 
02:34:23.510 --> 02:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
or a computer
 
02:34:26.309 --> 02:34:26.319 align:start position:0%
with a phone attached to it that they
 
02:34:27.830 --> 02:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
had to do that on their own
 
02:34:31.110 --> 02:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
because of the um the cost and the
 
02:34:34.230 --> 02:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
um i i again
 
02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
um i don't know the exact amount that
 
02:34:38.630 --> 02:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
doit was talking about
 
02:34:41.270 --> 02:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
but um it didn't sound like a small
 
02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:43.590 align:start position:0%
but um it didn't sound like a small
amount

02:34:43.590 --> 02:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
amount
 
02:34:45.670 --> 02:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
and sir small amount of work that needed
 
02:34:47.190 --> 02:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
to be done in order to
 
02:34:49.429 --> 02:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
increase the bandwidth here at the home
 
02:34:51.190 --> 02:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
and to have that because again
 
02:34:53.830 --> 02:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
if the residents are by the library or
 
02:34:55.429 --> 02:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
um by the town hall
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
they are able to access the wi-fi that
 
02:35:00.469 --> 02:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
is available to them free of charge
 
02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:07.349 --> 02:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
bounce that throughout the home because
 
02:35:08.550 --> 02:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
02:35:11.349 --> 02:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
our medical carts that need to be on a
 
02:35:11.359 --> 02:35:11.990 align:start position:0%
our medical carts that need to be on a
segregated

02:35:11.990 --> 02:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
segregated
 
02:35:14.710 --> 02:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
due to hipaa guidance so we need to make
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
sure that that
 
02:35:18.150 --> 02:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
it absolutely has to be locked down we
 
02:35:20.389 --> 02:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
can't have any hipaa or phi
 
02:35:23.429 --> 02:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
issues going on our med carts are on
 
02:35:25.110 --> 02:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
wi-fi and so
 
02:35:27.270 --> 02:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
um it was very concerning that we would
 
02:35:29.590 --> 02:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
have two um potential
 
02:35:32.309 --> 02:35:32.319 align:start position:0%
uh signals being um thrown out through
 
02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
the home
 
02:35:35.750 --> 02:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
and that our med carts would pick up on
 
02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:36.389 align:start position:0%
and that our med carts would pick up on
that

02:35:36.389 --> 02:35:36.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:35:38.870 --> 02:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
and be um have an issue with the
 
02:35:41.110 --> 02:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
transmission of the medical record
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
so let me translate that into what's
 
02:35:45.429 --> 02:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
important to me that i think
 
02:35:49.190 --> 02:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
i heard you say that if the
 
02:35:51.990 --> 02:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
resident is able to move to known
 
02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:53.030 align:start position:0%
resident is able to move to known
locations

02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
locations
 
02:35:55.750 --> 02:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
in the health center that they can get
 
02:35:55.760 --> 02:35:56.150 align:start position:0%
in the health center that they can get
good

02:35:56.150 --> 02:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:35:59.510 --> 02:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
strong internet access at no cost to
 
02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:00.230 align:start position:0%
strong internet access at no cost to
them

02:36:00.230 --> 02:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:36:01.910 --> 02:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
that is correct and we have a computer
 
02:36:03.990 --> 02:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
room called the ben pen excuse me
 
02:36:07.110 --> 02:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
um what did we call it i'm sorry i've
 
02:36:08.950 --> 02:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
lost my mind um we've got
 
02:36:11.590 --> 02:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
three free computers that sit in a room
 
02:36:12.550 --> 02:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
that they can go
 
02:36:14.150 --> 02:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
and they can access whether they're
 
02:36:15.750 --> 02:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
skyping with their family their loved
 
02:36:15.760 --> 02:36:16.389 align:start position:0%
skyping with their family their loved
ones

02:36:16.389 --> 02:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
ones
 
02:36:19.110 --> 02:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
they have computer access we just do not
 
02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:20.150 align:start position:0%
they have computer access we just do not
provide

02:36:20.150 --> 02:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:36:22.150 --> 02:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
access computer access in their
 
02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
individual rooms
 
02:36:25.349 --> 02:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
um if they're over by the library the
 
02:36:29.270 --> 02:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:31.750 --> 02:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
main street area they're able to um
 
02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:32.469 align:start position:0%
main street area they're able to um
access

02:36:32.469 --> 02:36:32.479 align:start position:0%
access
 
02:36:34.870 --> 02:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
the internet free the wi-fi is there
 
02:36:36.150 --> 02:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
free we are not
 
02:36:39.510 --> 02:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
able to blast it across the entire house
 
02:36:42.950 --> 02:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
i get it so so i'm just curious with the
 
02:36:42.960 --> 02:36:44.070 align:start position:0%
i get it so so i'm just curious with the
lockdown

02:36:44.070 --> 02:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
lockdown
 
02:36:46.950 --> 02:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
you don't call it lockdown but with the
 
02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:48.309 align:start position:0%
you don't call it lockdown but with the
segregated

02:36:48.309 --> 02:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
segregated
 
02:36:51.750 --> 02:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
alzheimer dementia unit where they are
 
02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
kept securely because there are escape
 
02:36:54.240 --> 02:36:55.510 align:start position:0%
kept securely because there are escape
risks

02:36:55.510 --> 02:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
risks
 
02:36:57.510 --> 02:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
are they able to go to the portion of
 
02:36:59.190 --> 02:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
your building where they
 
02:37:02.070 --> 02:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
need internet access or or maybe the
 
02:37:03.750 --> 02:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
real answer there is
 
02:37:06.309 --> 02:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
there they have a mental condition that
 
02:37:08.070 --> 02:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
really makes it so they're not
 
02:37:11.270 --> 02:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
internet seeking people to begin with
 
02:37:13.030 --> 02:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
that is correct but if there's a family
 
02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
member who wants to reach out to one of
 
02:37:15.349 --> 02:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
our veterans
 
02:37:17.510 --> 02:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
in that area they're able to take a
 
02:37:19.270 --> 02:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
secure laptop or
 
02:37:22.389 --> 02:37:22.399 align:start position:0%
tablet over there and interact so and
 
02:37:24.469 --> 02:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
and set it up so that that resident
 
02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
is able to communicate to their loved
 
02:37:27.510 --> 02:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
ones from
 
02:37:30.870 --> 02:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
their unit where they're safe and secure
 
02:37:33.190 --> 02:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
so it sounds to me from what you've said
 
02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
that you share
 
02:37:37.349 --> 02:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
with that we share a common concern that
 
02:37:39.270 --> 02:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
particularly with covet and
 
02:37:42.070 --> 02:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
the inability of families to come in
 
02:37:42.710 --> 02:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
that this
 
02:37:45.830 --> 02:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
skyping and zooming is vastly more
 
02:37:47.110 --> 02:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
important than it was
 
02:37:49.990 --> 02:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
over a year ago and absolutely we have
 
02:37:51.110 --> 02:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
about 15
 
02:37:54.469 --> 02:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
currently laptops pads tablets
 
02:37:57.110 --> 02:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
and our recreational staff who have
 
02:37:58.230 --> 02:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
access to
 
02:38:00.309 --> 02:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
wi-fi and they're able to get around to
 
02:38:02.389 --> 02:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
the residents whose family and
 
02:38:05.670 --> 02:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
again they set up specific times um
 
02:38:07.590 --> 02:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
that they're either phone calls again
 
02:38:09.429 --> 02:38:09.439 align:start position:0%
skyping face timing
 
02:38:11.429 --> 02:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
um so that these uh families and their
 
02:38:14.309 --> 02:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
loved ones are able to communicate
 
02:38:17.349 --> 02:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
as well as window visits as you know
 
02:38:19.190 --> 02:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
we have areas around the building that
 
02:38:21.110 --> 02:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
is clear glass
 
02:38:23.590 --> 02:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
some of our our family members have said
 
02:38:24.950 --> 02:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
you know it's too hard to come in
 
02:38:27.349 --> 02:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
and have a mask on and be six feet away
 
02:38:30.230 --> 02:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
i can't hear him he can't hear me
 
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
i would rather do a window visit and so
 
02:38:34.469 --> 02:38:34.479 align:start position:0%
we set them up with
 
02:38:36.710 --> 02:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
a lawn chair and or a comfortable chair
 
02:38:39.030 --> 02:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
on the outside of a glass window
 
02:38:40.630 --> 02:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
and their loved ones on the inside and
 
02:38:42.230 --> 02:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
they're on cell phones talking to each
 
02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:42.710 align:start position:0%
they're on cell phones talking to each
other

02:38:42.710 --> 02:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:38:45.510 --> 02:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
because they can hear each other better
 
02:38:46.950 --> 02:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
i'd like to change
 
02:38:49.990 --> 02:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh the topic of the conversation
 
02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
about two and that's all those are all
 
02:38:54.230 --> 02:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
great answers i just i just wanted to
 
02:38:55.349 --> 02:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
follow up with you
 
02:38:58.230 --> 02:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
and see if you needed more money for
 
02:39:00.230 --> 02:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
repeaters internet repeaters and it
 
02:39:02.150 --> 02:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like you do
 
02:39:06.870 --> 02:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
um but the other ques question is
 
02:39:08.950 --> 02:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
two years ago or so maybe it's been
 
02:39:11.590 --> 02:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
three and time flies but
 
02:39:14.550 --> 02:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh i came out and did a site visit with
 
02:39:16.389 --> 02:39:16.399 align:start position:0%
you i don't know if you remember to look
 
02:39:17.990 --> 02:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
at whether or not
 
02:39:22.150 --> 02:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
the va manchester or the va in vermont
 
02:39:24.230 --> 02:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
would provide you with telemedicine
 
02:39:24.240 --> 02:39:25.270 align:start position:0%
would provide you with telemedicine
support

02:39:25.270 --> 02:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:39:27.429 --> 02:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
and if that telemedicine support in
 
02:39:29.590 --> 02:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
theory if it was going to be able to
 
02:39:31.429 --> 02:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
help you reduce your personnel
 
02:39:31.439 --> 02:39:33.030 align:start position:0%
help you reduce your personnel
requirements

02:39:33.030 --> 02:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:39:36.230 --> 02:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
it has has there been telemedicine put
 
02:39:37.030 --> 02:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
into place
 
02:39:40.630 --> 02:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
and what affect if any has it had on
 
02:39:42.469 --> 02:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
your personnel needs
 
02:39:44.389 --> 02:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
um actually we had some of our residents
 
02:39:46.870 --> 02:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
as you know who um still travel down so
 
02:39:48.230 --> 02:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
we had to have to have to do
 
02:39:50.230 --> 02:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
transportation down to the va
 
02:39:52.710 --> 02:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
or to a cboc that they're receiving
 
02:39:53.590 --> 02:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
02:39:56.550 --> 02:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
so we have had mental health come in the
 
02:39:56.560 --> 02:39:57.030 align:start position:0%
so we have had mental health come in the
va

02:39:57.030 --> 02:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
va
 
02:40:00.230 --> 02:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
issued us a specific laptop that they
 
02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:00.950 align:start position:0%
issued us a specific laptop that they
felt

02:40:00.950 --> 02:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
felt
 
02:40:03.990 --> 02:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
met their guidelines to the va needs
 
02:40:06.150 --> 02:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
in order for one of their providers to
 
02:40:08.150 --> 02:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
provide telehealth medicine to our
 
02:40:08.160 --> 02:40:08.950 align:start position:0%
provide telehealth medicine to our
veterans

02:40:08.950 --> 02:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
02:40:11.349 --> 02:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
and so we started that probably uh the
 
02:40:12.950 --> 02:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
end of august last year
 
02:40:15.670 --> 02:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
and um from the amount that or the
 
02:40:17.110 --> 02:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
conversations i've had
 
02:40:19.030 --> 02:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
with my staff it seems to be going quite
 
02:40:21.510 --> 02:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
well some of our residents are okay with
 
02:40:22.309 --> 02:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
that others
 
02:40:25.269 --> 02:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
don't care for it so um we work around
 
02:40:26.630 --> 02:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
what our residents feel comfortable
 
02:40:26.640 --> 02:40:28.469 align:start position:0%
what our residents feel comfortable
doing

02:40:28.469 --> 02:40:28.479 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:40:30.630 --> 02:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
okay so it sounds like it's relieved a
 
02:40:32.230 --> 02:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
little bit of pressure
 
02:40:34.790 --> 02:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
on the fact that you have vacancies but
 
02:40:35.670 --> 02:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
you're not really
 
02:40:37.590 --> 02:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
ready to get rid of any permanent
 
02:40:39.910 --> 02:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
positions because of it
 
02:40:41.670 --> 02:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
no because unfortunately we have plenty
 
02:40:43.510 --> 02:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
of our residents who still need to go to
 
02:40:45.590 --> 02:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
outside providers for different things
 
02:40:48.790 --> 02:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
and so i get it
 
02:40:51.510 --> 02:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
so um are there any questions from any
 
02:40:54.790 --> 02:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:58.150 --> 02:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
i i really appreciate um you coming in
 
02:40:59.830 --> 02:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
and talking with us
 
02:41:03.030 --> 02:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
and uh and frankly just having you talk
 
02:41:04.870 --> 02:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
directly to the spreadsheet
 
02:41:08.150 --> 02:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
i think uh was very efficient
 
02:41:11.269 --> 02:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
and for me it was effective so so
 
02:41:13.750 --> 02:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't say that you should be
 
02:41:15.830 --> 02:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
concerned you didn't have any powerpoint
 
02:41:17.190 --> 02:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
and just
 
02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
other than i've never seen a military
 
02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:20.710 align:start position:0%
other than i've never seen a military
briefing

02:41:20.710 --> 02:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
briefing
 
02:41:22.309 --> 02:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
without one so i didn't know it was
 
02:41:24.630 --> 02:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
possible but uh
 
02:41:27.190 --> 02:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
all right i i don't have any further
 
02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:28.309 align:start position:0%
all right i i don't have any further
questions

02:41:28.309 --> 02:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:41:31.670 --> 02:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
um do you does anyone in the committee i
 
02:41:34.710 --> 02:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any so i i think you can
 
02:41:36.230 --> 02:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
go have a great day
 
02:41:38.389 --> 02:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
thank you sir thank you um for allowing
 
02:41:39.510 --> 02:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
me to present
 
02:41:40.790 --> 02:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
before you and i hope you all have a
 
02:41:44.710 --> 02:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
great day
 
02:41:48.790 --> 02:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
so so mr ripple um
 
02:41:50.630 --> 02:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
i think we're getting close to a
 
02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:52.309 align:start position:0%
i think we're getting close to a
lunchtime

02:41:52.309 --> 02:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
lunchtime
 
02:41:56.230 --> 02:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
um i think when we come back from lunch
 
02:41:58.950 --> 02:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
i want us to go look at section 22 of
 
02:42:01.670 --> 02:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
hba and see if we can approve it
 
02:42:04.710 --> 02:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
then we'll have uh representative walner
 
02:42:07.110 --> 02:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
kind of introduce us to the topic of
 
02:42:09.349 --> 02:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
section 39 the forensic mental health
 
02:42:09.359 --> 02:42:10.710 align:start position:0%
section 39 the forensic mental health
hospital

02:42:10.710 --> 02:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
02:42:13.990 --> 02:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
we'll go uh talk about how we might do a
 
02:42:14.870 --> 02:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
quick sort
 
02:42:18.630 --> 02:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
on on some of the accounts so we
 
02:42:22.790 --> 02:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
have a smaller target of mass
 
02:42:26.710 --> 02:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
and then hb1 representative irf will
 
02:42:29.429 --> 02:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
talk about that and introduces so i
 
02:42:31.750 --> 02:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
still think we have a pretty full
 
02:42:34.870 --> 02:42:34.880 align:start position:0%

02:44:49.670 --> 02:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
um website where
 
02:44:52.870 --> 02:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
the the language should be so
 
02:44:56.389 --> 02:44:56.399 align:start position:0%
let's let's everyone get on
 
02:45:05.590 --> 02:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:17.910 --> 02:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:20.070 --> 02:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
i do have section 22 pulled up here so i
 
02:45:22.389 --> 02:45:22.399 align:start position:0%
can share my screen if that doesn't work
 
02:45:24.870 --> 02:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
well that that's probably helpful i just
 
02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:25.429 align:start position:0%
well that that's probably helpful i just
uh

02:45:25.429 --> 02:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:45:28.469 --> 02:45:28.479 align:start position:0%
okay i found it
 
02:45:30.870 --> 02:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
well it's better to share it anyways so
 
02:45:32.550 --> 02:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
that we know that we're looking at the
 
02:45:33.269 --> 02:45:33.279 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
02:45:54.469 --> 02:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:57.590 --> 02:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
my notes on this
 
02:45:57.600 --> 02:46:03.030 align:start position:0%
my notes on this
um

02:46:03.030 --> 02:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:05.030 --> 02:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
we were thinking instead of a repeal
 
02:46:06.710 --> 02:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
maybe suspended
 
02:46:09.110 --> 02:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
and we heard from ms altman who said
 
02:46:11.110 --> 02:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
that she thought that repeal was
 
02:46:14.309 --> 02:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
still the right way to go um there was
 
02:46:15.190 --> 02:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
some question
 
02:46:17.429 --> 02:46:17.439 align:start position:0%
of whether or not the congregate housing
 
02:46:19.269 --> 02:46:19.279 align:start position:0%
is the main issue and if it should be
 
02:46:20.950 --> 02:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
separated from the
 
02:46:24.150 --> 02:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
grandfather or the grandparent foster
 
02:46:24.160 --> 02:46:25.269 align:start position:0%
grandfather or the grandparent foster
program

02:46:25.269 --> 02:46:25.279 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:46:29.190 --> 02:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
so um i think if i remember right
 
02:46:33.110 --> 02:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative walner you you had
 
02:46:36.389 --> 02:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
the concern about whether this should be
 
02:46:39.510 --> 02:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
a suspension instead of a repeal
 
02:46:43.910 --> 02:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
am i remembering that right uh yes
 
02:46:45.830 --> 02:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
mainly because they they were in the
 
02:46:49.429 --> 02:46:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:53.110 --> 02:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
so did ms altman's uh
 
02:46:56.550 --> 02:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
remarks placate you any or or
 
02:46:58.309 --> 02:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
because she's still advocating for
 
02:46:58.319 --> 02:47:01.750 align:start position:0%
because she's still advocating for
repeal

02:47:01.750 --> 02:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:03.990 --> 02:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
i you know what i it doesn't really
 
02:47:05.190 --> 02:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
matter i
 
02:47:07.590 --> 02:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
i think that this is a very popular
 
02:47:09.510 --> 02:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
program with it with
 
02:47:11.750 --> 02:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
some people in the senate so we'll
 
02:47:15.830 --> 02:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:19.349 --> 02:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
so um so we're repealing
 
02:47:25.670 --> 02:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:29.429 --> 02:47:29.439 align:start position:0%
is i'd like to hear a motion
 
02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
is there a motion to accept
 
02:47:37.830 --> 02:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:41.269 --> 02:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
i would make a motion to appeal
 
02:47:46.950 --> 02:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:49.590 --> 02:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
so say say your motion again i i missed
 
02:47:49.600 --> 02:47:56.150 align:start position:0%
so say say your motion again i i missed
it

02:47:56.150 --> 02:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:58.550 --> 02:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
can't turn that off i'm sorry um i would
 
02:47:59.349 --> 02:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
move that we
 
02:48:02.790 --> 02:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
repeat we accept house bill 2
 
02:48:05.990 --> 02:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
number 22 which is repealing
 
02:48:07.830 --> 02:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
several rsas i'm going to read them to
 
02:48:10.469 --> 02:48:10.479 align:start position:0%
you so i understand that motion is there
 
02:48:14.630 --> 02:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:17.910 --> 02:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative weiler seconds
 
02:48:22.710 --> 02:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:28.389 --> 02:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:30.230 --> 02:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
go ahead your rep you recognize
 
02:48:32.309 --> 02:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
representative wohler
 
02:48:36.469 --> 02:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
okay i am going to uh vote no
 
02:48:38.309 --> 02:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
okay because you you think this should
 
02:48:40.070 --> 02:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
be a suspension instead of a repeat i
 
02:48:40.080 --> 02:48:40.389 align:start position:0%
be a suspension instead of a repeat i
think

02:48:40.389 --> 02:48:40.399 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:48:44.150 --> 02:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
just be a suspension
 
02:48:45.429 --> 02:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
is there any is there any other
 
02:48:45.439 --> 02:48:49.590 align:start position:0%
is there any is there any other
discussion

02:48:49.590 --> 02:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:53.110 --> 02:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any uh i think the clerk
 
02:49:01.269 --> 02:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:04.790 --> 02:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative earth yes representative
 
02:49:06.150 --> 02:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
weiler votes yes
 
02:49:10.070 --> 02:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative bean yes
 
02:49:13.630 --> 02:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
representative walner no
 
02:49:16.950 --> 02:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative no
 
02:49:20.710 --> 02:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
representative rogers no
 
02:49:24.830 --> 02:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh
 
02:49:29.590 --> 02:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:32.950 --> 02:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
02:49:36.630 --> 02:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
so uh i i so we'll be
 
02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
going forward with a repeal and then
 
02:49:40.469 --> 02:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
representative walnut i
 
02:49:42.389 --> 02:49:42.399 align:start position:0%
i know you have friends in the senate
 
02:49:45.830 --> 02:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
maybe uh maybe we'll see this again
 
02:49:49.269 --> 02:49:49.279 align:start position:0%
you might okay so
 
02:49:52.389 --> 02:49:52.399 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
02:49:55.750 --> 02:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
or excuse me mr ripple did you
 
02:49:58.790 --> 02:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
slide down to section 39 or
 
02:50:00.950 --> 02:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
or really whatever representative
 
02:50:02.790 --> 02:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
wallner wants to do now she has the
 
02:50:02.800 --> 02:50:03.830 align:start position:0%
wallner wants to do now she has the
floor

02:50:03.830 --> 02:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
floor
 
02:50:07.110 --> 02:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:10.550 --> 02:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
so section 39 is the uh section
 
02:50:14.150 --> 02:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh that pertains to the uh
 
02:50:17.510 --> 02:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
psychiatric forensic unit so
 
02:50:20.550 --> 02:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
kevin maybe we could
 
02:50:22.710 --> 02:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
so are people feeling familiar with what
 
02:50:25.110 --> 02:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
was in house bill 2.
 
02:50:30.230 --> 02:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
it really was um 17.25
 
02:50:33.429 --> 02:50:33.439 align:start position:0%
million dollars to construct a
 
02:50:36.710 --> 02:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
60-bed forensic hospital
 
02:50:39.830 --> 02:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
and it suggests it doesn't suggest it
 
02:50:41.429 --> 02:50:41.439 align:start position:0%
directs that the department
 
02:50:44.550 --> 02:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
would use federal funding
 
02:50:48.710 --> 02:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
if if it's available yes
 
02:50:52.510 --> 02:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
to pay for it and if it's not then the
 
02:50:56.309 --> 02:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
17.250 would be bonded
 
02:51:00.309 --> 02:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
um so i was kind of concerned about that
 
02:51:02.309 --> 02:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
because i wondered how
 
02:51:04.230 --> 02:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
how you did that outside the capital
 
02:51:06.389 --> 02:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
budget and i had concerns about the
 
02:51:07.910 --> 02:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
capital budget so i did it
 
02:51:09.269 --> 02:51:09.279 align:start position:0%
over the weekend just did a little
 
02:51:11.030 --> 02:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
research about what kinds of bills have
 
02:51:12.710 --> 02:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
we had before
 
02:51:14.950 --> 02:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
um we've had a number of bills around
 
02:51:14.960 --> 02:51:16.469 align:start position:0%
um we've had a number of bills around
this

02:51:16.469 --> 02:51:16.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:51:19.670 --> 02:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
most of them set up study committees and
 
02:51:23.190 --> 02:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
oversight committees but there is right
 
02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:23.750 align:start position:0%
oversight committees but there is right
now

02:51:23.750 --> 02:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:51:27.870 --> 02:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
a bill in the senate it's senate bill
 
02:51:27.880 --> 02:51:30.710 align:start position:0%
a bill in the senate it's senate bill
156

02:51:30.710 --> 02:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
156
 
02:51:36.550 --> 02:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:39.670 --> 02:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
and it they are re it's the motion will
 
02:51:42.550 --> 02:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
be to re-refer it
 
02:51:46.070 --> 02:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
um in the senate
 
02:51:48.710 --> 02:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
so they're obviously holding it in the
 
02:51:48.720 --> 02:51:50.230 align:start position:0%
so they're obviously holding it in the
senate

02:51:50.230 --> 02:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
senate
 
02:51:53.590 --> 02:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
um what this bill does is basically and
 
02:51:55.030 --> 02:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
i'll show you what
 
02:51:58.150 --> 02:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
what was in the um in house bill
 
02:52:01.910 --> 02:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
4 from this period
 
02:52:05.510 --> 02:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
it basically is the sum of 8.75
 
02:52:09.830 --> 02:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
million it's a 25-bed psychiatric
 
02:52:14.230 --> 02:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
facility it cannot be
 
02:52:19.110 --> 02:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
contracted out to a private provider
 
02:52:20.710 --> 02:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
let's see i can't remember exactly the
 
02:52:22.790 --> 02:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
management of the secure psychiatric
 
02:52:24.309 --> 02:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
facility shall be
 
02:52:26.070 --> 02:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the department of
 
02:52:27.670 --> 02:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
02:52:30.230 --> 02:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
and the department may may contract with
 
02:52:32.309 --> 02:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
a private psychiatric service
 
02:52:35.110 --> 02:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
provider but shall not enter into a
 
02:52:35.120 --> 02:52:35.910 align:start position:0%
provider but shall not enter into a
contract

02:52:35.910 --> 02:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
contract
 
02:52:38.870 --> 02:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
for the construction or operation of the
 
02:52:40.389 --> 02:52:40.399 align:start position:0%
facility with a private
 
02:52:42.630 --> 02:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
for-profit prison construction or
 
02:52:45.510 --> 02:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
management company
 
02:52:48.950 --> 02:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
so that's what the senate bill says
 
02:52:51.590 --> 02:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
and now kevin can we go to show what was
 
02:52:57.030 --> 02:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
in-house before
 
02:52:58.630 --> 02:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
when you're ready for a question i think
 
02:53:00.950 --> 02:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative erp has his hands up
 
02:53:05.110 --> 02:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
oh okay i'm fine if a question fine
 
02:53:07.590 --> 02:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative walnut um maybe
 
02:53:08.630 --> 02:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
i'm misreading this but
 
02:53:12.070 --> 02:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
when i read this hb2 section three
 
02:53:13.269 --> 02:53:13.279 align:start position:0%
it sounds about they're asking for
 
02:53:15.349 --> 02:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
another 17 million quarter on top of
 
02:53:17.750 --> 02:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
what as i recall was in the original
 
02:53:20.550 --> 02:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
hp right four so they're looking at like
 
02:53:20.560 --> 02:53:21.670 align:start position:0%
hp right four so they're looking at like
35

02:53:21.670 --> 02:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
35
 
02:53:23.510 --> 02:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars total so i have that
 
02:53:23.520 --> 02:53:25.830 align:start position:0%
million dollars total so i have that
right

02:53:25.830 --> 02:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:53:27.590 --> 02:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not really sure but i would like to
 
02:53:29.429 --> 02:53:29.439 align:start position:0%
look at i'm not really sure if they're
 
02:53:30.309 --> 02:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
adding it on
 
02:53:32.389 --> 02:53:32.399 align:start position:0%
it see they have they already have the
 
02:53:32.399 --> 02:53:33.510 align:start position:0%
it see they have they already have the
authority

02:53:33.510 --> 02:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
authority
 
02:53:37.510 --> 02:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
right they already have the authority
 
02:53:41.910 --> 02:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
to get 8.75
 
02:53:45.269 --> 02:53:45.279 align:start position:0%
million to build a 25 unit
 
02:53:48.950 --> 02:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh a 25 bed hospital and that
 
02:53:51.990 --> 02:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's sp 60 50 156 though right didn't
 
02:53:52.710 --> 02:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
we didn't
 
02:53:55.990 --> 02:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
the our last hb4 include a 60-bed
 
02:53:58.710 --> 02:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
unit with more money like 17 million
 
02:53:58.720 --> 02:53:59.750 align:start position:0%
unit with more money like 17 million
dollars

02:53:59.750 --> 02:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:54:02.469 --> 02:54:02.479 align:start position:0%
no uh can we go to the house before
 
02:54:02.479 --> 02:54:02.870 align:start position:0%
no uh can we go to the house before
sorry

02:54:02.870 --> 02:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:54:05.429 --> 02:54:05.439 align:start position:0%
yeah okay here's house bill for this is
 
02:54:06.550 --> 02:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
what we did
 
02:54:10.590 --> 02:54:10.600 align:start position:0%
two years ago it's
 
02:54:15.510 --> 02:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
8.75 and it is a 25 bed
 
02:54:18.710 --> 02:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
hospital and this they have
 
02:54:21.429 --> 02:54:21.439 align:start position:0%
they did not spend down is that right
 
02:54:24.469 --> 02:54:24.479 align:start position:0%
kevin they didn't spin this down
 
02:54:27.269 --> 02:54:27.279 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding and that's why
 
02:54:28.070 --> 02:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
in the current
 
02:54:29.590 --> 02:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
trailer bill it starts with the
 
02:54:30.790 --> 02:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
department shall proceed with the
 
02:54:32.469 --> 02:54:32.479 align:start position:0%
construction of a 60 bed facility
 
02:54:34.309 --> 02:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
utilizing funds appropriated in the
 
02:54:36.630 --> 02:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal year ending june 30th 2021. so i
 
02:54:38.230 --> 02:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
believe that references the original
 
02:54:40.150 --> 02:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
8.75 million
 
02:54:42.790 --> 02:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
right so they already have the authority
 
02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:54:46.830 --> 02:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
for the 8.75
 
02:54:50.150 --> 02:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
so this it seems to me
 
02:54:53.429 --> 02:54:53.439 align:start position:0%
like we could almost take
 
02:54:56.870 --> 02:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
out what's in here and just
 
02:54:58.910 --> 02:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
they already have the authority for the
 
02:54:58.920 --> 02:55:00.630 align:start position:0%
they already have the authority for the
8.75

02:55:00.630 --> 02:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
8.75
 
02:55:03.510 --> 02:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
um and they can proceed with that gives
 
02:55:03.990 --> 02:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
them the
 
02:55:06.870 --> 02:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
right to proceed with the 25 bed
 
02:55:06.880 --> 02:55:09.910 align:start position:0%
right to proceed with the 25 bed
hospital

02:55:09.910 --> 02:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:12.070 --> 02:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
so they but they've increased it to a 60
 
02:55:13.590 --> 02:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
bed hospital
 
02:55:17.269 --> 02:55:17.279 align:start position:0%
they had well they increased it
 
02:55:19.510 --> 02:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2 they they requested an
 
02:55:21.429 --> 02:55:21.439 align:start position:0%
increase 260.
 
02:55:24.309 --> 02:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
okay so they're authorized for 25 beds
 
02:55:25.269 --> 02:55:25.279 align:start position:0%
and they have some
 
02:55:28.550 --> 02:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
money authorized and that money
 
02:55:31.590 --> 02:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
was authorized is is non-lapsing it's
 
02:55:33.510 --> 02:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
still good even if it goes into the next
 
02:55:38.790 --> 02:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:40.469 --> 02:55:40.479 align:start position:0%
it says here the sum appropriated shall
 
02:55:42.070 --> 02:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
be non-lapsing provided that any
 
02:55:43.349 --> 02:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
unexpected amount of
 
02:55:44.950 --> 02:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
construction shall lapse to the general
 
02:55:46.469 --> 02:55:46.479 align:start position:0%
fund so
 
02:55:49.750 --> 02:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
so what is it is is it a correct
 
02:55:52.070 --> 02:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
understanding then that what they're
 
02:55:53.349 --> 02:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
doing is
 
02:55:57.110 --> 02:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
increasing the bed count from 25 to 60
 
02:56:00.070 --> 02:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
increasing the costs associated with it
 
02:56:00.080 --> 02:56:00.790 align:start position:0%
increasing the costs associated with it
and

02:56:00.790 --> 02:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:56:04.070 --> 02:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
creating an avenue to bonding to get the
 
02:56:05.110 --> 02:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
extra money
 
02:56:07.030 --> 02:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
if we don't appropriate it is that is
 
02:56:09.750 --> 02:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
that a correct understanding
 
02:56:13.269 --> 02:56:13.279 align:start position:0%
that sounds yes what that's what it
 
02:56:16.389 --> 02:56:16.399 align:start position:0%
looks like house bill 2 was doing
 
02:56:19.190 --> 02:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's my understanding too i i
 
02:56:20.550 --> 02:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
just would note that karen does over
 
02:56:21.429 --> 02:56:21.439 align:start position:0%
hand raised
 
02:56:23.750 --> 02:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i was about to go to representative
 
02:56:24.870 --> 02:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
rounds next
 
02:56:24.880 --> 02:56:28.550 align:start position:0%
rounds next
okay

02:56:28.550 --> 02:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:31.110 --> 02:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh kevin if you don't mind
 
02:56:32.870 --> 02:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
just bringing over joe christie as well
 
02:56:33.990 --> 02:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
because there may be
 
02:56:35.349 --> 02:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
some questions that are a little more
 
02:56:37.349 --> 02:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
in-depth that he might be able to answer
 
02:56:38.790 --> 02:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
but just to give a little bit more
 
02:56:41.510 --> 02:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
history the appropriation
 
02:56:44.389 --> 02:56:44.399 align:start position:0%
that was in the final house bill 4 was
 
02:56:46.230 --> 02:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
for a 25 bed unit and the amount
 
02:56:48.070 --> 02:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
appropriated was only half the amount
 
02:56:50.230 --> 02:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
that was needed to construct that 25 bed
 
02:56:50.240 --> 02:56:51.030 align:start position:0%
that was needed to construct that 25 bed
unit

02:56:51.030 --> 02:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
unit
 
02:56:53.190 --> 02:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
the idea being that we would only need
 
02:56:54.550 --> 02:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
half the funds
 
02:56:57.030 --> 02:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
last biennium to start the construction
 
02:56:58.469 --> 02:56:58.479 align:start position:0%
and additional funds would be
 
02:56:58.479 --> 02:56:59.269 align:start position:0%
and additional funds would be
appropriated

02:56:59.269 --> 02:56:59.279 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
02:57:02.630 --> 02:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
in 2223 the
 
02:57:05.750 --> 02:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
original uh proposal made by the
 
02:57:05.760 --> 02:57:06.389 align:start position:0%
original uh proposal made by the
department

02:57:06.389 --> 02:57:06.399 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:57:08.870 --> 02:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
and the governor that were in the house
 
02:57:11.349 --> 02:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
bill 2 has introduced in 2021
 
02:57:13.830 --> 02:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
was a 60 bed unit that i believe was
 
02:57:15.590 --> 02:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
closer to that 40 million
 
02:57:22.550 --> 02:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
number that was mentioned earlier
 
02:57:25.190 --> 02:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
so so if you want to hand it off to mr
 
02:57:26.070 --> 02:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
christie that's
 
02:57:29.030 --> 02:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's fine with me we're just talking
 
02:57:30.710 --> 02:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
joe do you have anything else you would
 
02:57:32.790 --> 02:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
you would add as background or current
 
02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:34.550 align:start position:0%
you would add as background or current
information

02:57:34.550 --> 02:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:57:37.990 --> 02:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
um i don't i apologize i i
 
02:57:39.910 --> 02:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
was being brought over when uh when you
 
02:57:41.349 --> 02:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
were speaking so i didn't quite hear
 
02:57:42.710 --> 02:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
everything that you had just said karen
 
02:57:42.720 --> 02:57:43.269 align:start position:0%
everything that you had just said karen
but

02:57:43.269 --> 02:57:43.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:57:46.870 --> 02:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
um but in general it
 
02:57:49.750 --> 02:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh the initial construction for a 25 bed
 
02:57:51.670 --> 02:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
facility was estimated to be around
 
02:57:53.830 --> 02:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
16.5 million half of which was
 
02:57:55.670 --> 02:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
appropriated last biennium
 
02:57:58.710 --> 02:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
um and as karen mentioned that the at
 
02:58:00.150 --> 02:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
the end of her
 
02:58:02.950 --> 02:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
point there uh the departments in the
 
02:58:07.670 --> 02:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:10.309 --> 02:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
so uh representative weiler your hand
 
02:58:12.309 --> 02:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
was up
 
02:58:15.269 --> 02:58:15.279 align:start position:0%
i thank you mr chair now a lot of what
 
02:58:17.190 --> 02:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
we've been looking at lately in viewing
 
02:58:18.870 --> 02:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
is how much
 
02:58:21.110 --> 02:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
people are in emergency departments
 
02:58:22.389 --> 02:58:22.399 align:start position:0%
because it is
 
02:58:24.070 --> 02:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
for them and all this kind of delay and
 
02:58:26.150 --> 02:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
all that we get
 
02:58:30.389 --> 02:58:30.399 align:start position:0%
emails as well about that so is this
 
02:58:32.950 --> 02:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
60 versus 25 because of all this
 
02:58:34.469 --> 02:58:34.479 align:start position:0%
pressure it seems like we
 
02:58:36.469 --> 02:58:36.479 align:start position:0%
have an increase in in mental health
 
02:58:38.630 --> 02:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
problems is that true
 
02:58:38.640 --> 02:58:41.750 align:start position:0%
problems is that true
no

02:58:41.750 --> 02:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:45.110 --> 02:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
um so again this is uh joe cruz the cfo
 
02:58:46.790 --> 02:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire hospital
 
02:58:49.830 --> 02:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
so uh the increase to 60 beds is not
 
02:58:51.429 --> 02:58:51.439 align:start position:0%
necessarily a reflection of the
 
02:58:53.190 --> 02:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
emergency boarding room crisis that's
 
02:58:55.349 --> 02:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
that's grown over the pandemic
 
02:58:58.870 --> 02:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
um i this facility is really targeted
 
02:58:58.880 --> 02:58:59.269 align:start position:0%
um i this facility is really targeted
more

02:58:59.269 --> 02:58:59.279 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:59:03.269 --> 02:59:03.279 align:start position:0%
at the forensic patient population
 
02:59:06.230 --> 02:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
who you know many of which are currently
 
02:59:09.990 --> 02:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:12.550 --> 02:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
there there could there would be some
 
02:59:14.070 --> 02:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
patients at new hampshire hospital that
 
02:59:15.590 --> 02:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate for this facility
 
02:59:16.469 --> 02:59:16.479 align:start position:0%
and so that
 
02:59:19.190 --> 02:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
that regard it would free up some
 
02:59:21.030 --> 02:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
capacity for individuals in emergency
 
02:59:23.510 --> 02:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
rooms but that's not necessarily the
 
02:59:25.349 --> 02:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
primary intent here it's more about
 
02:59:26.950 --> 02:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
those individuals
 
02:59:28.469 --> 02:59:28.479 align:start position:0%
or currently has a department of
 
02:59:30.150 --> 02:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
corrections um but
 
02:59:33.990 --> 02:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
but maybe don't have any sort of
 
02:59:38.309 --> 02:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
commitment per se so i believe that's
 
02:59:39.910 --> 02:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
that's really where this this came from
 
02:59:42.150 --> 02:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
i i joined the team uh
 
02:59:43.590 --> 02:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
right around committee a conference when
 
02:59:44.860 --> 02:59:44.870 align:start position:0%
this was being discussed
 
02:59:44.870 --> 02:59:47.750 align:start position:0%
this was being discussed
[Music]

02:59:47.750 --> 02:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:59:52.550 --> 02:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
yes sir uh if these people move from the
 
02:59:56.469 --> 02:59:56.479 align:start position:0%
um prison where they house now
 
02:59:58.710 --> 02:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
does that mean that we'll have lower
 
03:00:03.990 --> 03:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:05.429 --> 03:00:05.439 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we can speak for
 
03:00:07.269 --> 03:00:07.279 align:start position:0%
corrections i i don't
 
03:00:09.670 --> 03:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know the definite answer to that
 
03:00:10.950 --> 03:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
but the
 
03:00:12.870 --> 03:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many people they have
 
03:00:14.710 --> 03:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
in their um
 
03:00:16.710 --> 03:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
in their facility but they would no
 
03:00:19.269 --> 03:00:19.279 align:start position:0%
longer be there
 
03:00:23.590 --> 03:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative norgren
 
03:00:27.030 --> 03:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
03:00:30.150 --> 03:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
maybe karen can follow up with us
 
03:00:33.190 --> 03:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
on how many they have over at the
 
03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:34.309 align:start position:0%
on how many they have over at the
concord

03:00:34.309 --> 03:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
concord
 
03:00:36.710 --> 03:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh prison that would be helpful the
 
03:00:38.790 --> 03:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
other thing i would bring up again
 
03:00:41.429 --> 03:00:41.439 align:start position:0%
i think we've discussed is that none of
 
03:00:43.030 --> 03:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
this seems to be going through the
 
03:00:44.469 --> 03:00:44.479 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
03:00:47.750 --> 03:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
and the public works committee
 
03:00:51.429 --> 03:00:51.439 align:start position:0%
and the bonding outside of house bill 2
 
03:00:53.910 --> 03:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound very reasonable anyway
 
03:00:56.469 --> 03:00:56.479 align:start position:0%
just a comment and a question
 
03:01:00.150 --> 03:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you so my understanding from the
 
03:01:01.750 --> 03:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
governor's office is that
 
03:01:03.670 --> 03:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
um and i i think i've provided this
 
03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:04.790 align:start position:0%
um and i i think i've provided this
information

03:01:04.790 --> 03:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:01:07.510 --> 03:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
but that the the intent of the federal
 
03:01:09.750 --> 03:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
funds would be the federal stimulus
 
03:01:13.110 --> 03:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
funds in the bill that just passed um at
 
03:01:14.469 --> 03:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
the federal level
 
03:01:16.790 --> 03:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
we don't have any other department funds
 
03:01:18.230 --> 03:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
federally that we could use for this
 
03:01:18.240 --> 03:01:19.510 align:start position:0%
federally that we could use for this
purpose

03:01:19.510 --> 03:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
03:01:21.269 --> 03:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
most of our grants do not allow us to
 
03:01:23.269 --> 03:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
build infrastructure we can
 
03:01:25.750 --> 03:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
often repair things and and that type of
 
03:01:27.990 --> 03:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
thing but we cannot build infrastructure
 
03:01:32.469 --> 03:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
um the as far as the bonding goes my
 
03:01:34.710 --> 03:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
understanding is that
 
03:01:37.269 --> 03:01:37.279 align:start position:0%
the intent was that if the federal
 
03:01:39.670 --> 03:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
stimulus dollars were not available
 
03:01:42.550 --> 03:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
that in a later phase of the budget uh
 
03:01:43.990 --> 03:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
when we knew for sure that they were not
 
03:01:46.309 --> 03:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
available we would work
 
03:01:48.389 --> 03:01:48.399 align:start position:0%
in a likelihood with the senate at this
 
03:01:50.150 --> 03:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
point to try to work that into the
 
03:01:53.830 --> 03:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:57.670 --> 03:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:00.070 --> 03:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
i think and i was just looking to see if
 
03:02:03.190 --> 03:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
i had it um
 
03:02:05.190 --> 03:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
i was wondering how it was what i was
 
03:02:06.950 --> 03:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
sitting here wondering was how many
 
03:02:10.150 --> 03:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
um people there are at the prison now
 
03:02:11.670 --> 03:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
that would transfer
 
03:02:15.190 --> 03:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
over to this type of a facility
 
03:02:19.190 --> 03:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
and i believe the senate did get some
 
03:02:22.309 --> 03:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
testimony around that or at least
 
03:02:26.389 --> 03:02:26.399 align:start position:0%
um some information about that
 
03:02:28.710 --> 03:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
so i would like i think i think the
 
03:02:29.990 --> 03:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
department of corrections
 
03:02:32.550 --> 03:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
could provide that for us and i someone
 
03:02:34.230 --> 03:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
sent me an email about it and i'm just
 
03:02:39.830 --> 03:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:43.269 --> 03:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
so if i could append to your question
 
03:02:45.429 --> 03:02:45.439 align:start position:0%
the extended part of the question which
 
03:02:45.439 --> 03:02:46.710 align:start position:0%
the extended part of the question which
is

03:02:46.710 --> 03:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:02:49.429 --> 03:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
we we're not seeing any prospective head
 
03:02:49.439 --> 03:02:49.990 align:start position:0%
we we're not seeing any prospective head
count

03:02:49.990 --> 03:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
count
 
03:02:53.349 --> 03:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
for how many people need to be needed
 
03:02:58.550 --> 03:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
to staff a 60-bed forensic hospital and
 
03:03:02.389 --> 03:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
and it could be quite significant um
 
03:03:04.150 --> 03:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
and so we ought to be looking at the
 
03:03:06.230 --> 03:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
manpower and personnel costs
 
03:03:10.469 --> 03:03:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:14.070 --> 03:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
so that go ahead sorry we're staffing
 
03:03:15.429 --> 03:03:15.439 align:start position:0%
this hospital
 
03:03:17.429 --> 03:03:17.439 align:start position:0%
you know with we build it we need to
 
03:03:18.710 --> 03:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
operate it so
 
03:03:21.750 --> 03:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious what the head count
 
03:03:25.190 --> 03:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
would be to demand this hospital and and
 
03:03:27.670 --> 03:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
to represent walnuts question what
 
03:03:29.830 --> 03:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
number of them are being transferred
 
03:03:32.150 --> 03:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
from the prison system because these are
 
03:03:32.160 --> 03:03:32.950 align:start position:0%
from the prison system because these are
still

03:03:32.950 --> 03:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
still
 
03:03:35.670 --> 03:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
from these are criminal mentally ill
 
03:03:36.870 --> 03:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
people right
 
03:03:40.630 --> 03:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
no not always not always sometimes
 
03:03:43.190 --> 03:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
they're they're held because they're um
 
03:03:45.030 --> 03:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
not guilty for reason of insanity or
 
03:03:46.389 --> 03:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
unfit to stand trial
 
03:03:48.630 --> 03:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
um and so therefore have not been
 
03:03:48.640 --> 03:03:49.830 align:start position:0%
um and so therefore have not been
convicted

03:03:49.830 --> 03:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
convicted
 
03:03:52.950 --> 03:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
um i i
 
03:03:55.269 --> 03:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
think that we have done the analysis on
 
03:03:57.670 --> 03:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
what a staffing model might look like
 
03:04:00.070 --> 03:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
um of course the staff wouldn't come
 
03:04:01.429 --> 03:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
into play until
 
03:04:04.950 --> 03:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh the 2425 biennium
 
03:04:08.070 --> 03:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
but i think we could um provide you with
 
03:04:08.080 --> 03:04:09.510 align:start position:0%
but i think we could um provide you with
what

03:04:09.510 --> 03:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:04:11.190 --> 03:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
what we have estimated the staffing
 
03:04:13.030 --> 03:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
model to look like it's a little
 
03:04:15.030 --> 03:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
early to know for sure until we know
 
03:04:17.190 --> 03:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
exactly what the building will look like
 
03:04:19.830 --> 03:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
um so the design phase is done but we
 
03:04:22.230 --> 03:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
can give you an estimate so
 
03:04:25.429 --> 03:04:25.439 align:start position:0%
representative wilder question uh
 
03:04:29.510 --> 03:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:32.070 --> 03:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
we keep seeing the statistics of people
 
03:04:32.870 --> 03:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
waiting in
 
03:04:35.110 --> 03:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms what are we doing about
 
03:04:36.230 --> 03:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
it and this and that
 
03:04:38.150 --> 03:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
we passed this two years ago and
 
03:04:39.750 --> 03:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
nothing's happened
 
03:04:42.710 --> 03:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
so we now we see an opportunity i think
 
03:04:44.710 --> 03:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
in the next month or two
 
03:04:46.550 --> 03:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
to find out we've got money coming from
 
03:04:47.910 --> 03:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
the feds
 
03:04:51.190 --> 03:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
to help build this and i think the best
 
03:04:52.469 --> 03:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
thing we can do right now
 
03:04:55.830 --> 03:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
is pass it and see what the uh
 
03:04:57.510 --> 03:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
we've got two more months before we see
 
03:04:58.870 --> 03:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
what's going to
 
03:05:02.550 --> 03:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
happen in the future and
 
03:05:04.950 --> 03:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
already been delayed in my mind two two
 
03:05:06.070 --> 03:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
years so
 
03:05:08.309 --> 03:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
i think i would just assume rather than
 
03:05:08.319 --> 03:05:09.349 align:start position:0%
i think i would just assume rather than
delay

03:05:09.349 --> 03:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
delay
 
03:05:11.990 --> 03:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh pass this out and send it along as it
 
03:05:12.710 --> 03:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
comes to us
 
03:05:16.389 --> 03:05:16.399 align:start position:0%
thank you so so i have a question about
 
03:05:18.150 --> 03:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
what you just said and then
 
03:05:22.870 --> 03:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:25.750 --> 03:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
has the department clearly stated
 
03:05:27.269 --> 03:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
because i don't recall it
 
03:05:29.830 --> 03:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
have they clearly stated that this
 
03:05:31.750 --> 03:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
60-bed facility
 
03:05:35.429 --> 03:05:35.439 align:start position:0%
will directly influence the reduction
 
03:05:37.590 --> 03:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
of the warehousing of mentally ill
 
03:05:39.990 --> 03:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
patients in emergency rooms
 
03:05:44.710 --> 03:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
no no so so i i'll let joe add he does
 
03:05:46.309 --> 03:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
have his hand raised too so
 
03:05:48.309 --> 03:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
i'll speak first and then would ask to
 
03:05:49.910 --> 03:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
let joe speak
 
03:05:52.230 --> 03:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
so when we testified back when it was a
 
03:05:53.750 --> 03:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
60-bed facility
 
03:05:56.630 --> 03:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
yes it would most certainly free up beds
 
03:05:59.190 --> 03:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
at new hampshire hospital
 
03:06:02.790 --> 03:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
it if it was a 25 bed facility i believe
 
03:06:04.309 --> 03:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
it only replaces the
 
03:06:07.750 --> 03:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
secure psychiatric unit at the prison so
 
03:06:08.950 --> 03:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
maybe that's the answer for the number
 
03:06:11.030 --> 03:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
of beds but we'll get you that as well
 
03:06:13.750 --> 03:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
um but it would absolutely free up beds
 
03:06:15.030 --> 03:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
at new hampshire hospital
 
03:06:18.710 --> 03:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
joe and therefore get the warehousing uh
 
03:06:22.150 --> 03:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms down it it would
 
03:06:23.590 --> 03:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
open up beds at new hampshire hospital
 
03:06:25.590 --> 03:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
to allow more input
 
03:06:28.630 --> 03:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
more people from the hospital yes okay
 
03:06:31.670 --> 03:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
and then joe did you did you want to
 
03:06:33.110 --> 03:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
you raised your hand right as she was
 
03:06:36.309 --> 03:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
speaking or you got a joint answer
 
03:06:38.309 --> 03:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
i i just wanted to confirm what she said
 
03:06:39.349 --> 03:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
so at the
 
03:06:42.150 --> 03:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
60 bed level um that would be where new
 
03:06:43.830 --> 03:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital would be able to free
 
03:06:45.429 --> 03:06:45.439 align:start position:0%
up some additional census
 
03:06:48.389 --> 03:06:48.399 align:start position:0%
the facility at a 25 bed unit likely
 
03:06:49.190 --> 03:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
would not
 
03:06:51.510 --> 03:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
impact emergency room boarding it would
 
03:06:52.469 --> 03:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
solve more of
 
03:06:54.870 --> 03:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
an issue where we have civilly committed
 
03:06:57.030 --> 03:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
or not guilty by reason of insanity
 
03:06:58.790 --> 03:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
individuals housed in a department
 
03:07:00.790 --> 03:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
corrections facility
 
03:07:03.670 --> 03:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative walner um i
 
03:07:03.680 --> 03:07:03.990 align:start position:0%
thank you representative walner um i
just

03:07:03.990 --> 03:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:07:06.950 --> 03:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
karen i just wondered if we had had do
 
03:07:07.590 --> 03:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:07:09.670 --> 03:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
any guidance from the federal government
 
03:07:11.510 --> 03:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
as to whether they will
 
03:07:14.550 --> 03:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
in this new round of funding allow
 
03:07:17.990 --> 03:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
us to do capital projects
 
03:07:22.550 --> 03:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
i have not um had an opportunity to read
 
03:07:25.110 --> 03:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
the summaries on on that on those funds
 
03:07:25.120 --> 03:07:25.670 align:start position:0%
the summaries on on that on those funds
i

03:07:25.670 --> 03:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:07:27.670 --> 03:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
i've only focused on the the stuff
 
03:07:31.510 --> 03:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's been specific to hhs so far
 
03:07:34.790 --> 03:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
and uh mr chair i i was just wondering
 
03:07:36.630 --> 03:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
if you might want to
 
03:07:39.190 --> 03:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
ask if there's anyone in the audience
 
03:07:40.550 --> 03:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
who has
 
03:07:42.550 --> 03:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
information around this i know that two
 
03:07:44.710 --> 03:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
years ago when we um
 
03:07:48.950 --> 03:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
when we looked at this there were
 
03:07:52.550 --> 03:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
people who had taken a lot a long look
 
03:07:53.510 --> 03:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
at this kind of
 
03:07:56.710 --> 03:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
um of a forensic hospital
 
03:08:00.070 --> 03:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
and had information about it
 
03:08:02.309 --> 03:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
okay we could we can do that um
 
03:08:04.150 --> 03:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
representative rogers has her hand up
 
03:08:05.990 --> 03:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
let's let's address her
 
03:08:07.830 --> 03:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
first and then we could go to the
 
03:08:07.840 --> 03:08:09.190 align:start position:0%
first and then we could go to the
audience

03:08:09.190 --> 03:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
audience
 
03:08:11.830 --> 03:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i'm just concerned a lot of
 
03:08:13.750 --> 03:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
the questions we're asking today
 
03:08:15.349 --> 03:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
for the same questions we were asking
 
03:08:17.429 --> 03:08:17.439 align:start position:0%
two years ago and we're not getting
 
03:08:18.630 --> 03:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
answers still
 
03:08:21.190 --> 03:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
but one thing that concerns me and maybe
 
03:08:22.790 --> 03:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
miss rounds can answer this
 
03:08:26.230 --> 03:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
two years ago we asked um if my city
 
03:08:29.429 --> 03:08:29.439 align:start position:0%
concord had ever been approached
 
03:08:31.750 --> 03:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
about this facility and about what it
 
03:08:32.790 --> 03:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
would mean
 
03:08:34.469 --> 03:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
since this is going to be put in on the
 
03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
state hospital grounds
 
03:08:39.510 --> 03:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
which is located between two schools the
 
03:08:41.030 --> 03:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
junior high school
 
03:08:43.269 --> 03:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
and the senior high school and next to a
 
03:08:45.110 --> 03:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
daycare center in the city
 
03:08:47.030 --> 03:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
and we asked if they'd done anything by
 
03:08:49.110 --> 03:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
contacting the city and asking
 
03:08:51.670 --> 03:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
for their input in it and we were told
 
03:08:53.269 --> 03:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
they had and then when i talked to the
 
03:08:54.870 --> 03:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
mayor he'd never heard of it
 
03:08:56.469 --> 03:08:56.479 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask again hope for an
 
03:08:57.990 --> 03:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
honest answer this time
 
03:09:00.870 --> 03:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
has the city been involved in any of the
 
03:09:02.550 --> 03:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
planning if any has been done
 
03:09:06.550 --> 03:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
karen so if i could just uh
 
03:09:08.870 --> 03:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
okay so you use the word honest there i
 
03:09:10.150 --> 03:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
think what we're looking for
 
03:09:14.830 --> 03:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
is is a correct answer i don't think we
 
03:09:14.840 --> 03:09:17.670 align:start position:0%
is is a correct answer i don't think we
wanna

03:09:17.670 --> 03:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
wanna
 
03:09:20.710 --> 03:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
i am not aware of what conversations
 
03:09:22.790 --> 03:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
have been happening joe can you
 
03:09:24.550 --> 03:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
he's saying yes he's aware so i'll let
 
03:09:26.229 --> 03:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
joe jump in there sure
 
03:09:29.190 --> 03:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
um we actually in a the most recent uh
 
03:09:30.950 --> 03:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
design meeting we had with our
 
03:09:33.190 --> 03:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
colleagues down at public works that was
 
03:09:34.630 --> 03:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
one of the first things that we talked
 
03:09:36.550 --> 03:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
about was
 
03:09:38.710 --> 03:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
needing to reach out and engage with the
 
03:09:39.910 --> 03:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
city of concord
 
03:09:43.030 --> 03:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
around this i mean i believe and i
 
03:09:44.550 --> 03:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
please don't take me as the expert on
 
03:09:46.309 --> 03:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
this but i believe um
 
03:09:48.070 --> 03:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
any major project that happens in the
 
03:09:49.670 --> 03:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
state office complex
 
03:09:52.229 --> 03:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
um i believe it actually has to be
 
03:09:53.110 --> 03:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
coordinated with
 
03:09:55.750 --> 03:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh the city of concord so but that is
 
03:09:55.760 --> 03:09:56.469 align:start position:0%
uh the city of concord so but that is
certainly

03:09:56.469 --> 03:09:56.479 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
03:09:59.030 --> 03:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
our intention so you you intend to talk
 
03:10:00.389 --> 03:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
to them but you haven't talked to them
 
03:10:00.399 --> 03:10:01.990 align:start position:0%
to them but you haven't talked to them
yet

03:10:01.990 --> 03:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
yet
 
03:10:05.349 --> 03:10:05.359 align:start position:0%
um the design uh engineers down at
 
03:10:07.030 --> 03:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
public works may have
 
03:10:09.349 --> 03:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm more on the finance side of
 
03:10:11.110 --> 03:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
this project so i don't wanna
 
03:10:13.990 --> 03:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
i don't want to give you a false answer
 
03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:14.389 align:start position:0%
i don't want to give you a false answer
but

03:10:14.389 --> 03:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:10:16.870 --> 03:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
we just discussed that i'm just
 
03:10:18.630 --> 03:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
concerned it's been an additional two
 
03:10:18.640 --> 03:10:19.510 align:start position:0%
concerned it's been an additional two
years

03:10:19.510 --> 03:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:10:21.429 --> 03:10:21.439 align:start position:0%
and the city hasn't been involved in any
 
03:10:23.750 --> 03:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
of this and it does have an impact i
 
03:10:26.309 --> 03:10:26.319 align:start position:0%
know that the state quite often doesn't
 
03:10:28.229 --> 03:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
think it does impact our city but it
 
03:10:28.239 --> 03:10:28.870 align:start position:0%
think it does impact our city but it
does

03:10:28.870 --> 03:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:10:31.590 --> 03:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm concerned that in two years time
 
03:10:33.190 --> 03:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
there's not been contact and they
 
03:10:35.030 --> 03:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
haven't been intimately involved
 
03:10:38.830 --> 03:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
with a 60-bed unit of um
 
03:10:42.309 --> 03:10:42.319 align:start position:0%
forensic mentally ill people
 
03:10:43.990 --> 03:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
and people coming in i understand the
 
03:10:46.389 --> 03:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
need for it but i also represent the
 
03:10:47.590 --> 03:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
city of concord
 
03:10:49.190 --> 03:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
where we have individuals and i'm very
 
03:10:51.590 --> 03:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
concerned that in two years time mr
 
03:10:51.600 --> 03:10:52.630 align:start position:0%
concerned that in two years time mr
chairman

03:10:52.630 --> 03:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:10:55.429 --> 03:10:55.439 align:start position:0%
the department hasn't found the need to
 
03:10:56.469 --> 03:10:56.479 align:start position:0%
do anything but
 
03:10:58.790 --> 03:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
think about reaching out so that's one
 
03:11:00.150 --> 03:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
thing that concerns me but it also
 
03:11:01.190 --> 03:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
concerns me
 
03:11:02.870 --> 03:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the questions were asking
 
03:11:05.030 --> 03:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
me here today were questions we asked
 
03:11:06.309 --> 03:11:06.319 align:start position:0%
two years ago
 
03:11:09.510 --> 03:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
and it started out as a 25 bed unit and
 
03:11:11.429 --> 03:11:11.439 align:start position:0%
now it's a 60 bed unit
 
03:11:14.070 --> 03:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
so um i have great concerns about this
 
03:11:14.080 --> 03:11:14.550 align:start position:0%
so um i have great concerns about this
project

03:11:14.550 --> 03:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
project
 
03:11:17.110 --> 03:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't two years ago it wasn't well
 
03:11:18.950 --> 03:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
planned out and it doesn't seem
 
03:11:20.469 --> 03:11:20.479 align:start position:0%
very well planned out now when they've
 
03:11:21.990 --> 03:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
had two years to work
 
03:11:24.070 --> 03:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
on design and everything else and it
 
03:11:27.670 --> 03:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem much has been done frankly
 
03:11:31.110 --> 03:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
okay so so thank you for those comments
 
03:11:31.120 --> 03:11:31.510 align:start position:0%
okay so so thank you for those comments
i

03:11:31.510 --> 03:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:11:34.630 --> 03:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
just to remind the committee today was
 
03:11:36.389 --> 03:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
scheduled to make sure that we
 
03:11:40.389 --> 03:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
we talked through uh this section and we
 
03:11:42.309 --> 03:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
weren't going to vote on it until
 
03:11:42.319 --> 03:11:43.510 align:start position:0%
weren't going to vote on it until
thursday

03:11:43.510 --> 03:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
thursday
 
03:11:45.910 --> 03:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
um in case there's follow-up issues and
 
03:11:46.870 --> 03:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
the like
 
03:11:50.229 --> 03:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh i i would i would like to share a
 
03:11:53.030 --> 03:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
con a part of a conversation i i that
 
03:11:55.110 --> 03:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative wallner and i had
 
03:11:57.269 --> 03:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
this weekend and representative walner
 
03:11:59.269 --> 03:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
if i if i misremember any of this
 
03:12:02.389 --> 03:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
please correct me
 
03:12:05.349 --> 03:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
but i i think when we talked about this
 
03:12:05.359 --> 03:12:05.910 align:start position:0%
but i i think when we talked about this
i

03:12:05.910 --> 03:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:12:09.510 --> 03:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
said that my my concerns uh around this
 
03:12:11.670 --> 03:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
is that this really feels like it needs
 
03:12:12.550 --> 03:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
to um
 
03:12:14.630 --> 03:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
go through the legislative process and
 
03:12:16.229 --> 03:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
have a full committee
 
03:12:19.190 --> 03:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
looking at it and a and a fiscal note
 
03:12:20.790 --> 03:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
attached to it
 
03:12:23.830 --> 03:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
and that and that we were we were
 
03:12:27.590 --> 03:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
doing a capital project in an hb2
 
03:12:30.229 --> 03:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
and that and and i'm the new guy so i
 
03:12:31.429 --> 03:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's
 
03:12:33.429 --> 03:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
a good thing to do or a bad thing but it
 
03:12:34.790 --> 03:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
feels to me like we have
 
03:12:37.990 --> 03:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
capital budgets for a reason
 
03:12:41.110 --> 03:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
and uh and this is looks like it may be
 
03:12:44.309 --> 03:12:44.319 align:start position:0%
circumventing that um so what
 
03:12:46.870 --> 03:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
what what i think i laid out to
 
03:12:48.389 --> 03:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
representative wallner was the
 
03:12:48.399 --> 03:12:50.469 align:start position:0%
representative wallner was the
possibility

03:12:50.469 --> 03:12:50.479 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
03:12:54.229 --> 03:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
of taking this out of hb2
 
03:12:57.670 --> 03:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
from the house version of it letting the
 
03:12:57.680 --> 03:12:58.630 align:start position:0%
from the house version of it letting the
senate

03:12:58.630 --> 03:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
senate
 
03:13:01.750 --> 03:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
work on their bill
 
03:13:04.550 --> 03:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
but meanwhile in early april our
 
03:13:04.560 --> 03:13:05.269 align:start position:0%
but meanwhile in early april our
committee

03:13:05.269 --> 03:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:13:09.429 --> 03:13:09.439 align:start position:0%
could have more of a of a hearing
 
03:13:13.110 --> 03:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
where we invite people in so we can
 
03:13:16.309 --> 03:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
so we can behave more like a committee a
 
03:13:17.750 --> 03:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
policy committee than just
 
03:13:20.950 --> 03:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
a finance committee so so that that was
 
03:13:23.110 --> 03:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
sort of one idea that got floated that's
 
03:13:24.950 --> 03:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
very different than what you said
 
03:13:26.950 --> 03:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
earlier representative weiler and i want
 
03:13:28.389 --> 03:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
to respect that
 
03:13:30.389 --> 03:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
and represent nordgren you don't have to
 
03:13:31.590 --> 03:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
take your hand down i
 
03:13:34.469 --> 03:13:34.479 align:start position:0%
i wasn't going to talk forever and you
 
03:13:38.710 --> 03:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:42.469 --> 03:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
you're on mute though
 
03:13:44.150 --> 03:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
you probably said everything i was
 
03:13:45.750 --> 03:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
already thinking i was
 
03:13:48.710 --> 03:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
thinking if nothing else we could remove
 
03:13:49.590 --> 03:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
this from
 
03:13:52.790 --> 03:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
our version of house bill 2 and then
 
03:13:54.790 --> 03:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
send it to the senate and hopefully we'd
 
03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
have more information
 
03:13:59.429 --> 03:13:59.439 align:start position:0%
on how to proceed but i think you're on
 
03:14:00.950 --> 03:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
the right track
 
03:14:03.750 --> 03:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
thanks all right representative wallner
 
03:14:05.990 --> 03:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
since i was signing our conversation was
 
03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:06.550 align:start position:0%
since i was signing our conversation was
i

03:14:06.550 --> 03:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:14:10.070 --> 03:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
i missed something
 
03:14:12.229 --> 03:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
no i think that that pretty much summed
 
03:14:13.269 --> 03:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
it up i
 
03:14:15.670 --> 03:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
i was excited when i saw that the senate
 
03:14:15.680 --> 03:14:16.469 align:start position:0%
i was excited when i saw that the senate
had

03:14:16.469 --> 03:14:16.479 align:start position:0%
had
 
03:14:19.670 --> 03:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
was i did have a bill and that the bill
 
03:14:19.680 --> 03:14:21.190 align:start position:0%
was i did have a bill and that the bill
actually

03:14:21.190 --> 03:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:14:24.309 --> 03:14:24.319 align:start position:0%
um matched sort of what was in
 
03:14:27.429 --> 03:14:27.439 align:start position:0%
what was in the budget from la from two
 
03:14:28.389 --> 03:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
03:14:30.710 --> 03:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
but they have re-referred it they're
 
03:14:32.630 --> 03:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
they're holding on to it
 
03:14:34.630 --> 03:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
so i there's obviously going to be a
 
03:14:36.229 --> 03:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
time when the senate and the house are
 
03:14:38.469 --> 03:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
going to be able to talk about this
 
03:14:41.830 --> 03:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
so possibly holding an information
 
03:14:41.840 --> 03:14:42.710 align:start position:0%
so possibly holding an information
session

03:14:42.710 --> 03:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:14:45.830 --> 03:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
later on in april when we have more time
 
03:14:47.830 --> 03:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
i think that i think there's merit to
 
03:14:47.840 --> 03:14:49.469 align:start position:0%
i think that i think there's merit to
that

03:14:49.469 --> 03:14:49.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:14:51.429 --> 03:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
representative and your hand was up and
 
03:14:53.429 --> 03:14:53.439 align:start position:0%
down down did you do you have another
 
03:14:53.439 --> 03:14:54.630 align:start position:0%
down down did you do you have another
comment

03:14:54.630 --> 03:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
comment
 
03:14:57.670 --> 03:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
no representative weiler since what i
 
03:14:59.190 --> 03:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
said kind of contradicts what
 
03:15:02.309 --> 03:15:02.319 align:start position:0%
what you were recommending i what are
 
03:15:05.269 --> 03:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:07.110 --> 03:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
probably that'll work the way you the
 
03:15:09.110 --> 03:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
way you propose and i think that
 
03:15:12.469 --> 03:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
i think um representative walner
 
03:15:15.429 --> 03:15:15.439 align:start position:0%
uh considers it the same and i we've got
 
03:15:16.150 --> 03:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
enough time
 
03:15:18.469 --> 03:15:18.479 align:start position:0%
before we have a deadline i just wanted
 
03:15:21.030 --> 03:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
to move it along because i thought
 
03:15:22.870 --> 03:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
but your plan would move it along one
 
03:15:24.469 --> 03:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
way or the other so i would
 
03:15:28.150 --> 03:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
go with that okay
 
03:15:31.670 --> 03:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
okay so so what i what i think
 
03:15:34.710 --> 03:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
we'll do on thursday and and this will
 
03:15:37.110 --> 03:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
give people a chance to think about it
 
03:15:40.790 --> 03:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
and i think we'll probably have a motion
 
03:15:43.990 --> 03:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
to vote to remove section 39 of our
 
03:15:46.469 --> 03:15:46.479 align:start position:0%
version of house bill 2
 
03:15:49.750 --> 03:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
with the idea that we would uh begin
 
03:15:54.550 --> 03:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
scheduling a more of a policy committee
 
03:15:58.790 --> 03:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh review of this um
 
03:16:01.750 --> 03:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
in early april so that our committee can
 
03:16:01.760 --> 03:16:01.990 align:start position:0%
in early april so that our committee can
get

03:16:01.990 --> 03:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
get
 
03:16:05.030 --> 03:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
smarter about this and get ready to give
 
03:16:06.790 --> 03:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
some of that information to the senate
 
03:16:08.229 --> 03:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
if they don't already have it
 
03:16:11.510 --> 03:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
with their hearings on sb 156
 
03:16:14.229 --> 03:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
or alternatively make us smarter so
 
03:16:15.349 --> 03:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
we're prepared for
 
03:16:19.510 --> 03:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:21.349 --> 03:16:21.359 align:start position:0%
that that's what i think we might vote
 
03:16:23.429 --> 03:16:23.439 align:start position:0%
on on monday
 
03:16:26.710 --> 03:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:29.030 --> 03:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
are there are there any comments mr
 
03:16:29.990 --> 03:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
ripple what what what
 
03:16:32.710 --> 03:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
do you you're being quiet as you
 
03:16:34.150 --> 03:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
normally do in this phase of the
 
03:16:35.990 --> 03:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
conversation but i'm curious what you're
 
03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:37.670 align:start position:0%
conversation but i'm curious what you're
thinking

03:16:37.670 --> 03:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
03:16:40.309 --> 03:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
no i think that's fine um i would just
 
03:16:40.319 --> 03:16:40.710 align:start position:0%
no i think that's fine um i would just
know

03:16:40.710 --> 03:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:16:42.389 --> 03:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
two things one you do have one hand up
 
03:16:43.830 --> 03:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
in the audience if you if you want to
 
03:16:45.110 --> 03:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
hear from that person
 
03:16:48.550 --> 03:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
and another if you vote to uh remove it
 
03:16:50.870 --> 03:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think it would just be a vote to
 
03:16:52.630 --> 03:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
remove as you've been voting to
 
03:16:54.309 --> 03:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
approve so far you would actually need
 
03:16:56.309 --> 03:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
an amendment that removes that section
 
03:16:59.349 --> 03:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
but we can have that all right
 
03:17:01.670 --> 03:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
so so let's go to represent a weiler and
 
03:17:03.670 --> 03:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
then and don't let me forget we got a
 
03:17:09.990 --> 03:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:12.870 --> 03:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
took your hand down i would suggest that
 
03:17:12.880 --> 03:17:13.269 align:start position:0%
took your hand down i would suggest that
the

03:17:13.269 --> 03:17:13.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:17:15.830 --> 03:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
motion or the amendment to remove it is
 
03:17:18.070 --> 03:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
for further discussion
 
03:17:20.790 --> 03:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know so that it's obvious we
 
03:17:20.800 --> 03:17:21.349 align:start position:0%
uh you know so that it's obvious we
haven't

03:17:21.349 --> 03:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
03:17:22.790 --> 03:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
killed it we're just removing it for
 
03:17:24.710 --> 03:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
further discussion that's all
 
03:17:27.990 --> 03:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
 
03:17:29.910 --> 03:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
you want to bring in whoever our guest
 
03:17:32.550 --> 03:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
is that wants to speak on this
 
03:17:32.560 --> 03:17:39.190 align:start position:0%
is that wants to speak on this
sure

03:17:39.190 --> 03:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:41.750 --> 03:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chair uh mike skivy
 
03:17:43.349 --> 03:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
from the disability rights center
 
03:17:45.110 --> 03:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to make a couple of
 
03:17:46.870 --> 03:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
quick comments um
 
03:17:50.630 --> 03:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
i think um the 25 bed census amount
 
03:17:52.790 --> 03:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
made a lot of sense when it was in the
 
03:17:54.469 --> 03:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
last budget or should i say the current
 
03:17:54.479 --> 03:17:55.830 align:start position:0%
last budget or should i say the current
budget

03:17:55.830 --> 03:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:17:58.309 --> 03:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
because that basically covers the
 
03:18:00.150 --> 03:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
civilly committed population that has
 
03:18:02.070 --> 03:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
now been transferred to
 
03:18:03.910 --> 03:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
the secure psychiatric unit i think
 
03:18:06.790 --> 03:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
there's pretty general
 
03:18:09.910 --> 03:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
consensus that that census amount would
 
03:18:11.269 --> 03:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
take care of
 
03:18:13.429 --> 03:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
basically removing people from the
 
03:18:15.750 --> 03:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
prison who have not been sentenced
 
03:18:19.830 --> 03:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
um but are more properly in a more
 
03:18:23.190 --> 03:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
civilly um appropriate therapeutic
 
03:18:26.389 --> 03:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
environment i think that if you do go
 
03:18:29.750 --> 03:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
up to 60 then you are definitely
 
03:18:33.269 --> 03:18:33.279 align:start position:0%
creating a net increase in your
 
03:18:35.670 --> 03:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
hospital capacity and i think there's
 
03:18:38.229 --> 03:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
pretty good evidence that you don't
 
03:18:40.630 --> 03:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
have a problem of bed capacity you have
 
03:18:42.309 --> 03:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
a problem of
 
03:18:45.349 --> 03:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
of using your bed capacity basically to
 
03:18:47.349 --> 03:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
house people who are ready for discharge
 
03:18:48.550 --> 03:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
i think that you've probably already
 
03:18:51.750 --> 03:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
heard from a number of people that
 
03:18:53.429 --> 03:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
you've got about half your beds at new
 
03:18:54.870 --> 03:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital are being held by
 
03:18:55.910 --> 03:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
people who are ready for
 
03:18:58.790 --> 03:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
for discharge and i think that that's a
 
03:19:00.469 --> 03:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
problem that you're not going to build
 
03:19:00.479 --> 03:19:00.870 align:start position:0%
problem that you're not going to build
your

03:19:00.870 --> 03:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:19:02.950 --> 03:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
your way out of here you need to deal
 
03:19:04.550 --> 03:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
with that problem with
 
03:19:07.269 --> 03:19:07.279 align:start position:0%
a much less expensive enhancement to the
 
03:19:09.030 --> 03:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
mental health system which is to create
 
03:19:09.040 --> 03:19:09.670 align:start position:0%
mental health system which is to create
discharge

03:19:09.670 --> 03:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
discharge
 
03:19:12.070 --> 03:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
destinations for those people and to
 
03:19:13.830 --> 03:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
create supports in the community so that
 
03:19:15.830 --> 03:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
they don't need to come back
 
03:19:16.950 --> 03:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly after they were
 
03:19:16.960 --> 03:19:19.990 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly after they were
discharged

03:19:19.990 --> 03:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:23.750 --> 03:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
may i ask you a question sir certainly
 
03:19:26.469 --> 03:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
um do you think your organization or you
 
03:19:27.269 --> 03:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
have had an
 
03:19:30.710 --> 03:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to fully provide testimony
 
03:19:30.720 --> 03:19:31.269 align:start position:0%
opportunity to fully provide testimony
to

03:19:31.269 --> 03:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:19:34.790 --> 03:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
a policy committee on this topic
 
03:19:37.110 --> 03:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
it's never been before a policy
 
03:19:38.710 --> 03:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
committee but i certainly
 
03:19:40.630 --> 03:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
spoke at some length on a couple of
 
03:19:42.550 --> 03:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
different occasions
 
03:19:45.750 --> 03:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
before division three and the full house
 
03:19:47.349 --> 03:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
03:19:48.710 --> 03:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
when the current budget was being
 
03:19:51.030 --> 03:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
prepared and it was after
 
03:19:54.229 --> 03:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
that sort of back and forth that the
 
03:19:57.830 --> 03:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh that the current provision was
 
03:20:00.150 --> 03:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
adopted which provided for 25 beds which
 
03:20:01.510 --> 03:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
basically takes care of the
 
03:20:03.110 --> 03:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
the actual problem which is that you've
 
03:20:05.190 --> 03:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
got people at the secure psychiatric
 
03:20:06.229 --> 03:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
unit that shouldn't be
 
03:20:09.030 --> 03:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
in that environment but i'd be happy to
 
03:20:10.950 --> 03:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
go over that
 
03:20:13.190 --> 03:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
those issues again i'm basically my
 
03:20:15.110 --> 03:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
testimony would reference
 
03:20:18.309 --> 03:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
independent assessments of the problem
 
03:20:19.110 --> 03:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
03:20:21.750 --> 03:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
one of which was a report in 2017 that
 
03:20:22.870 --> 03:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
was commissioned by the department
 
03:20:22.880 --> 03:20:24.070 align:start position:0%
was commissioned by the department
itself

03:20:24.070 --> 03:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
itself
 
03:20:27.670 --> 03:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
and another is the the periodic reports
 
03:20:31.190 --> 03:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
of the expert reviewer who analyzes
 
03:20:33.030 --> 03:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
whether the state is in compliance with
 
03:20:36.630 --> 03:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:39.190 --> 03:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
okay so i do have one other question for
 
03:20:39.200 --> 03:20:40.070 align:start position:0%
okay so i do have one other question for
you

03:20:40.070 --> 03:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:20:43.110 --> 03:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
i i understand your point about
 
03:20:47.030 --> 03:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
going from 25 to 60 with that 35
 
03:20:50.469 --> 03:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
bed extra capacity it would probably
 
03:20:51.750 --> 03:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
still get filled up
 
03:20:53.070 --> 03:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the
 
03:20:55.349 --> 03:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
community-based alternatives to
 
03:20:55.359 --> 03:20:56.070 align:start position:0%
community-based alternatives to
discharge

03:20:56.070 --> 03:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
discharge
 
03:20:59.910 --> 03:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
people into but but wouldn't that 35
 
03:21:03.750 --> 03:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
also though absorb more people and get
 
03:21:05.830 --> 03:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
more people out of the emergency room
 
03:21:05.840 --> 03:21:08.309 align:start position:0%
more people out of the emergency room
warehousing

03:21:08.309 --> 03:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
warehousing
 
03:21:11.349 --> 03:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
i i think that the dynamic is one that
 
03:21:12.710 --> 03:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
we've seen repeatedly
 
03:21:16.309 --> 03:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
um which is that um
 
03:21:19.269 --> 03:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
when you take out um people from the
 
03:21:20.870 --> 03:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
hospital it's basically the same thing
 
03:21:22.710 --> 03:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
as adding a bed right and so we've done
 
03:21:23.990 --> 03:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
that before we've
 
03:21:26.630 --> 03:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
we've created transitional housing and
 
03:21:28.790 --> 03:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
transferred a couple of dozen people at
 
03:21:28.800 --> 03:21:29.750 align:start position:0%
transferred a couple of dozen people at
times

03:21:29.750 --> 03:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
times
 
03:21:32.150 --> 03:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
out of new hampshire hospital but that
 
03:21:34.309 --> 03:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
but those beds don't remain in play they
 
03:21:34.319 --> 03:21:34.870 align:start position:0%
but those beds don't remain in play they
basically

03:21:34.870 --> 03:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
basically
 
03:21:36.710 --> 03:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
get filled up again by people who are
 
03:21:37.990 --> 03:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
not ready for discharge
 
03:21:40.950 --> 03:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
but are put i'm sorry that are not that
 
03:21:42.309 --> 03:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
are ready for discharge but don't have a
 
03:21:44.150 --> 03:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
place to go and and we've seen it most
 
03:21:45.910 --> 03:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
recently with the creation of the 16
 
03:21:47.990 --> 03:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
transitional housing unit
 
03:21:50.950 --> 03:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh beds um on the campus at the old
 
03:21:52.070 --> 03:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
philbrick center
 
03:21:54.070 --> 03:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
i mean i think probably the most helpful
 
03:21:55.830 --> 03:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
analogy is a simple one but i think it
 
03:21:55.840 --> 03:21:56.550 align:start position:0%
analogy is a simple one but i think it
applies

03:21:56.550 --> 03:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
applies
 
03:22:00.229 --> 03:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
is that you know if if you have you know
 
03:22:03.590 --> 03:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
a bathtub of a particular capacity
 
03:22:05.349 --> 03:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
that keeps overflowing because your
 
03:22:06.710 --> 03:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
drain is running fast
 
03:22:09.269 --> 03:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
is running more slowly than your faucet
 
03:22:09.279 --> 03:22:10.229 align:start position:0%
is running more slowly than your faucet
is

03:22:10.229 --> 03:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:22:13.190 --> 03:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
then you can take a few buckets of water
 
03:22:14.870 --> 03:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
out of that bathtub and it'll stop
 
03:22:16.070 --> 03:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
overflowing but only
 
03:22:19.030 --> 03:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
only for a brief period of time before
 
03:22:19.590 --> 03:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
03:22:21.510 --> 03:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
the inherent problem with your system
 
03:22:23.269 --> 03:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
which is that the drain isn't running
 
03:22:24.309 --> 03:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
fast enough
 
03:22:25.990 --> 03:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
to keep up with the faucet is going to
 
03:22:28.070 --> 03:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
overcome the capacity again and the same
 
03:22:29.269 --> 03:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
thing would happen
 
03:22:32.550 --> 03:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
if you added a net of 35 beds to
 
03:22:34.550 --> 03:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital if you don't have
 
03:22:36.309 --> 03:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
places to discharge people
 
03:22:37.830 --> 03:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
then you're going to fill up those beds
 
03:22:39.349 --> 03:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
again and you're still going to have
 
03:22:40.389 --> 03:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
this problem
 
03:22:42.469 --> 03:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
i mean we've we've had a net increase in
 
03:22:44.229 --> 03:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
beds over the last couple of years in
 
03:22:45.269 --> 03:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
03:22:46.950 --> 03:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
and we've got a larger boarding
 
03:22:48.790 --> 03:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
population today than we did
 
03:22:50.550 --> 03:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
you know 12 months ago and maybe two
 
03:22:52.550 --> 03:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
years ago i i'm not exactly sure what
 
03:22:54.469 --> 03:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
the count is compared to 24 months ago
 
03:22:56.229 --> 03:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
but we've definitely seen
 
03:22:59.349 --> 03:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
those two those two
 
03:23:01.590 --> 03:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
things running in opposite directions in
 
03:23:02.790 --> 03:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
recent months
 
03:23:04.870 --> 03:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
and so i think that's because of what i
 
03:23:06.630 --> 03:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
said which is that your problem
 
03:23:08.309 --> 03:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
is that you you're not discharging
 
03:23:09.830 --> 03:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
people as quickly as you're admitting
 
03:23:09.840 --> 03:23:10.229 align:start position:0%
people as quickly as you're admitting
them

03:23:10.229 --> 03:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:23:11.670 --> 03:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
and so you've got people backed up at
 
03:23:13.269 --> 03:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
the front door
 
03:23:16.710 --> 03:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you uh
 
03:23:18.229 --> 03:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
representative erf do you have a
 
03:23:20.790 --> 03:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
question for mr skibby or or just
 
03:23:22.710 --> 03:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
in general no no i do have a question
 
03:23:24.150 --> 03:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
for him yes
 
03:23:26.710 --> 03:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like you're saying the
 
03:23:27.590 --> 03:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
problem can't be
 
03:23:31.110 --> 03:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
solved um so what is the solution
 
03:23:31.990 --> 03:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
because that as
 
03:23:34.070 --> 03:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
i was listening to you two years ago
 
03:23:35.830 --> 03:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
that's why i recall the whole
 
03:23:37.349 --> 03:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
conversation about transitional housing
 
03:23:38.870 --> 03:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
and as you say
 
03:23:42.710 --> 03:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's some of it has been built um
 
03:23:44.469 --> 03:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
but if that hasn't helped solve the
 
03:23:47.190 --> 03:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
problem what is the solution
 
03:23:49.510 --> 03:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
well transitional housing if it's used
 
03:23:51.030 --> 03:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
truly to transition
 
03:23:53.030 --> 03:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
that is somebody is there very briefly
 
03:23:54.469 --> 03:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
before they're
 
03:23:58.469 --> 03:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
moved into a more permanent
 
03:24:00.229 --> 03:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
living situation in the community then
 
03:24:02.229 --> 03:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
transitional housing can be part of the
 
03:24:02.239 --> 03:24:03.349 align:start position:0%
transitional housing can be part of the
solution

03:24:03.349 --> 03:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
solution
 
03:24:05.110 --> 03:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
but the real solution is that you get
 
03:24:07.349 --> 03:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
people out into the community
 
03:24:10.950 --> 03:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
to permanent places to live and you keep
 
03:24:11.750 --> 03:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
them stable
 
03:24:13.590 --> 03:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
in those permanent places so they don't
 
03:24:16.630 --> 03:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
show up at the front door again
 
03:24:18.630 --> 03:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
i certainly didn't mean to say that the
 
03:24:20.550 --> 03:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
problem can't be solved the problem can
 
03:24:22.229 --> 03:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
be solved by coming into compliance with
 
03:24:23.429 --> 03:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
the mental health agreement
 
03:24:25.190 --> 03:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
that is by providing the community
 
03:24:26.710 --> 03:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
supports that the state agreed to
 
03:24:26.720 --> 03:24:28.150 align:start position:0%
supports that the state agreed to
provide

03:24:28.150 --> 03:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
provide
 
03:24:29.590 --> 03:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
because we know that when you do that
 
03:24:31.030 --> 03:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
people don't show up at your front door
 
03:24:31.040 --> 03:24:31.830 align:start position:0%
people don't show up at your front door
again

03:24:31.830 --> 03:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:24:34.950 --> 03:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
and also by providing other supported
 
03:24:34.960 --> 03:24:36.150 align:start position:0%
and also by providing other supported
housing

03:24:36.150 --> 03:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
housing
 
03:24:38.550 --> 03:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
that keeps people permanently and more
 
03:24:41.190 --> 03:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
stably living in the community
 
03:24:43.110 --> 03:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
you can you can keep building beds and
 
03:24:44.229 --> 03:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
eventually you'll have
 
03:24:47.030 --> 03:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
every mental health patient um in an
 
03:24:49.110 --> 03:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
inpatient facility and you'll stop
 
03:24:50.550 --> 03:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
you know having them in the middle in
 
03:24:52.229 --> 03:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
the emergency rooms but you're going to
 
03:24:53.990 --> 03:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
be talking about a lot more than 35 beds
 
03:24:56.150 --> 03:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
before you solve it that way the way you
 
03:24:57.429 --> 03:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
need to solve it is that you need to
 
03:24:59.190 --> 03:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
have your throughput working that is you
 
03:24:59.200 --> 03:24:59.590 align:start position:0%
have your throughput working that is you
have

03:24:59.590 --> 03:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:25:01.190 --> 03:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
all of your beds filled with people who
 
03:25:03.429 --> 03:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
need an inpatient level of care
 
03:25:04.950 --> 03:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
not have half of them filled with people
 
03:25:06.790 --> 03:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
who are basically living there
 
03:25:13.030 --> 03:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:16.309 --> 03:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
are there other questions from mr skibby
 
03:25:20.790 --> 03:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:24.150 --> 03:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
okay i'm i'm not i'm not seeing any
 
03:25:27.990 --> 03:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
um i i have a question for you mr ripple
 
03:25:31.030 --> 03:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
and maybe for uh chairman weiler too
 
03:25:34.710 --> 03:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
do do we do we think we have
 
03:25:37.030 --> 03:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
finance committee obligations the whole
 
03:25:37.040 --> 03:25:37.830 align:start position:0%
finance committee obligations the whole
committee

03:25:37.830 --> 03:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:25:41.429 --> 03:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
on april 5th or 6th that's monday or
 
03:25:43.190 --> 03:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
tuesday before our three-day
 
03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:49.429 --> 03:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any just take a quick
 
03:25:51.990 --> 03:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
look at the calendar here
 
03:25:54.630 --> 03:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if we should block or or
 
03:25:57.269 --> 03:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
if division three should anticipate that
 
03:26:00.550 --> 03:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
monday or tuesday the fifth or sixth if
 
03:26:03.750 --> 03:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
if those are full finance days or if we
 
03:26:03.760 --> 03:26:04.070 align:start position:0%
if those are full finance days or if we
could

03:26:04.070 --> 03:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:26:07.990 --> 03:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
maybe hold a public hearing on
 
03:26:11.510 --> 03:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
on this hp i think i i doubt you would
 
03:26:13.030 --> 03:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
have i doubt full finance would have
 
03:26:14.710 --> 03:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
anything going on on those days since
 
03:26:14.720 --> 03:26:15.030 align:start position:0%
anything going on on those days since
it's

03:26:15.030 --> 03:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:26:22.150 --> 03:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:26.070 --> 03:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
do you agree there chairman weiler
 
03:26:27.590 --> 03:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
yes i think we could we could have a
 
03:26:29.590 --> 03:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
hearing or maybe even before the full
 
03:26:29.600 --> 03:26:31.830 align:start position:0%
hearing or maybe even before the full
committee

03:26:31.830 --> 03:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:26:33.510 --> 03:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
you want the full finance committee
 
03:26:35.590 --> 03:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
maybe on this well
 
03:26:38.710 --> 03:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
if it worked best for the schedule
 
03:26:42.309 --> 03:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
okay so so um just i'm just looking for
 
03:26:43.269 --> 03:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
a sense of uh
 
03:26:45.429 --> 03:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
division three is the monday or the
 
03:26:45.439 --> 03:26:46.710 align:start position:0%
division three is the monday or the
tuesday

03:26:46.710 --> 03:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
tuesday
 
03:26:48.710 --> 03:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
the fifth or the sixth better we could
 
03:26:50.950 --> 03:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead and try to start a scheduling
 
03:26:50.960 --> 03:26:51.349 align:start position:0%
go ahead and try to start a scheduling
to

03:26:51.349 --> 03:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:26:55.030 --> 03:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:59.110 --> 03:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative i i was just
 
03:27:02.070 --> 03:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
gonna check with um representative
 
03:27:02.080 --> 03:27:02.950 align:start position:0%
gonna check with um representative
weiler

03:27:02.950 --> 03:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
weiler
 
03:27:04.950 --> 03:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
what day will you be doing the briefing
 
03:27:09.750 --> 03:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:13.269 --> 03:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
i haven't really scheduled that yet i
 
03:27:19.590 --> 03:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:21.670 --> 03:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
the only thing that bothers me about
 
03:27:24.229 --> 03:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
doing it on that monday or tuesday
 
03:27:26.469 --> 03:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
when on wednesday you're going to have
 
03:27:28.150 --> 03:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
the budget on the floor
 
03:27:30.150 --> 03:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
right and there's a lot of preparation
 
03:27:30.160 --> 03:27:31.349 align:start position:0%
right and there's a lot of preparation
work

03:27:31.349 --> 03:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:27:33.750 --> 03:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
people have to do to get to get ready
 
03:27:35.670 --> 03:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
for that i just
 
03:27:37.429 --> 03:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
i mean those seem like to me like dave
 
03:27:39.110 --> 03:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
you might have caucuses
 
03:27:42.630 --> 03:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
you might be briefing your caucus we'd
 
03:27:44.710 --> 03:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
be briefing hours i just
 
03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
so let's let's jump ahead and assume
 
03:27:48.070 --> 03:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely
 
03:27:50.870 --> 03:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
correct should it then seems like we
 
03:27:51.830 --> 03:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
should go ahead
 
03:27:54.389 --> 03:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
and wait until the 12th or 13th that
 
03:27:55.990 --> 03:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
monday or tuesday
 
03:27:59.190 --> 03:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
to get it past our house sessions
 
03:28:03.349 --> 03:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
so so of those days the 12th or the 13th
 
03:28:05.750 --> 03:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
monday or tuesday is there a sense of
 
03:28:07.429 --> 03:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
what the division would prefer i
 
03:28:11.510 --> 03:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't care so if anyone has a
 
03:28:11.520 --> 03:28:12.630 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't care so if anyone has a
strong

03:28:12.630 --> 03:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
strong
 
03:28:14.950 --> 03:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know don't do it on this day this is
 
03:28:18.070 --> 03:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
a good time to speak up
 
03:28:20.870 --> 03:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
well i was i was kind of waiting for the
 
03:28:23.190 --> 03:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
divisions to finish
 
03:28:26.070 --> 03:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
before i i tried to schedule the full
 
03:28:27.349 --> 03:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
committee and i was hoping that would
 
03:28:27.359 --> 03:28:28.469 align:start position:0%
committee and i was hoping that would
happen

03:28:28.469 --> 03:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
happen
 
03:28:30.630 --> 03:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
you know within the week i could
 
03:28:32.229 --> 03:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
possibly have it
 
03:28:34.790 --> 03:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
like the end of march or even the first
 
03:28:34.800 --> 03:28:35.269 align:start position:0%
like the end of march or even the first
of

03:28:35.269 --> 03:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:28:39.190 --> 03:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
april yes yes sir i i think if we move
 
03:28:41.190 --> 03:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about the review of
 
03:28:42.630 --> 03:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
this house bill
 
03:28:46.070 --> 03:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
yes section 39 to the 12th of the 13th
 
03:28:47.349 --> 03:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
to april though
 
03:28:49.510 --> 03:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
we're just clearing the deck for you to
 
03:28:51.269 --> 03:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
pick when you need to pick
 
03:28:53.429 --> 03:28:53.439 align:start position:0%
and then we're also giving room for
 
03:28:55.429 --> 03:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
representative walner's concept that
 
03:28:57.269 --> 03:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of homework to get ready
 
03:28:59.429 --> 03:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
to talk to the full house
 
03:29:02.630 --> 03:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
so correct yeah okay
 
03:29:06.150 --> 03:29:06.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm not hearing anyone complain about
 
03:29:07.110 --> 03:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
either the 12th
 
03:29:10.150 --> 03:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
or the 13th may i
 
03:29:13.429 --> 03:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
offer a piece of information yes ma'am i
 
03:29:15.510 --> 03:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
do believe that the senate finance is
 
03:29:17.590 --> 03:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
going to start meeting on the 12th
 
03:29:19.269 --> 03:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that they're likely to
 
03:29:21.110 --> 03:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
meet until the afternoon though
 
03:29:23.590 --> 03:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
so maybe in the morning of the 12th
 
03:29:24.229 --> 03:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
might be
 
03:29:27.269 --> 03:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
an option i think the house finance
 
03:29:28.389 --> 03:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
presents to
 
03:29:30.950 --> 03:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
senate finance on the 12th potentially
 
03:29:33.510 --> 03:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
but not till the afternoon
 
03:29:37.429 --> 03:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
okay whatever we find on this house bill
 
03:29:37.439 --> 03:29:37.750 align:start position:0%
okay whatever we find on this house bill
2

03:29:37.750 --> 03:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
2
 
03:29:40.469 --> 03:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
item i i i don't know how it works i
 
03:29:41.190 --> 03:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
think we'll
 
03:29:43.110 --> 03:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
be informally communicating to the
 
03:29:45.190 --> 03:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
senate in any case but
 
03:29:48.389 --> 03:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
or through kevin except kevin can't be
 
03:29:50.389 --> 03:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
in two places at once maybe that's what
 
03:29:51.590 --> 03:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
03:29:54.150 --> 03:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh mr ripple are you do you know what
 
03:29:56.070 --> 03:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
you're doing on the 12th
 
03:29:57.830 --> 03:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
i'm taking a look at the senate calendar
 
03:29:59.269 --> 03:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
now um
 
03:30:00.830 --> 03:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
so no off the top of my head i'm not
 
03:30:03.269 --> 03:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
sure okay
 
03:30:06.309 --> 03:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
so if you would take a note to maybe
 
03:30:07.030 --> 03:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
pencil us
 
03:30:09.830 --> 03:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
in for monday the 12th in the morning on
 
03:30:11.910 --> 03:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
the idea that the senate finance people
 
03:30:14.309 --> 03:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
won't start till the afternoon
 
03:30:16.150 --> 03:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
then we can have a morning hearing on
 
03:30:18.630 --> 03:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
section 39.
 
03:30:18.640 --> 03:30:22.070 align:start position:0%
section 39.
okay

03:30:22.070 --> 03:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:23.910 --> 03:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
all right and then i think we would like
 
03:30:26.070 --> 03:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
to on thursday
 
03:30:29.590 --> 03:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
have a vote of division three
 
03:30:32.950 --> 03:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
on an amendment to strip section 39
 
03:30:36.309 --> 03:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
out of house bill 2.
 
03:30:37.910 --> 03:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
do i need to give you something in
 
03:30:40.150 --> 03:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
writing for that
 
03:30:41.750 --> 03:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
no you don't we can just have it drafted
 
03:30:44.229 --> 03:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
to remove that section
 
03:30:47.349 --> 03:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
okay so representative wallner since
 
03:30:49.190 --> 03:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
this was your topic today
 
03:30:51.429 --> 03:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
are you satisfied with where we're at
 
03:30:54.309 --> 03:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:57.269 --> 03:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
yes i i like the idea of us having a a
 
03:30:59.269 --> 03:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
more open discussion where public can
 
03:31:00.150 --> 03:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
come in where
 
03:31:01.910 --> 03:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
other people can come in and talk to us
 
03:31:03.990 --> 03:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
about this i think it's a good i think
 
03:31:05.670 --> 03:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
it's good
 
03:31:08.950 --> 03:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
okay good good good good
 
03:31:14.150 --> 03:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh with that representative earth
 
03:31:17.190 --> 03:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
why don't you have us why don't you
 
03:31:18.469 --> 03:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
educate us
 
03:31:20.870 --> 03:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
tell us what you've done with house bill
 
03:31:20.880 --> 03:31:21.830 align:start position:0%
tell us what you've done with house bill
1

03:31:21.830 --> 03:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
1
 
03:31:25.910 --> 03:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:27.910 --> 03:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
does anyone need a break a few minutes
 
03:31:29.670 --> 03:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
break before we get into that
 
03:31:31.910 --> 03:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
i i think i actually could take a minute
 
03:31:33.750 --> 03:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
or two
 
03:31:36.950 --> 03:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
so so while you and mr ripple get
 
03:31:39.349 --> 03:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
ready um i'm going to step away for a
 
03:31:40.550 --> 03:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
few moments
 
03:31:40.560 --> 03:31:44.389 align:start position:0%
few moments
okay

03:31:44.389 --> 03:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:47.030 --> 03:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
go go ahead uh representative weiler
 
03:31:48.389 --> 03:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
what what
 
03:31:51.190 --> 03:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
they they would like me to appear at
 
03:31:53.510 --> 03:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
edna at three o'clock i'm still not sure
 
03:31:53.990 --> 03:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
for what
 
03:31:54.000 --> 03:31:57.110 align:start position:0%
for what
but

03:31:57.110 --> 03:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:59.269 --> 03:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
step away a few minutes before yes sir i
 
03:32:01.269 --> 03:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
think we're gonna be down before three
 
03:32:06.070 --> 03:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:09.110 --> 03:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
so kevin if you could bring up the draft
 
03:32:10.710 --> 03:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
funding analysis budget that's dated
 
03:32:10.720 --> 03:32:12.150 align:start position:0%
funding analysis budget that's dated
today

03:32:12.150 --> 03:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:32:19.510 --> 03:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:22.630 --> 03:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
and everybody should have a copy of it
 
03:32:24.229 --> 03:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
that i sent out
 
03:32:46.150 --> 03:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:48.309 --> 03:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
can you all see that okay it seems kind
 
03:32:52.229 --> 03:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:55.429 --> 03:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:58.550 --> 03:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
but my original is very clear yeah
 
03:33:00.229 --> 03:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i'm not sure if there's
 
03:33:01.510 --> 03:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
anything i can do anything about that
 
03:33:04.229 --> 03:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
because it does look clear on my screen
 
03:33:06.630 --> 03:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
okay can you maybe blow it up a little
 
03:33:07.510 --> 03:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
bit then
 
03:33:11.269 --> 03:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
i might have a little there you go
 
03:33:19.429 --> 03:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
oh it's better that's better kevin okay
 
03:33:21.030 --> 03:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
now you don't have to go too far yeah
 
03:33:22.309 --> 03:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
most of them even talking about kevin is
 
03:33:22.790 --> 03:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
at the top
 
03:33:43.590 --> 03:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:47.429 --> 03:33:47.439 align:start position:0%
okay so so i'm back
 
03:33:51.030 --> 03:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh harry's not here
 
03:33:54.309 --> 03:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren's not here
 
03:33:58.830 --> 03:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
there's there's there's representative
 
03:34:01.510 --> 03:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
bean so we found a bean in
 
03:34:03.590 --> 03:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that's not related to you
 
03:34:03.600 --> 03:34:07.910 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that's not related to you
harry

03:34:07.910 --> 03:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:14.950 --> 03:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't bet on that yet
 
03:34:16.790 --> 03:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay i think we should wait for
 
03:34:18.550 --> 03:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren before
 
03:34:26.830 --> 03:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:26.840 --> 03:34:30.950 align:start position:0%
 
problem

03:34:30.950 --> 03:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:34.710 --> 03:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:38.070 --> 03:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
i do i can't read it but i can see it
 
03:34:41.670 --> 03:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
john bean or jim bean or john bean
 
03:34:44.710 --> 03:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
move it to your left a little there you
 
03:34:44.720 --> 03:34:46.710 align:start position:0%
move it to your left a little there you
go

03:34:46.710 --> 03:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
go
 
03:34:50.469 --> 03:34:50.479 align:start position:0%
from exeter see how thick that is
 
03:34:54.790 --> 03:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:56.550 --> 03:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
that's why it takes me a while to figure
 
03:34:57.990 --> 03:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
out if she's actually in there but she's
 
03:35:00.070 --> 03:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
probably married to
 
03:35:01.750 --> 03:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
as probably her married name as a guest
 
03:35:09.349 --> 03:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:12.630 --> 03:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
have you have you sent out uh keith have
 
03:35:14.070 --> 03:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
you sent out
 
03:35:17.349 --> 03:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
the uh the line by line that you used to
 
03:35:21.510 --> 03:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
build this i have kind of yeah
 
03:35:23.830 --> 03:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
intentionally but i did send it out when
 
03:35:25.190 --> 03:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
i meant to send this out so they have
 
03:35:25.200 --> 03:35:26.309 align:start position:0%
i meant to send this out so they have
both

03:35:26.309 --> 03:35:26.319 align:start position:0%
both
 
03:35:31.050 --> 03:35:31.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:31.060 --> 03:35:36.389 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:35:36.389 --> 03:35:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:38.870 --> 03:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
so so mr ripple while we're waiting for
 
03:35:40.309 --> 03:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren
 
03:35:44.950 --> 03:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
i've got a question for you okay
 
03:35:48.389 --> 03:35:48.399 align:start position:0%
okay so this document that um
 
03:35:50.950 --> 03:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
representative erf has created to
 
03:35:53.510 --> 03:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
explain to us what he's done
 
03:35:57.110 --> 03:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
is is really the summary of a tremendous
 
03:35:59.110 --> 03:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
amount of line by line work that he's
 
03:35:59.120 --> 03:36:00.070 align:start position:0%
amount of line by line work that he's
done

03:36:00.070 --> 03:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:36:03.750 --> 03:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
that line by line work that he's done is
 
03:36:06.790 --> 03:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
kind of in a process document
 
03:36:10.309 --> 03:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
it's not a final document to what extent
 
03:36:13.910 --> 03:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
should we use are we obligated or
 
03:36:16.469 --> 03:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
or is it appropriate for us to share
 
03:36:16.479 --> 03:36:17.830 align:start position:0%
or is it appropriate for us to share
publicly

03:36:17.830 --> 03:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
publicly
 
03:36:20.550 --> 03:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
that line by line that we know isn't the
 
03:36:22.950 --> 03:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
final document it's just a way for us to
 
03:36:25.590 --> 03:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
work and communicate
 
03:36:27.830 --> 03:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
if it's a proposal that you and
 
03:36:29.110 --> 03:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative europe are willing to
 
03:36:29.830 --> 03:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
share there's
 
03:36:31.030 --> 03:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's any harm in
 
03:36:34.229 --> 03:36:34.239 align:start position:0%
sharing it i i don't really care to
 
03:36:37.030 --> 03:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
because i know it's going to change so
 
03:36:38.950 --> 03:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
much i don't want to
 
03:36:42.309 --> 03:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
create um anxiety
 
03:36:45.110 --> 03:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
over what's just an internal temporary
 
03:36:47.750 --> 03:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
working document
 
03:36:49.750 --> 03:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
so if i don't have to share it i don't
 
03:36:52.710 --> 03:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:54.790 --> 03:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
um i don't think you have to share it i
 
03:36:54.800 --> 03:36:55.830 align:start position:0%
um i don't think you have to share it i
mean

03:36:55.830 --> 03:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
mean
 
03:36:58.070 --> 03:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
to some extent it's it's you know it's
 
03:36:59.510 --> 03:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
been emailed out to the division as a
 
03:36:59.520 --> 03:37:00.830 align:start position:0%
been emailed out to the division as a
whole

03:37:00.830 --> 03:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
whole
 
03:37:03.590 --> 03:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
so it's up to individual members to
 
03:37:05.030 --> 03:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
decide what they want to do with that
 
03:37:05.040 --> 03:37:05.349 align:start position:0%
decide what they want to do with that
but

03:37:05.349 --> 03:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:37:09.269 --> 03:37:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:11.510 --> 03:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
i don't would need to add to the website
 
03:37:13.590 --> 03:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
just because it's been
 
03:37:16.150 --> 03:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
well i need to think about that all
 
03:37:17.670 --> 03:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
right please think about that
 
03:37:20.950 --> 03:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
and miss rounds you did you get a copy
 
03:37:22.870 --> 03:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
because we wanted to make sure we copied
 
03:37:24.790 --> 03:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
you on the line by line so just so you
 
03:37:25.990 --> 03:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
know what we're doing
 
03:37:29.269 --> 03:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
i did not i'm sorry cameron i did not
 
03:37:29.990 --> 03:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
realize that but
 
03:37:31.590 --> 03:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
i would love to give her one so that she
 
03:37:33.830 --> 03:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
could tell me where everywhere i went
 
03:37:33.840 --> 03:37:34.150 align:start position:0%
could tell me where everywhere i went
wrong

03:37:34.150 --> 03:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
03:37:37.190 --> 03:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sure there are many places so
 
03:37:40.710 --> 03:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
we are we are now back and uh
 
03:37:43.670 --> 03:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
why don't you why don't you go ahead and
 
03:37:43.680 --> 03:37:43.990 align:start position:0%
why don't you why don't you go ahead and
tell

03:37:43.990 --> 03:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
tell
 
03:37:47.670 --> 03:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
us what's being shared here okay
 
03:37:51.670 --> 03:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
so the chairman and i were trying to
 
03:37:54.309 --> 03:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
come up with a place to start to go
 
03:37:56.389 --> 03:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
forward in this process
 
03:37:58.550 --> 03:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
and uh we kind of divided things
 
03:38:00.870 --> 03:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
globally at the start
 
03:38:03.830 --> 03:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
i was looking at the numbers and uh the
 
03:38:05.510 --> 03:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
channel was looking at the staffing
 
03:38:09.110 --> 03:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to start with with my piece
 
03:38:12.469 --> 03:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
and the idea was to
 
03:38:14.229 --> 03:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
start with the fact that we all have to
 
03:38:17.190 --> 03:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
work with the ways and means
 
03:38:19.590 --> 03:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
revenue numbers and those are the we
 
03:38:21.670 --> 03:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
have to respect that process
 
03:38:26.389 --> 03:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
that kind of begins um at that point
 
03:38:28.469 --> 03:38:28.479 align:start position:0%
and we also needed a place a good solid
 
03:38:28.479 --> 03:38:29.670 align:start position:0%
and we also needed a place a good solid
foundation

03:38:29.670 --> 03:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
foundation
 
03:38:33.349 --> 03:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
to build from and it seemed like the
 
03:38:35.429 --> 03:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
obvious choice there was to start
 
03:38:39.830 --> 03:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
with our current uh f fy 21
 
03:38:43.910 --> 03:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
budget and use the adjusted authorized
 
03:38:47.030 --> 03:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
numbers since that's that
 
03:38:49.030 --> 03:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
seems to completely capture as kevin
 
03:38:50.469 --> 03:38:50.479 align:start position:0%
pointed out to me
 
03:38:54.229 --> 03:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
not just what was in hb 3 last current
 
03:38:54.239 --> 03:38:55.510 align:start position:0%
not just what was in hb 3 last current
biennium

03:38:55.510 --> 03:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
03:38:59.750 --> 03:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
but also what was in hb what was an hb4
 
03:39:01.590 --> 03:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
so the second to the left column i kind
 
03:39:02.950 --> 03:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
of i don't know what that color is
 
03:39:04.630 --> 03:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
whatever that color is it says current
 
03:39:06.950 --> 03:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
biennium baseline at the top
 
03:39:10.469 --> 03:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
that is those numbers represent the
 
03:39:14.070 --> 03:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
fy 21 adjusted authorized
 
03:39:17.030 --> 03:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
values for both federal funds and
 
03:39:18.550 --> 03:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
03:39:23.030 --> 03:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
so that's the foundation that
 
03:39:26.389 --> 03:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to build on so then
 
03:39:29.670 --> 03:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
looking towards the top of the middle
 
03:39:32.469 --> 03:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
part of the document there where we're
 
03:39:32.479 --> 03:39:33.670 align:start position:0%
part of the document there where we're
starting

03:39:33.670 --> 03:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
starting
 
03:39:35.429 --> 03:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
in some ways you could say from the
 
03:39:37.750 --> 03:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
governor's proposed budget
 
03:39:40.870 --> 03:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
so his uh numbers
 
03:39:44.309 --> 03:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
are up there as well and of course as
 
03:39:45.110 --> 03:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
we're all aware
 
03:39:48.469 --> 03:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
he started with higher
 
03:39:51.030 --> 03:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates so we need to
 
03:39:51.040 --> 03:39:52.229 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates so we need to
basically

03:39:52.229 --> 03:39:52.239 align:start position:0%
basically
 
03:39:54.870 --> 03:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
be coming in below that with the ways
 
03:39:55.830 --> 03:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
and means number
 
03:39:57.830 --> 03:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
but rather than kind of building down to
 
03:39:59.990 --> 03:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
it we thought it'd be better to try to
 
03:40:00.000 --> 03:40:00.710 align:start position:0%
it we thought it'd be better to try to
build

03:40:00.710 --> 03:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
build
 
03:40:04.950 --> 03:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
up to it so starting with
 
03:40:08.870 --> 03:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
the fy21 adjusted authorized
 
03:40:11.910 --> 03:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
budget in conjunction with
 
03:40:15.750 --> 03:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget i work to develop
 
03:40:18.950 --> 03:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
what i'm calling a zero base uh
 
03:40:20.790 --> 03:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
starting point and sharon go ahead i
 
03:40:22.870 --> 03:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
just feel free to interrupt me
 
03:40:24.309 --> 03:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
you're doing great all right all right
 
03:40:25.910 --> 03:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
she's a hand up trying to figure out
 
03:40:26.710 --> 03:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
when to
 
03:40:28.710 --> 03:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
have representative nordgren interrupt
 
03:40:30.070 --> 03:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
you yeah i know have us
 
03:40:33.670 --> 03:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
start right in thank you um i think
 
03:40:36.309 --> 03:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh chair weiler was going to have a
 
03:40:36.319 --> 03:40:37.510 align:start position:0%
uh chair weiler was going to have a
discussion

03:40:37.510 --> 03:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
03:40:41.030 --> 03:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
with uh nur major in ways and means
 
03:40:43.030 --> 03:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
and i know there's been some discussion
 
03:40:45.910 --> 03:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
with them revising are we looking at
 
03:40:47.510 --> 03:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
their revenue numbers i was just
 
03:40:47.520 --> 03:40:48.389 align:start position:0%
their revenue numbers i was just
wondering

03:40:48.389 --> 03:40:48.399 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
03:40:50.950 --> 03:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
as a basis for our conversation if
 
03:40:52.710 --> 03:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
that's happened
 
03:40:55.830 --> 03:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:58.870 --> 03:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
so so go ahead representative
 
03:41:00.389 --> 03:41:00.399 align:start position:0%
at this point he hasn't given me
 
03:41:02.229 --> 03:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
anything but we're going to meet we're
 
03:41:04.150 --> 03:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
going to meet and that's all i have so
 
03:41:05.269 --> 03:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
far so
 
03:41:08.070 --> 03:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
nothing concrete that i can go go from
 
03:41:08.080 --> 03:41:09.750 align:start position:0%
nothing concrete that i can go go from
thanks

03:41:09.750 --> 03:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
03:41:12.710 --> 03:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
so so however in response to represent
 
03:41:12.720 --> 03:41:13.429 align:start position:0%
so so however in response to represent
morgan's

03:41:13.429 --> 03:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
morgan's
 
03:41:16.070 --> 03:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
point it works actually quite well with
 
03:41:17.349 --> 03:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
the process
 
03:41:19.910 --> 03:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
i'm describing since what we're hoping
 
03:41:21.830 --> 03:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
to do is to build upwards
 
03:41:25.030 --> 03:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
from a base and we can keep building
 
03:41:28.469 --> 03:41:28.479 align:start position:0%
um upwards as opposed to
 
03:41:30.710 --> 03:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
working down and back up and then
 
03:41:32.070 --> 03:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
working around like that so i i think
 
03:41:33.990 --> 03:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
you'll see that this fits with the model
 
03:41:34.000 --> 03:41:34.389 align:start position:0%
you'll see that this fits with the model
of

03:41:34.389 --> 03:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:41:37.110 --> 03:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
if the ways it means revenue numbers
 
03:41:38.469 --> 03:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
either go up or down
 
03:41:40.630 --> 03:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh we'll be in a we'll be able to work
 
03:41:42.389 --> 03:41:42.399 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:41:46.309 --> 03:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
so so the process i went through
 
03:41:49.670 --> 03:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
was to take these two budgets the or not
 
03:41:49.680 --> 03:41:50.870 align:start position:0%
was to take these two budgets the or not
budgets

03:41:50.870 --> 03:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
03:41:53.110 --> 03:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
the fy 21 adjusted authorized which i'll
 
03:41:54.550 --> 03:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
stop i'll start referring to just as
 
03:41:56.910 --> 03:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
fy21 but that's what i mean when i say
 
03:41:56.920 --> 03:41:58.950 align:start position:0%
fy21 but that's what i mean when i say
fy21

03:41:58.950 --> 03:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
fy21
 
03:42:03.349 --> 03:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
combine that base with the governor's
 
03:42:05.510 --> 03:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
budget which i was viewing as the
 
03:42:07.110 --> 03:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that we all received in
 
03:42:09.189 --> 03:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
addition to the monster
 
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh pdf book that showed his budget as
 
03:42:12.239 --> 03:42:13.269 align:start position:0%
uh pdf book that showed his budget as
well

03:42:13.269 --> 03:42:13.279 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:42:15.030 --> 03:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
and i just did a really simple and it
 
03:42:16.950 --> 03:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
was just a numbers game i wasn't
 
03:42:18.389 --> 03:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
i wasn't playing anything with what was
 
03:42:20.070 --> 03:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
going on um
 
03:42:21.189 --> 03:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
i was just looking at the look at the
 
03:42:23.750 --> 03:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
numbers between those two budgets
 
03:42:26.070 --> 03:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
and when things were kind of like we did
 
03:42:27.670 --> 03:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
this morning when we were talking about
 
03:42:28.550 --> 03:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
03:42:31.990 --> 03:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
quite a bit if a department had only
 
03:42:33.030 --> 03:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
03:42:34.229 --> 03:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
i just took those over from the
 
03:42:36.950 --> 03:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
governor's budget figuring that
 
03:42:39.189 --> 03:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
they probably were the most current and
 
03:42:41.590 --> 03:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
and and karen had
 
03:42:45.189 --> 03:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
they all worked basically for the the uh
 
03:42:46.870 --> 03:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
the budget going forward and worked in
 
03:42:48.070 --> 03:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
light of any changes that might have
 
03:42:49.510 --> 03:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
taken place in federal funds
 
03:42:52.870 --> 03:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
requirements and that sort of thing
 
03:42:56.469 --> 03:42:56.479 align:start position:0%
then i looked at comparisons so if that
 
03:42:57.750 --> 03:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
if it was more than just
 
03:43:01.030 --> 03:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
general funds i also looked at the
 
03:43:04.870 --> 03:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh general funds and the general funds
 
03:43:06.630 --> 03:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
in one and the governor's budget were
 
03:43:09.349 --> 03:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
lower i would also move
 
03:43:11.830 --> 03:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget over again the
 
03:43:13.750 --> 03:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
thinking was that
 
03:43:15.830 --> 03:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
his budget was more current with the
 
03:43:17.269 --> 03:43:17.279 align:start position:0%
department's thinking
 
03:43:19.910 --> 03:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
so i was biased towards trying to
 
03:43:19.920 --> 03:43:21.349 align:start position:0%
so i was biased towards trying to
support

03:43:21.349 --> 03:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:43:23.590 --> 03:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh that current budget where it made
 
03:43:23.600 --> 03:43:24.870 align:start position:0%
uh that current budget where it made
sense

03:43:24.870 --> 03:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
sense
 
03:43:26.710 --> 03:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
and i also looked at even in cases where
 
03:43:27.910 --> 03:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a big difference
 
03:43:29.269 --> 03:43:29.279 align:start position:0%
so general funds were maybe a couple
 
03:43:31.189 --> 03:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars more in one
 
03:43:31.199 --> 03:43:32.070 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars more in one
case

03:43:32.070 --> 03:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
case
 
03:43:34.469 --> 03:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
uh or another and then i'd bring the
 
03:43:35.830 --> 03:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
same thing i'd bring over
 
03:43:39.429 --> 03:43:39.439 align:start position:0%
um the governor's budget where the
 
03:43:42.950 --> 03:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
current budget the current fy 21
 
03:43:46.229 --> 03:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
um numbers not budget numbers were lower
 
03:43:48.630 --> 03:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
i would bring those
 
03:43:51.670 --> 03:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
over in their place so that's what shows
 
03:43:52.870 --> 03:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
up between the two
 
03:43:56.469 --> 03:43:56.479 align:start position:0%
bluish type boxes for
 
03:43:59.269 --> 03:43:59.279 align:start position:0%
federal and general funds there for the
 
03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
for the first year
 
03:44:02.790 --> 03:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
for the second year i at this point i
 
03:44:04.710 --> 03:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
did not build any increase in it's just
 
03:44:06.950 --> 03:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
a duplicate of the
 
03:44:10.229 --> 03:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
23 year the 22 year excuse me the 23 are
 
03:44:12.389 --> 03:44:12.399 align:start position:0%
just the exact duplicate of the
 
03:44:15.910 --> 03:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
of the 22 year and since we needed to
 
03:44:17.110 --> 03:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
know where we were
 
03:44:19.110 --> 03:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
what we had to how much room we had to
 
03:44:20.550 --> 03:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
build up
 
03:44:22.950 --> 03:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
i was looking everything as a reduction
 
03:44:24.469 --> 03:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
from the governor's
 
03:44:26.790 --> 03:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
budget so that's all the negative
 
03:44:28.950 --> 03:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
numbers that you see on there
 
03:44:31.110 --> 03:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
are the reductions from his budget to
 
03:44:33.189 --> 03:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
which we can from which we can build or
 
03:44:33.910 --> 03:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
build into
 
03:44:36.389 --> 03:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
if you will and you can see the total
 
03:44:38.150 --> 03:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
there is that
 
03:44:41.510 --> 03:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
really wildly bolded bright red
 
03:44:44.710 --> 03:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
number about 160 million dollars
 
03:44:48.389 --> 03:44:48.399 align:start position:0%
well over the amount
 
03:44:51.910 --> 03:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
of the current
 
03:44:53.910 --> 03:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
ways and means numbers requiring us to
 
03:44:55.269 --> 03:44:55.279 align:start position:0%
work towards
 
03:44:58.070 --> 03:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
but again as as i said earlier to the
 
03:45:00.070 --> 03:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
extent that those numbers increase
 
03:45:03.189 --> 03:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
then we can we can move further up
 
03:45:06.710 --> 03:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
the scale um so to speak
 
03:45:09.269 --> 03:45:09.279 align:start position:0%
so let's make sure i haven't missed
 
03:45:18.070 --> 03:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:20.070 --> 03:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i've covered what i want to
 
03:45:21.910 --> 03:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
cover regarding this
 
03:45:23.910 --> 03:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
are there specific questions on anything
 
03:45:25.990 --> 03:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
i've laid out there
 
03:45:27.990 --> 03:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
so i would like an opportunity to
 
03:45:29.349 --> 03:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
restate what i think
 
03:45:32.710 --> 03:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
you just said but sort of say it in
 
03:45:35.750 --> 03:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
in in my way to make sure i'm
 
03:45:35.760 --> 03:45:36.630 align:start position:0%
in in my way to make sure i'm
understanding

03:45:36.630 --> 03:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
03:45:40.790 --> 03:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
what where we're all at that
 
03:45:42.870 --> 03:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
that this document that you've put
 
03:45:42.880 --> 03:45:44.229 align:start position:0%
that this document that you've put
together

03:45:44.229 --> 03:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:45:48.389 --> 03:45:48.399 align:start position:0%
is is not anyone's budget proposal
 
03:45:51.269 --> 03:45:51.279 align:start position:0%
what what this document is is it
 
03:45:51.279 --> 03:45:52.229 align:start position:0%
what what this document is is it
establishes

03:45:52.229 --> 03:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
establishes
 
03:45:55.269 --> 03:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
a baseline for the division three folks
 
03:45:56.950 --> 03:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
to work together
 
03:45:59.670 --> 03:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
to say we can go through the line by
 
03:46:02.389 --> 03:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
line and look at the programs
 
03:46:05.750 --> 03:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
and we have money that we can
 
03:46:09.110 --> 03:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
add back to this baseline
 
03:46:11.429 --> 03:46:11.439 align:start position:0%
and and and the reason we went with this
 
03:46:12.229 --> 03:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
approach is
 
03:46:15.429 --> 03:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
is because early on we took a look at
 
03:46:17.110 --> 03:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
the simple fact that
 
03:46:19.590 --> 03:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
the the governor's budget was based on a
 
03:46:20.710 --> 03:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
higher revenue
 
03:46:23.349 --> 03:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
estimate than what ways and means came
 
03:46:24.710 --> 03:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
in with
 
03:46:26.870 --> 03:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
and so we had a meeting with the
 
03:46:28.229 --> 03:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
governor's office and
 
03:46:31.269 --> 03:46:31.279 align:start position:0%
invited them to work with division three
 
03:46:32.309 --> 03:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
to identify
 
03:46:35.030 --> 03:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
places that we may reduce from the
 
03:46:36.389 --> 03:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
03:46:38.229 --> 03:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
so that we could stay within the ways
 
03:46:40.870 --> 03:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
and means estimate
 
03:46:43.349 --> 03:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
and they were very courteous but they
 
03:46:44.389 --> 03:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
basically said
 
03:46:47.750 --> 03:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
we believe our revenue numbers and we've
 
03:46:49.269 --> 03:46:49.279 align:start position:0%
given you our budget
 
03:46:52.790 --> 03:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
and you know the the house is going to
 
03:46:54.630 --> 03:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
have to do what the house is going to do
 
03:46:56.630 --> 03:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
but we're really not going to do
 
03:46:58.710 --> 03:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
anything to help you with that
 
03:47:01.910 --> 03:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
reduction process we may answer
 
03:47:04.229 --> 03:47:04.239 align:start position:0%
questions if you ask a specific question
 
03:47:08.070 --> 03:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
so so at that point it felt to me
 
03:47:09.670 --> 03:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
like we were a little bit on our own and
 
03:47:12.150 --> 03:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
we needed to find a way
 
03:47:15.670 --> 03:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
to have a conversation so we wanted to
 
03:47:19.030 --> 03:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
get down to a base to where
 
03:47:21.670 --> 03:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
from that base we could go program by
 
03:47:23.670 --> 03:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
program line by line
 
03:47:26.790 --> 03:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
and and and potentially add some money
 
03:47:26.800 --> 03:47:27.349 align:start position:0%
and and and potentially add some money
back

03:47:27.349 --> 03:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:47:29.670 --> 03:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
and the question was what's the base and
 
03:47:30.790 --> 03:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
what's the
 
03:47:32.070 --> 03:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
what's the amount that we could
 
03:47:33.990 --> 03:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
potentially add back
 
03:47:35.429 --> 03:47:35.439 align:start position:0%
and that's where keith has been
 
03:47:37.590 --> 03:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
invaluable he went through
 
03:47:39.110 --> 03:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
he looked at the governor's budget
 
03:47:42.150 --> 03:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
compared to the fy 21
 
03:47:45.429 --> 03:47:45.439 align:start position:0%
whichever number was was was lower he
 
03:47:45.439 --> 03:47:46.309 align:start position:0%
whichever number was was was lower he
took

03:47:46.309 --> 03:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
took
 
03:47:50.229 --> 03:47:50.239 align:start position:0%
if the governor's budget was was uh
 
03:47:53.510 --> 03:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
within 200 000 of an increase he he
 
03:47:55.429 --> 03:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
he took the governor's budget increase
 
03:47:57.429 --> 03:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
of about 200 000.
 
03:47:59.990 --> 03:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
so he took all of that and all of the
 
03:48:01.590 --> 03:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
all of that math
 
03:48:03.910 --> 03:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
and that's where you get to the 7.7
 
03:48:05.269 --> 03:48:05.279 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
03:48:08.710 --> 03:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
that if you take keith's
 
03:48:12.469 --> 03:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
view of a baseline the first year
 
03:48:15.670 --> 03:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
generates about 7.7 million for us to
 
03:48:18.950 --> 03:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
be able to potentially add back
 
03:48:21.429 --> 03:48:21.439 align:start position:0%
now keith this is where i'm i'm getting
 
03:48:24.790 --> 03:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
myself confused between the 7.7
 
03:48:27.670 --> 03:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
and the 54.2 okay do you want me to pick
 
03:48:28.630 --> 03:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
it up
 
03:48:32.950 --> 03:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
yes okay so the first thing i did
 
03:48:34.950 --> 03:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
which is what the champions of furniture
 
03:48:37.349 --> 03:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
are the top two lines there
 
03:48:40.870 --> 03:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
that is simply comparing the fy 21
 
03:48:40.880 --> 03:48:41.990 align:start position:0%
that is simply comparing the fy 21
budget

03:48:41.990 --> 03:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:48:45.030 --> 03:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
as it is as it stands to the governor's
 
03:48:45.040 --> 03:48:46.790 align:start position:0%
as it is as it stands to the governor's
budget

03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:48:49.830 --> 03:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
as provided to us and that's where those
 
03:48:53.189 --> 03:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
so just comparing those two numbers
 
03:48:55.830 --> 03:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget is about seven
 
03:48:57.510 --> 03:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
point seven million dollars in the first
 
03:48:57.520 --> 03:48:57.990 align:start position:0%
point seven million dollars in the first
year

03:48:57.990 --> 03:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:49:01.830 --> 03:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
higher than the current
 
03:49:05.189 --> 03:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh fy 21 budget fy29 expenses
 
03:49:07.349 --> 03:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
and in the second year it's about 58
 
03:49:08.469 --> 03:49:08.479 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
03:49:12.229 --> 03:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
higher than the current year's
 
03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
budget right not a word and then i'm
 
03:49:16.550 --> 03:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
sorry go ahead
 
03:49:19.269 --> 03:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
i'm back to understanding where we are
 
03:49:19.279 --> 03:49:19.830 align:start position:0%
i'm back to understanding where we are
so

03:49:19.830 --> 03:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:49:23.189 --> 03:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
so so the total of
 
03:49:26.469 --> 03:49:26.479 align:start position:0%
the baseline that representative earth
 
03:49:27.670 --> 03:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
came up with
 
03:49:31.110 --> 03:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
by following this algorithm
 
03:49:33.269 --> 03:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
which was whichever is lower between
 
03:49:35.990 --> 03:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
fy21 and the governor's budget take
 
03:49:39.750 --> 03:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
the lower number with the exception of
 
03:49:42.950 --> 03:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
if the governor's number is
 
03:49:46.229 --> 03:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
200 000 or less of an increase go ahead
 
03:49:47.750 --> 03:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
and take it
 
03:49:51.750 --> 03:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
so so that algorithm led him to
 
03:49:55.590 --> 03:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
an 835 million 568
 
03:49:58.790 --> 03:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar baseline
 
03:50:01.510 --> 03:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
that is not our budget proposal by
 
03:50:02.469 --> 03:50:02.479 align:start position:0%
taking a look
 
03:50:06.870 --> 03:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
at that 835
 
03:50:11.030 --> 03:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
it looks that we have about 54.2 million
 
03:50:13.189 --> 03:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
that could be potentially added back
 
03:50:17.750 --> 03:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
now that 54.2 million in year one
 
03:50:19.830 --> 03:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
pardon me in year one that's just in
 
03:50:20.870 --> 03:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
year one
 
03:50:24.550 --> 03:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
year one still has to pay back
 
03:50:28.469 --> 03:50:28.479 align:start position:0%
the the fact that the ways and means
 
03:50:31.510 --> 03:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
budget or estimate is less than
 
03:50:34.870 --> 03:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
um the governor's so
 
03:50:38.229 --> 03:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
so we don't get all 54 million to to add
 
03:50:38.239 --> 03:50:38.630 align:start position:0%
so we don't get all 54 million to to add
back

03:50:38.630 --> 03:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:50:40.309 --> 03:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's going to be some number
 
03:50:42.389 --> 03:50:42.399 align:start position:0%
that we work out with mr cain and the
 
03:50:42.399 --> 03:50:42.950 align:start position:0%
that we work out with mr cain and the
chairman

03:50:42.950 --> 03:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:50:45.349 --> 03:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
and but you know let's say it's half of
 
03:50:47.349 --> 03:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
that so we have about
 
03:50:50.389 --> 03:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
25 million of that 54 that we could add
 
03:50:51.910 --> 03:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
back in year one
 
03:50:56.670 --> 03:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
and in year two it's it year two is
 
03:50:58.950 --> 03:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
105.12 million
 
03:51:00.950 --> 03:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
of which again about half of that we can
 
03:51:04.309 --> 03:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
probably add back to that
 
03:51:08.870 --> 03:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
fy 23 number so it's the add backs
 
03:51:12.229 --> 03:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
that i i i'm hoping that we have
 
03:51:15.670 --> 03:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
some common ground on representative
 
03:51:15.680 --> 03:51:18.309 align:start position:0%
some common ground on representative
walner

03:51:18.309 --> 03:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:21.670 --> 03:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
this is more for a question for um
 
03:51:25.510 --> 03:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
chairman weiler i think so i was never
 
03:51:25.520 --> 03:51:26.389 align:start position:0%
chairman weiler i think so i was never
really

03:51:26.389 --> 03:51:26.399 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:51:30.389 --> 03:51:30.399 align:start position:0%
clear exactly
 
03:51:33.750 --> 03:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
how much below the governor's
 
03:51:36.950 --> 03:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
estimates the house estimates were
 
03:51:40.870 --> 03:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
and how you had a a portion nap
 
03:51:44.550 --> 03:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
per each division so
 
03:51:46.710 --> 03:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
i wondered if you could explain to us
 
03:51:48.469 --> 03:51:48.479 align:start position:0%
how much each division
 
03:51:50.950 --> 03:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
or maybe you didn't assign each division
 
03:51:50.960 --> 03:51:53.110 align:start position:0%
or maybe you didn't assign each division
maybe

03:51:53.110 --> 03:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
03:51:55.269 --> 03:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
maybe it was some other formula or
 
03:51:57.670 --> 03:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
something so i just wondered how much
 
03:52:01.110 --> 03:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
how much were we how much was division
 
03:52:04.550 --> 03:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
three supposed to be reducing
 
03:52:10.830 --> 03:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:10.840 --> 03:52:13.510 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:52:13.510 --> 03:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:52:16.710 --> 03:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you so the initial
 
03:52:19.269 --> 03:52:19.279 align:start position:0%
thought was it's like 70 million
 
03:52:20.710 --> 03:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
03:52:22.790 --> 03:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
what they delivered to us from ways and
 
03:52:24.790 --> 03:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
means and what the governor's budget
 
03:52:25.990 --> 03:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
looked like
 
03:52:28.870 --> 03:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
and we had a discussion about that and
 
03:52:29.750 --> 03:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
we looked at
 
03:52:32.870 --> 03:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
how much the increases had been year
 
03:52:34.070 --> 03:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
over year
 
03:52:37.670 --> 03:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
and the biggest increase was in hhs
 
03:52:41.269 --> 03:52:41.279 align:start position:0%
not so much in the other divisions
 
03:52:43.269 --> 03:52:43.279 align:start position:0%
education had actually come down quite a
 
03:52:45.750 --> 03:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
bit and
 
03:52:47.910 --> 03:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
the departments that were in division
 
03:52:47.920 --> 03:52:48.950 align:start position:0%
the departments that were in division
one

03:52:48.950 --> 03:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:52:52.870 --> 03:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
um not not a big change there
 
03:52:56.790 --> 03:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
but the biggest change overall was hhs
 
03:52:59.030 --> 03:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
so it occurred that that was where there
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
was the most room
 
03:53:03.349 --> 03:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
especially from our discussions they had
 
03:53:05.110 --> 03:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
this huge increase from
 
03:53:07.750 --> 03:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
from 21 which they still hadn't been
 
03:53:09.189 --> 03:53:09.199 align:start position:0%
able to fill the jobs
 
03:53:12.229 --> 03:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
they had the money on the books but
 
03:53:15.110 --> 03:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
hadn't been dedicated to employees or
 
03:53:16.550 --> 03:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
anything at this point
 
03:53:19.189 --> 03:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
so there seemed to be more room in
 
03:53:20.550 --> 03:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
division three
 
03:53:22.870 --> 03:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
to take the largest part of the
 
03:53:22.880 --> 03:53:24.150 align:start position:0%
to take the largest part of the
reductions

03:53:24.150 --> 03:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
03:53:27.750 --> 03:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
and so i did get i think about a 17 or
 
03:53:29.670 --> 03:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
18 000 out of
 
03:53:31.670 --> 03:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
division one and maybe only a couple of
 
03:53:34.070 --> 03:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
thousand on a division
 
03:53:37.189 --> 03:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
about 18 million out of uh division
 
03:53:38.790 --> 03:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
one and maybe a couple million out of
 
03:53:41.510 --> 03:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
division two and she said that's all she
 
03:53:42.710 --> 03:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
could do
 
03:53:46.150 --> 03:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
so keith took on this project
 
03:53:48.469 --> 03:53:48.479 align:start position:0%
and said well you know this was this
 
03:53:49.349 --> 03:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
huge increase
 
03:53:52.309 --> 03:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
24 from one year to the next from 20 to
 
03:53:52.319 --> 03:53:53.590 align:start position:0%
24 from one year to the next from 20 to
21

03:53:53.590 --> 03:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
21
 
03:53:55.269 --> 03:53:55.279 align:start position:0%
and they really still haven't caught up
 
03:53:56.630 --> 03:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
with it so
 
03:53:59.429 --> 03:53:59.439 align:start position:0%
there's capacity there that we're not
 
03:54:01.189 --> 03:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
hurting anybody or any program
 
03:54:03.910 --> 03:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
if we if we take a cut of where the
 
03:54:06.550 --> 03:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
money hasn't already been
 
03:54:09.590 --> 03:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
promised anything so that's the way we
 
03:54:09.600 --> 03:54:12.070 align:start position:0%
promised anything so that's the way we
proceeded

03:54:12.070 --> 03:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
proceeded
 
03:54:14.870 --> 03:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up representative just
 
03:54:16.150 --> 03:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
let me see if i follow
 
03:54:19.269 --> 03:54:19.279 align:start position:0%
so um division one had
 
03:54:21.910 --> 03:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
an assignment of about 18 million
 
03:54:21.920 --> 03:54:22.550 align:start position:0%
an assignment of about 18 million
division

03:54:22.550 --> 03:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
division
 
03:54:24.950 --> 03:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
two it sounds like was only a couple of
 
03:54:24.960 --> 03:54:26.070 align:start position:0%
two it sounds like was only a couple of
million

03:54:26.070 --> 03:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:54:28.229 --> 03:54:28.239 align:start position:0%
and division three must have been 50
 
03:54:28.239 --> 03:54:29.910 align:start position:0%
and division three must have been 50
million

03:54:29.910 --> 03:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:54:31.830 --> 03:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
i never really assigned it i just asked
 
03:54:33.429 --> 03:54:33.439 align:start position:0%
them to take a look and see how much
 
03:54:34.870 --> 03:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
they could cut
 
03:54:37.189 --> 03:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
and come back to me and see what you
 
03:54:38.309 --> 03:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
could do
 
03:54:41.030 --> 03:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
and division two said this is going to
 
03:54:42.790 --> 03:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
be tough i don't think i can take away
 
03:54:45.030 --> 03:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
much of it division one said you know a
 
03:54:46.070 --> 03:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
lot of mine is the
 
03:54:48.150 --> 03:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
interest on the treasurer's office this
 
03:54:49.189 --> 03:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
03:54:51.269 --> 03:54:51.279 align:start position:0%
and you know you can't reduce that so
 
03:54:52.309 --> 03:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
once we started
 
03:54:54.309 --> 03:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
looking at details of where the money
 
03:54:55.750 --> 03:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
could come from
 
03:54:59.030 --> 03:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
there weren't many places that
 
03:55:01.189 --> 03:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
you know that had gone up with the same
 
03:55:02.229 --> 03:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
increase that was
 
03:55:05.750 --> 03:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
from uh 20 to 21
 
03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
in uh in hhs so as i said that's why
 
03:55:11.990 --> 03:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
it looked like there was room there to
 
03:55:13.189 --> 03:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
say okay you were given
 
03:55:15.510 --> 03:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
all these programs but you haven't done
 
03:55:16.790 --> 03:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
anything about them yet or you haven't
 
03:55:17.990 --> 03:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
found the people yet
 
03:55:20.309 --> 03:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
with hiring freeze or whatever else on
 
03:55:22.070 --> 03:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
available people so that
 
03:55:24.950 --> 03:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
we were hurting them the least by making
 
03:55:25.750 --> 03:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
the cuts
 
03:55:27.349 --> 03:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
because it was cuts to program that
 
03:55:31.670 --> 03:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:35.590 --> 03:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative nordgren
 
03:55:38.630 --> 03:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr thank you mr
 
03:55:38.640 --> 03:55:39.269 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr thank you mr
chair

03:55:39.269 --> 03:55:39.279 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:55:42.710 --> 03:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
so i guess the lurking question
 
03:55:45.590 --> 03:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
for me is whatever happened to all the
 
03:55:46.790 --> 03:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
money that
 
03:55:50.950 --> 03:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
the department lapsed we know they
 
03:55:54.070 --> 03:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
lapsed millions and i'm just wondering
 
03:55:54.080 --> 03:55:54.469 align:start position:0%
lapsed millions and i'm just wondering
how

03:55:54.469 --> 03:55:54.479 align:start position:0%
how
 
03:55:57.910 --> 03:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
this fits into ken's equation
 
03:56:02.229 --> 03:56:02.239 align:start position:0%
thank you so so because i i'm i'm less
 
03:56:04.710 --> 03:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
familiar with the history and the jargon
 
03:56:06.550 --> 03:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
let me ask for clarification when you
 
03:56:10.670 --> 03:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
talk about lapsing are you referring to
 
03:56:13.510 --> 03:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
fy20 fy21
 
03:56:17.750 --> 03:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
or a combination a combination
 
03:56:20.550 --> 03:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
we know that we budgeted money they
 
03:56:22.070 --> 03:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
didn't spend
 
03:56:24.229 --> 03:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
and it was millions of dollars i was
 
03:56:27.269 --> 03:56:27.279 align:start position:0%
just wondering how that figures into
 
03:56:30.070 --> 03:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
to what we're supposed to be cutting out
 
03:56:30.080 --> 03:56:30.710 align:start position:0%
to what we're supposed to be cutting out
of

03:56:30.710 --> 03:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:56:33.030 --> 03:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
the budget proposal in front of us
 
03:56:33.040 --> 03:56:34.229 align:start position:0%
the budget proposal in front of us
thanks

03:56:34.229 --> 03:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
03:56:37.429 --> 03:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
sharon uh rebellion organ um i actually
 
03:56:37.990 --> 03:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
think i can
 
03:56:41.189 --> 03:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
handle that okay okay uh
 
03:56:45.830 --> 03:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:48.950 --> 03:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh the fy 19
 
03:56:52.070 --> 03:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
we don't see fy20 on this sheet but the
 
03:56:53.189 --> 03:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
fy 20
 
03:56:57.110 --> 03:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
number was was pretty solid because the
 
03:56:57.750 --> 03:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
books got
 
03:57:00.710 --> 03:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
closed on fy 20. the books were also
 
03:57:03.030 --> 03:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
closed on fy 19.
 
03:57:06.150 --> 03:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
but to get to the fy 21 number we went
 
03:57:09.990 --> 03:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
from 750 million to 882
 
03:57:12.550 --> 03:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
because as you've as we've been
 
03:57:12.560 --> 03:57:13.590 align:start position:0%
because as you've as we've been
listening

03:57:13.590 --> 03:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
listening
 
03:57:15.910 --> 03:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
they have these fairly significant
 
03:57:18.150 --> 03:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates
 
03:57:21.269 --> 03:57:21.279 align:start position:0%
you can and and given how much money is
 
03:57:23.189 --> 03:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
goes into the personnel line and the
 
03:57:24.950 --> 03:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
benefits line
 
03:57:28.870 --> 03:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
there's probably a really hefty lapse
 
03:57:32.229 --> 03:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
getting teed up for fy21
 
03:57:34.389 --> 03:57:34.399 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if the department has
 
03:57:35.750 --> 03:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
an estimate
 
03:57:37.830 --> 03:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
of how much they're going to lapse in fy
 
03:57:37.840 --> 03:57:39.189 align:start position:0%
of how much they're going to lapse in fy
21

03:57:39.189 --> 03:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
21
 
03:57:42.950 --> 03:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
or a historical number for fy 20.
 
03:57:46.550 --> 03:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
and and so uh ms rounds if you
 
03:57:48.870 --> 03:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
if you have answers to those uh that
 
03:57:50.710 --> 03:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
would be responsive to represent
 
03:57:53.990 --> 03:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
norgrin's number or question sure yes so
 
03:57:55.990 --> 03:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
i provided the lapse information for
 
03:57:57.510 --> 03:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20
 
03:58:00.469 --> 03:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
and our estimate for fiscal year 22 um
 
03:58:01.590 --> 03:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
on saturday
 
03:58:03.349 --> 03:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure if kevin's had a chance
 
03:58:05.030 --> 03:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
to get all that information out to you
 
03:58:05.040 --> 03:58:05.750 align:start position:0%
to get all that information out to you
yet

03:58:05.750 --> 03:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
yet
 
03:58:09.269 --> 03:58:09.279 align:start position:0%
um our labs um
 
03:58:12.550 --> 03:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 21 there was a further
 
03:58:14.630 --> 03:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
so fiscal year 20 i provided it by
 
03:58:14.640 --> 03:58:15.990 align:start position:0%
so fiscal year 20 i provided it by
division

03:58:15.990 --> 03:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
division
 
03:58:19.189 --> 03:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
and class line for fiscal year
 
03:58:22.389 --> 03:58:22.399 align:start position:0%
22 i provided a higher level estimate
 
03:58:24.070 --> 03:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
because of course right now it's based
 
03:58:24.080 --> 03:58:24.630 align:start position:0%
because of course right now it's based
on

03:58:24.630 --> 03:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:58:28.229 --> 03:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
um on estimates on projections
 
03:58:31.670 --> 03:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
that are still um in flux
 
03:58:34.870 --> 03:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh but our laps will be at least 75
 
03:58:36.710 --> 03:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars and i was estimating
 
03:58:38.150 --> 03:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
that about 25
 
03:58:40.630 --> 03:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
of that was uh potentially from
 
03:58:42.229 --> 03:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
personnel which is about
 
03:58:46.309 --> 03:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh 18 million twice you said fy
 
03:58:50.309 --> 03:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
22 estimated i'm sorry 21. i'm sorry
 
03:58:52.950 --> 03:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
i'm jumping out of here in my brain yeah
 
03:58:52.960 --> 03:58:53.349 align:start position:0%
i'm jumping out of here in my brain yeah
so

03:58:53.349 --> 03:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:58:56.070 --> 03:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
so you gave us an actual for fy20 and
 
03:58:56.080 --> 03:58:56.550 align:start position:0%
so you gave us an actual for fy20 and
you're

03:58:56.550 --> 03:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
you're
 
03:59:00.710 --> 03:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
estimating for fy21 about a 75 million
 
03:59:04.389 --> 03:59:04.399 align:start position:0%
laps correct all right at least just
 
03:59:06.389 --> 03:59:06.399 align:start position:0%
i would say at least a 75 million dollar
 
03:59:06.399 --> 03:59:07.910 align:start position:0%
i would say at least a 75 million dollar
lapse

03:59:07.910 --> 03:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
lapse
 
03:59:10.150 --> 03:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
representative while your hand was up is
 
03:59:13.030 --> 03:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
that from the last one
 
03:59:16.950 --> 03:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
oh i had a question for his rounds
 
03:59:20.389 --> 03:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
all right but in this
 
03:59:22.469 --> 03:59:22.479 align:start position:0%
in this last budget some years we have
 
03:59:24.150 --> 03:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
given you an assigned
 
03:59:28.229 --> 03:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
lapse percentage of your budget
 
03:59:31.110 --> 03:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
in this last budget you did um i'm i'm
 
03:59:32.309 --> 03:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
gonna look up because
 
03:59:35.510 --> 03:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh it it's so important to what mary and
 
03:59:35.520 --> 03:59:35.990 align:start position:0%
uh it it's so important to what mary and
i

03:59:35.990 --> 03:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:59:37.830 --> 03:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh consider when we're managing
 
03:59:39.750 --> 03:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
everything that i actually posted on the
 
03:59:41.750 --> 03:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
board above my monitors
 
03:59:45.030 --> 03:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
so our labs target for fiscal year 21
 
03:59:47.269 --> 03:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
was 33 million dollars
 
03:59:49.590 --> 03:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
so we're going to exceed that uh by at
 
03:59:50.950 --> 03:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
least um
 
03:59:54.389 --> 03:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
40 to 50 million dollars um so
 
03:59:56.870 --> 03:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
if i may do you mind if i just add
 
03:59:57.910 --> 03:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
something to that
 
04:00:00.229 --> 04:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
also a little bit in response to what
 
04:00:01.670 --> 04:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:00:03.510 --> 04:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative norgrum was asking
 
04:00:05.110 --> 04:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
about lapses
 
04:00:07.990 --> 04:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
and i i think maybe part of what she was
 
04:00:09.590 --> 04:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
getting at is what is the
 
04:00:12.950 --> 04:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
lapse target for 2223 um
 
04:00:15.990 --> 04:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
i do know that across the state
 
04:00:17.910 --> 04:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
if i remember the governor's budget
 
04:00:19.910 --> 04:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
correctly it was something like two and
 
04:00:20.550 --> 04:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
a half or
 
04:00:23.830 --> 04:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
three percent um so i do know and this
 
04:00:25.349 --> 04:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
may be what representative weiler was
 
04:00:26.070 --> 04:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
getting at
 
04:00:28.229 --> 04:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
there have been previous budgets where
 
04:00:28.239 --> 04:00:29.750 align:start position:0%
there have been previous budgets where
the

04:00:29.750 --> 04:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:00:32.150 --> 04:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
the appropriations are not reduced
 
04:00:32.160 --> 04:00:33.030 align:start position:0%
the appropriations are not reduced
directly

04:00:33.030 --> 04:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
directly
 
04:00:35.510 --> 04:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
however the lapse target is increased
 
04:00:37.750 --> 04:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
and the department is instructed
 
04:00:40.389 --> 04:00:40.399 align:start position:0%
that their lapse must be at least x
 
04:00:40.399 --> 04:00:41.269 align:start position:0%
that their lapse must be at least x
amount

04:00:41.269 --> 04:00:41.279 align:start position:0%
amount
 
04:00:44.070 --> 04:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
um and then we report on that i'd like
 
04:00:45.830 --> 04:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
to say monthly to fiscal but you all
 
04:00:46.790 --> 04:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
know that i have
 
04:00:48.550 --> 04:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
a terrible track record with monthly
 
04:00:50.469 --> 04:00:50.479 align:start position:0%
it's more like every other month
 
04:00:52.950 --> 04:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
but i do report to fiscal committee on
 
04:00:52.960 --> 04:00:53.910 align:start position:0%
but i do report to fiscal committee on
um

04:00:53.910 --> 04:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:56.229 --> 04:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
on where we are with the labs target so
 
04:00:57.910 --> 04:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
that is something that has also been
 
04:01:00.710 --> 04:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
considered in the past
 
04:01:02.710 --> 04:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
so representative while are you you're
 
04:01:04.710 --> 04:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
short in a follow-up mode if you have
 
04:01:04.720 --> 04:01:07.189 align:start position:0%
short in a follow-up mode if you have
one

04:01:07.189 --> 04:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:08.870 --> 04:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
now i think that was the information
 
04:01:10.630 --> 04:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
that i discussed with you the other day
 
04:01:10.640 --> 04:01:10.950 align:start position:0%
that i discussed with you the other day
about

04:01:10.950 --> 04:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:01:13.990 --> 04:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
lapses and signed lapse rates and uh and
 
04:01:15.030 --> 04:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
so on so i just
 
04:01:16.550 --> 04:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring that all up for anybody
 
04:01:18.150 --> 04:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
that didn't know it before
 
04:01:20.950 --> 04:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
and uh you know it's a typical thing
 
04:01:20.960 --> 04:01:21.510 align:start position:0%
and uh you know it's a typical thing
like

04:01:21.510 --> 04:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:01:23.349 --> 04:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
ms ron said two and a half to three
 
04:01:25.189 --> 04:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
percent everybody's expected to lap
 
04:01:25.199 --> 04:01:26.070 align:start position:0%
percent everybody's expected to lap
something

04:01:26.070 --> 04:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:01:28.229 --> 04:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
and with the events we've had in this
 
04:01:30.150 --> 04:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
previous year and a half
 
04:01:34.630 --> 04:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:36.550 --> 04:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative wallner and
 
04:01:39.670 --> 04:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
then representative norgren
 
04:01:42.870 --> 04:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
so karen um
 
04:01:46.309 --> 04:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
there was a back of the budget reduction
 
04:01:50.309 --> 04:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
in the um bill in um the previous budget
 
04:01:53.910 --> 04:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
of 25 it was 25 million did you
 
04:01:56.469 --> 04:01:56.479 align:start position:0%
were you able to take that off from the
 
04:01:58.309 --> 04:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
first year of the biennium
 
04:02:01.990 --> 04:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
correct so i um the lapse information
 
04:02:03.510 --> 04:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
that i sent over
 
04:02:06.070 --> 04:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
saturday i want to say our expenditure
 
04:02:08.469 --> 04:02:08.479 align:start position:0%
lapse was like
 
04:02:10.790 --> 04:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
30-ish million and then our revenue
 
04:02:11.910 --> 04:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
lapse was another
 
04:02:14.229 --> 04:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
around that amount so our total lapse
 
04:02:16.389 --> 04:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
was about 50 to 60 million
 
04:02:18.469 --> 04:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
so we talked with the department of
 
04:02:19.910 --> 04:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
administrative services and the
 
04:02:21.670 --> 04:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner indicated
 
04:02:24.710 --> 04:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
that um our laps could count towards
 
04:02:26.150 --> 04:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
that back of the budget cuts so we
 
04:02:27.830 --> 04:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
consider that back of the budget cut
 
04:02:31.110 --> 04:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
satisfied in um fiscal year 20 because
 
04:02:35.710 --> 04:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:35.720 --> 04:02:36.950 align:start position:0%
 
26.67

04:02:36.950 --> 04:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
26.67
 
04:02:39.349 --> 04:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
million so we definitely exceeded that
 
04:02:42.710 --> 04:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
by at least 25 million dollars
 
04:02:47.590 --> 04:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:51.189 --> 04:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
you paid 25 million for the back of the
 
04:02:51.199 --> 04:02:52.070 align:start position:0%
you paid 25 million for the back of the
budget

04:02:52.070 --> 04:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:02:55.110 --> 04:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
yes that left you 35
 
04:03:00.070 --> 04:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
right yes and our last target was 26.67
 
04:03:02.309 --> 04:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
okay so you had 35 and then your laps
 
04:03:04.469 --> 04:03:04.479 align:start position:0%
target was 26.
 
04:03:07.110 --> 04:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
so you had about 10 million that you
 
04:03:08.309 --> 04:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
exceeded it
 
04:03:11.269 --> 04:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
correct that right okay yeah thank you
 
04:03:12.550 --> 04:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
04:03:16.309 --> 04:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
you have a follow up no that's what i
 
04:03:18.550 --> 04:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to know okay representative
 
04:03:18.560 --> 04:03:20.070 align:start position:0%
wanted to know okay representative
norgren

04:03:20.070 --> 04:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
norgren
 
04:03:23.269 --> 04:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair so maybe i missed
 
04:03:25.189 --> 04:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
it and miss rounds
 
04:03:27.910 --> 04:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh what was the governor's lapse that
 
04:03:29.349 --> 04:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
was presented
 
04:03:33.189 --> 04:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
for you in in the budget he proposed
 
04:03:36.309 --> 04:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
in for 22-23 yeah
 
04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
oh i i would actually defer to kevin on
 
04:03:40.389 --> 04:03:40.399 align:start position:0%
what the percentage was they didn't
 
04:03:42.309 --> 04:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
split it up between departments
 
04:03:43.910 --> 04:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
yet they usually don't do that until the
 
04:03:45.590 --> 04:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
budget is passed
 
04:03:47.590 --> 04:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
so kevin i don't remember if it's two
 
04:03:49.429 --> 04:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
and a half percent or three percent to
 
04:03:51.269 --> 04:03:51.279 align:start position:0%
total general funds
 
04:03:54.309 --> 04:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
yeah the total statewide lapse uh for
 
04:03:55.910 --> 04:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
all the parts was between two and three
 
04:03:57.349 --> 04:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
percent in the first year and between
 
04:03:58.710 --> 04:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
three and four percent in the second
 
04:03:59.830 --> 04:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
year the the figure
 
04:04:02.870 --> 04:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
67 million statewide and fiscal 22 and
 
04:04:09.269 --> 04:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:13.510 --> 04:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so did you just say 97 million
 
04:04:16.309 --> 04:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
plus 56 million or something like that
 
04:04:16.319 --> 04:04:16.710 align:start position:0%
plus 56 million or something like that
so

04:04:16.710 --> 04:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:04:20.389 --> 04:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
it's a total of like 154 million
 
04:04:24.550 --> 04:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh 67 plus 92 is 159 yeah
 
04:04:27.349 --> 04:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
okay which is kind of coincidentally a
 
04:04:29.030 --> 04:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
number that's on this spreadsheet but
 
04:04:32.309 --> 04:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:37.189 --> 04:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:39.590 --> 04:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
so representative weiler i just i i want
 
04:04:41.189 --> 04:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
to come back around and and
 
04:04:43.349 --> 04:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
just make sure i'm clear on on on
 
04:04:44.309 --> 04:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
something you said
 
04:04:47.429 --> 04:04:47.439 align:start position:0%
it sounded like um you were comfortable
 
04:04:48.630 --> 04:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
with the idea
 
04:04:52.630 --> 04:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
that division three would need to
 
04:04:56.229 --> 04:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
handle 50 million of the difference
 
04:04:57.750 --> 04:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
between ways and means and the
 
04:05:00.710 --> 04:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
governor's revenue estimates
 
04:05:03.750 --> 04:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
and but that 50 million is is between
 
04:05:05.750 --> 04:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
the two years of the biennium
 
04:05:09.349 --> 04:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
it's a total of 50 for the two years
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:15.830 --> 04:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
all right sorry to sorry to ask the
 
04:05:17.590 --> 04:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
basic questions like that i just
 
04:05:21.349 --> 04:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
i just don't want to get off
 
04:05:25.670 --> 04:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
all right so so at this point
 
04:05:29.510 --> 04:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that the committee members
 
04:05:33.750 --> 04:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
understand what uh representative erf's
 
04:05:37.429 --> 04:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
summary sheet means it it means
 
04:05:40.630 --> 04:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
that uh between the two years
 
04:05:43.590 --> 04:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
if if we use his the baseline he came up
 
04:05:43.600 --> 04:05:44.150 align:start position:0%
if if we use his the baseline he came up
with

04:05:44.150 --> 04:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:05:47.110 --> 04:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
we've got the significant amount of
 
04:05:51.830 --> 04:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
money about 150
 
04:05:54.710 --> 04:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
that we million that we can add back on
 
04:05:57.189 --> 04:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
a line by line basis
 
04:06:00.150 --> 04:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh based on our understanding of program
 
04:06:00.160 --> 04:06:02.070 align:start position:0%
uh based on our understanding of program
priorities

04:06:02.070 --> 04:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
04:06:05.269 --> 04:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
and uh representative well
 
04:06:07.030 --> 04:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
let's ask miss rounds first in case
 
04:06:09.110 --> 04:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
you're gonna make us smarter what
 
04:06:10.950 --> 04:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
what your hand is up did you want to say
 
04:06:13.269 --> 04:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
something miss rounds
 
04:06:16.070 --> 04:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
no i forgot to take my hand down sorry
 
04:06:16.080 --> 04:06:17.429 align:start position:0%
no i forgot to take my hand down sorry
representative

04:06:17.429 --> 04:06:17.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:06:17.439 --> 04:06:21.189 align:start position:0%
representative
walner

04:06:21.189 --> 04:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:23.269 --> 04:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
well i guess i guess what i'm wondering
 
04:06:23.279 --> 04:06:24.550 align:start position:0%
well i guess i guess what i'm wondering
is

04:06:24.550 --> 04:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:06:27.590 --> 04:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
i just so i'm now i'm clear about what
 
04:06:27.600 --> 04:06:28.389 align:start position:0%
i just so i'm now i'm clear about what
um

04:06:28.389 --> 04:06:28.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:31.189 --> 04:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
was what um the chairman expected us to
 
04:06:31.199 --> 04:06:32.229 align:start position:0%
was what um the chairman expected us to
do

04:06:32.229 --> 04:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:06:35.990 --> 04:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
was to reduce the uh biennium budget
 
04:06:39.269 --> 04:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
by about 50 million in general funds
 
04:06:41.349 --> 04:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
so now i feel really i'm clear about
 
04:06:42.950 --> 04:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
that because up to this point i didn't
 
04:06:45.990 --> 04:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
know exactly what that target number was
 
04:06:49.830 --> 04:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
um and i guess i don't
 
04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
i guess i don't understand exactly why
 
04:06:53.040 --> 04:06:54.710 align:start position:0%
i guess i don't understand exactly why
we

04:06:54.710 --> 04:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:06:57.830 --> 04:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:01.750 --> 04:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
complicated system here of taking away
 
04:07:03.510 --> 04:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
and then adding back
 
04:07:06.309 --> 04:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
why don't we just look i mean this looks
 
04:07:08.630 --> 04:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
like it would be something like
 
04:07:10.309 --> 04:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it doesn't just break down
 
04:07:12.630 --> 04:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
evenly like 25 million the first year
 
04:07:15.429 --> 04:07:15.439 align:start position:0%
and 25 million the second year but
 
04:07:17.590 --> 04:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
i can't understand why we wouldn't why
 
04:07:19.590 --> 04:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't just
 
04:07:22.550 --> 04:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
work towards where you would look for
 
04:07:22.560 --> 04:07:23.030 align:start position:0%
work towards where you would look for
those

04:07:23.030 --> 04:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:07:26.150 --> 04:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
reductions it seems like it would make
 
04:07:28.389 --> 04:07:28.399 align:start position:0%
it almost
 
04:07:31.670 --> 04:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
easier to understand
 
04:07:34.710 --> 04:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
than taking it all away and then adding
 
04:07:36.870 --> 04:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
it all back
 
04:07:39.590 --> 04:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
seems like a lot of extra steps but
 
04:07:39.600 --> 04:07:40.389 align:start position:0%
seems like a lot of extra steps but
maybe

04:07:40.389 --> 04:07:40.399 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:07:43.110 --> 04:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
representative earth can clear my clear
 
04:07:43.120 --> 04:07:43.670 align:start position:0%
representative earth can clear my clear
my

04:07:43.670 --> 04:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:07:46.630 --> 04:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
thinking up well to be fair to
 
04:07:47.910 --> 04:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative verve
 
04:07:50.950 --> 04:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
this was this was uh uh
 
04:07:54.149 --> 04:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
my my brainchild for the most part
 
04:07:56.550 --> 04:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
and and not his and and he's just been
 
04:07:56.560 --> 04:07:57.429 align:start position:0%
and and not his and and he's just been
doing

04:07:57.429 --> 04:07:57.439 align:start position:0%
doing
 
04:08:00.870 --> 04:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
the the excel sheet um not just the
 
04:08:02.550 --> 04:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
excel sheet but he's put
 
04:08:06.710 --> 04:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of time and thought into it so but
 
04:08:08.950 --> 04:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
but if there's anyone default for this
 
04:08:10.309 --> 04:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
approach it's it's
 
04:08:13.590 --> 04:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
it's me because i wanted to get down to
 
04:08:16.630 --> 04:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
a true base
 
04:08:20.950 --> 04:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
so that as we add back
 
04:08:23.990 --> 04:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
i think the process of adding back
 
04:08:27.349 --> 04:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
is an easier conversation to have
 
04:08:31.189 --> 04:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
than trying to go through looking for
 
04:08:34.550 --> 04:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
cuts because every conversation starts
 
04:08:34.560 --> 04:08:34.950 align:start position:0%
cuts because every conversation starts
with

04:08:34.950 --> 04:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:08:36.950 --> 04:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
i want to cut this i want to cut that i
 
04:08:38.630 --> 04:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
want to reduce that
 
04:08:41.750 --> 04:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
and i in this way we're flipping the
 
04:08:41.760 --> 04:08:43.189 align:start position:0%
and i in this way we're flipping the
conversation

04:08:43.189 --> 04:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
04:08:47.429 --> 04:08:47.439 align:start position:0%
to say okay using this baseline
 
04:08:50.710 --> 04:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
where where do we as a committee see
 
04:08:53.030 --> 04:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
our priorities and they our priorities
 
04:08:53.990 --> 04:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
could be
 
04:08:56.389 --> 04:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
in sync with the governor's priorities
 
04:08:57.590 --> 04:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
it could be in sync with the
 
04:08:59.510 --> 04:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
department's priorities it could be in
 
04:08:59.520 --> 04:09:00.389 align:start position:0%
department's priorities it could be in
sync

04:09:00.389 --> 04:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
sync
 
04:09:02.389 --> 04:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
you know it's really up to the committee
 
04:09:04.469 --> 04:09:04.479 align:start position:0%
i think now that we have a solid
 
04:09:04.479 --> 04:09:05.750 align:start position:0%
i think now that we have a solid
baseline

04:09:05.750 --> 04:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
baseline
 
04:09:09.189 --> 04:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
to to begin to add back and i don't know
 
04:09:11.510 --> 04:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
if that's a satisfactory answer but
 
04:09:13.349 --> 04:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
but that's that was kind of the thought
 
04:09:13.359 --> 04:09:14.630 align:start position:0%
but that's that was kind of the thought
process

04:09:14.630 --> 04:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:09:18.630 --> 04:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
i'll take a crack at it mr chairman
 
04:09:20.710 --> 04:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
kevin could you put up just like the
 
04:09:22.630 --> 04:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
first page of the other document i sent
 
04:09:22.640 --> 04:09:25.189 align:start position:0%
first page of the other document i sent
you

04:09:25.189 --> 04:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:35.189 --> 04:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:38.149 --> 04:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
okay so this is what i also sent to you
 
04:09:39.349 --> 04:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
this morning it's basically just the
 
04:09:40.710 --> 04:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
same spreadsheet
 
04:09:42.790 --> 04:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
that that i've been working with and you
 
04:09:44.070 --> 04:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
all i'm not sure which way you work with
 
04:09:44.630 --> 04:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
things but
 
04:09:47.510 --> 04:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's basically the the raw data um with
 
04:09:49.830 --> 04:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
the addition of the
 
04:09:51.269 --> 04:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
the baseline numbers that we've been
 
04:09:53.349 --> 04:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
talking about and i guess to
 
04:09:55.030 --> 04:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
address your question representative
 
04:09:57.030 --> 04:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
walnut i think it's kind of six to one
 
04:09:58.790 --> 04:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
half a dozen of the other
 
04:10:00.790 --> 04:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
so what what i've done in this very
 
04:10:01.990 --> 04:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
right most column here
 
04:10:04.870 --> 04:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
for the the what you see is cyan if you
 
04:10:06.070 --> 04:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
scroll up a few
 
04:10:09.189 --> 04:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
pages well i'm talking uh kevin
 
04:10:10.389 --> 04:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
eventually come to a different color i
 
04:10:12.389 --> 04:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
think it's like a pink color um so
 
04:10:14.149 --> 04:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
they'll see what i'm talking about
 
04:10:17.189 --> 04:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
so that color distinction distinguishes
 
04:10:17.199 --> 04:10:17.590 align:start position:0%
so that color distinction distinguishes
between

04:10:17.590 --> 04:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:10:20.149 --> 04:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
if this is for every department um
 
04:10:20.870 --> 04:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
04:10:23.830 --> 04:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh a governor's budget which is what the
 
04:10:24.710 --> 04:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
cyan blue rec
 
04:10:29.110 --> 04:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
represents or a fy 21
 
04:10:30.870 --> 04:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
piece which is what the as if you keep
 
04:10:32.389 --> 04:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
scrolling you got to keep scrolling that
 
04:10:33.990 --> 04:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
cyan will change to a different color
 
04:10:35.189 --> 04:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
it's quite a ways down there before you
 
04:10:36.950 --> 04:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
get there you go so go back up a little
 
04:10:38.309 --> 04:10:38.319 align:start position:0%
bit there you'll stop right there
 
04:10:40.269 --> 04:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
so there's an example of what came from
 
04:10:42.950 --> 04:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
fy21 as opposed to from the governor
 
04:10:44.469 --> 04:10:44.479 align:start position:0%
so essentially as we were discussing
 
04:10:46.309 --> 04:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
this morning we were talking about
 
04:10:48.350 --> 04:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
okay which are the easy accounts to
 
04:10:48.360 --> 04:10:49.510 align:start position:0%
okay which are the easy accounts to
[Music]

04:10:49.510 --> 04:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:10:51.269 --> 04:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh just say they're good so that'd be
 
04:10:52.550 --> 04:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
really easy we just then we just check
 
04:10:53.830 --> 04:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
them off on here
 
04:10:56.950 --> 04:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
and we do that with everything which of
 
04:10:58.149 --> 04:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
all the accounts whether no matter where
 
04:11:00.070 --> 04:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
they come from are good or bad
 
04:11:02.309 --> 04:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
so instead of thinking from the point of
 
04:11:03.670 --> 04:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
view of the governor's budget
 
04:11:05.830 --> 04:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
this gives us the opportunity to look at
 
04:11:07.590 --> 04:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
as as the chairman was kind of
 
04:11:09.590 --> 04:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
pointing out there maybe there's areas
 
04:11:11.510 --> 04:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
of his that are not necessarily
 
04:11:14.389 --> 04:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
our priorities and we might want to or
 
04:11:15.670 --> 04:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
even the department's priorities where
 
04:11:16.950 --> 04:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
they've been talking about some things
 
04:11:17.830 --> 04:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
that they
 
04:11:20.070 --> 04:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
may have wanted more so it's not to say
 
04:11:21.750 --> 04:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to assume that the
 
04:11:21.760 --> 04:11:23.349 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to assume that the
governor's

04:11:23.349 --> 04:11:23.359 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
04:11:25.910 --> 04:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
budget was what we wanted absolutely and
 
04:11:27.030 --> 04:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
all we had to do was take a few things
 
04:11:27.990 --> 04:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
away from it
 
04:11:29.429 --> 04:11:29.439 align:start position:0%
i thought it would be better and we i
 
04:11:30.950 --> 04:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
should say we because just i spent a lot
 
04:11:32.550 --> 04:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
of time talking about this
 
04:11:35.269 --> 04:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
we better try to put in build up for in
 
04:11:35.279 --> 04:11:35.590 align:start position:0%
we better try to put in build up for in
on

04:11:35.590 --> 04:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:11:37.349 --> 04:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
with using our priorities so that was
 
04:11:38.870 --> 04:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
sort of the thinking and i didn't think
 
04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
it'd be any harder one way or the other
 
04:11:42.710 --> 04:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
since we have to look at every account
 
04:11:47.189 --> 04:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:50.950 --> 04:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:53.750 --> 04:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
so where representative waller did you
 
04:11:56.070 --> 04:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up or
 
04:12:00.309 --> 04:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
i did so how using this method
 
04:12:02.630 --> 04:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
we've heard from the department about a
 
04:12:04.710 --> 04:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
number of items
 
04:12:07.830 --> 04:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
that they had as
 
04:12:11.830 --> 04:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
priorities but they did not get included
 
04:12:15.030 --> 04:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
in the budget so
 
04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
how would we take those into where
 
04:12:21.830 --> 04:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
where do those show on this kind of a
 
04:12:21.840 --> 04:12:23.590 align:start position:0%
where do those show on this kind of a
document

04:12:23.590 --> 04:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
document
 
04:12:26.389 --> 04:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
they they don't show yet because the
 
04:12:28.469 --> 04:12:28.479 align:start position:0%
whole point of this document is to get
 
04:12:30.309 --> 04:12:30.319 align:start position:0%
us down to a baseline
 
04:12:33.269 --> 04:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
to give us some idea of how much we can
 
04:12:34.630 --> 04:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
add back
 
04:12:36.630 --> 04:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
and then of the amount that we can add
 
04:12:37.910 --> 04:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
back we can
 
04:12:40.550 --> 04:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
we can begin to target it in a way that
 
04:12:46.070 --> 04:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:51.750 --> 04:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:53.990 --> 04:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
some sort of a column or some sort of a
 
04:12:56.389 --> 04:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
way of looking at
 
04:13:02.790 --> 04:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:05.910 --> 04:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
so that we as we're looking at a certain
 
04:13:09.030 --> 04:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
area of this spreadsheet
 
04:13:12.229 --> 04:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
we can also see the priorities that the
 
04:13:12.239 --> 04:13:13.590 align:start position:0%
we can also see the priorities that the
department

04:13:13.590 --> 04:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:13:15.590 --> 04:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
has laid out for us that they had not
 
04:13:20.070 --> 04:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:21.910 --> 04:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
so that's a request that neither
 
04:13:23.269 --> 04:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
representative irf and i
 
04:13:27.189 --> 04:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
have made at this point i have assumed
 
04:13:29.429 --> 04:13:29.439 align:start position:0%
that as we go through these line by
 
04:13:29.439 --> 04:13:30.389 align:start position:0%
that as we go through these line by
lines

04:13:30.389 --> 04:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
lines
 
04:13:33.189 --> 04:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
we'll have our notes with us and and and
 
04:13:33.199 --> 04:13:33.590 align:start position:0%
we'll have our notes with us and and and
and

04:13:33.590 --> 04:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:13:36.309 --> 04:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
and the briefings that they gave us and
 
04:13:36.790 --> 04:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
and we'll
 
04:13:38.469 --> 04:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
and and we'll be able to look at that
 
04:13:40.710 --> 04:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
information but if you would like to
 
04:13:42.790 --> 04:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
make a request to
 
04:13:46.550 --> 04:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
mr ripple and to miss rounds i i'm happy
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
to let you do that and hear what they
 
04:13:49.990 --> 04:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
have to say
 
04:13:52.950 --> 04:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
let me just ask do we we probably do
 
04:13:54.389 --> 04:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
you're going to tell me we have this and
 
04:13:55.189 --> 04:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say
 
04:13:58.870 --> 04:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
where is it um do we have a document
 
04:14:01.349 --> 04:14:01.359 align:start position:0%
from this round that has all of the
 
04:14:04.870 --> 04:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:06.550 --> 04:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
you should have that i believe i sent it
 
04:14:08.070 --> 04:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
out and it's also
 
04:14:09.910 --> 04:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
on our website i don't remember which
 
04:14:11.510 --> 04:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
number it is off the top of my head but
 
04:14:13.429 --> 04:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
yes it is
 
04:14:15.429 --> 04:14:15.439 align:start position:0%
okay so we do have a document that lays
 
04:14:16.950 --> 04:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
them all out okay
 
04:14:19.990 --> 04:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you is that is that document
 
04:14:22.389 --> 04:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
in the same sequence as these line by
 
04:14:23.189 --> 04:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
lines or
 
04:14:25.750 --> 04:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
or in a different sequence to where we
 
04:14:27.510 --> 04:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
still have to do one of these mix and
 
04:14:27.520 --> 04:14:27.910 align:start position:0%
still have to do one of these mix and
match

04:14:27.910 --> 04:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
match
 
04:14:33.110 --> 04:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
things uh that i'm not sure
 
04:14:35.110 --> 04:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
i think they're by agency number i don't
 
04:14:36.469 --> 04:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
know if they're in the same accounting
 
04:14:36.479 --> 04:14:37.429 align:start position:0%
know if they're in the same accounting
unit

04:14:37.429 --> 04:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
unit
 
04:14:40.229 --> 04:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
order the other question i would have
 
04:14:41.910 --> 04:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
represented earth when you did this did
 
04:14:42.870 --> 04:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
you also look
 
04:14:46.550 --> 04:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
at the uh 3000 line spreadsheet that i
 
04:14:46.560 --> 04:14:47.670 align:start position:0%
at the uh 3000 line spreadsheet that i
provided

04:14:47.670 --> 04:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
provided
 
04:14:51.030 --> 04:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
that had actuals for 18 19 and 20
 
04:14:53.110 --> 04:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
and then had explanations for why things
 
04:14:53.120 --> 04:14:54.309 align:start position:0%
and then had explanations for why things
changed

04:14:54.309 --> 04:14:54.319 align:start position:0%
changed
 
04:14:57.429 --> 04:14:57.439 align:start position:0%
for every class line well
 
04:14:58.950 --> 04:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
if you're asking do i have all those
 
04:15:01.189 --> 04:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
numbers answers yes
 
04:15:02.950 --> 04:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
was i focusing on those and putting this
 
04:15:05.030 --> 04:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
together not so much
 
04:15:07.349 --> 04:15:07.359 align:start position:0%
okay i also would want to clarify that
 
04:15:07.359 --> 04:15:08.389 align:start position:0%
okay i also would want to clarify that
there's

04:15:08.389 --> 04:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:15:09.670 --> 04:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
there's the governor's letter that came
 
04:15:12.790 --> 04:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
out recently with the your priority list
 
04:15:13.990 --> 04:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
and then i guess there's your own link
 
04:15:15.910 --> 04:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
party list but one thing we don't have
 
04:15:19.750 --> 04:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
is the whole priority list starting from
 
04:15:21.590 --> 04:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
the beginning because really that's what
 
04:15:23.110 --> 04:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
matters right
 
04:15:25.269 --> 04:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
that's just what kevin's talking about
 
04:15:26.870 --> 04:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
that is what i provided
 
04:15:28.790 --> 04:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
okay i i have not seen that i've only
 
04:15:30.309 --> 04:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
seen the governor's
 
04:15:31.910 --> 04:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
letter that showed another whatever it
 
04:15:33.670 --> 04:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
was dozen or so things you wanted to add
 
04:15:33.680 --> 04:15:34.469 align:start position:0%
was dozen or so things you wanted to add
in

04:15:34.469 --> 04:15:34.479 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:15:36.309 --> 04:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh on top of this so maybe that's in
 
04:15:37.670 --> 04:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
that list i haven't gotten to yet
 
04:15:39.110 --> 04:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
and by the way the lapsing stuff while
 
04:15:40.630 --> 04:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
i'm familiar with it that only came out
 
04:15:41.990 --> 04:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
on saturday just so you understand i
 
04:15:42.550 --> 04:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
really didn't
 
04:15:43.990 --> 04:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
i've been working this for several weeks
 
04:15:45.269 --> 04:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
i didn't have a chance to incorporate
 
04:15:46.070 --> 04:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
the lab stuff
 
04:15:47.990 --> 04:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
i apologize for that but i'm glad to try
 
04:15:49.910 --> 04:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
to add another column in
 
04:15:51.990 --> 04:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh for the priority stuff if if that's
 
04:15:52.000 --> 04:15:58.630 align:start position:0%
uh for the priority stuff if if that's
available

04:15:58.630 --> 04:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:01.030 --> 04:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
okay so we still have representative
 
04:16:01.040 --> 04:16:01.990 align:start position:0%
okay so we still have representative
wallner's

04:16:01.990 --> 04:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
wallner's
 
04:16:04.630 --> 04:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
hand up i don't i don't know i'll take
 
04:16:05.030 --> 04:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
it down
 
04:16:09.429 --> 04:16:09.439 align:start position:0%
sorry uh representative weiler
 
04:16:12.710 --> 04:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
i was just going to add representative
 
04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
walnut questioned the process of
 
04:16:16.149 --> 04:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
why why did why didn't we go through
 
04:16:18.070 --> 04:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
line by line i remember doing that in
 
04:16:19.750 --> 04:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
the past and it started off okay we've
 
04:16:21.429 --> 04:16:21.439 align:start position:0%
got to reduce this by so much
 
04:16:23.349 --> 04:16:23.359 align:start position:0%
and you the first few years you'd reduce
 
04:16:25.269 --> 04:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
quite a bit and then
 
04:16:26.870 --> 04:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
or you didn't reduce enough and then
 
04:16:29.110 --> 04:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
later on you'd say oh we didn't reduce
 
04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
enough look we're halfway through and we
 
04:16:30.399 --> 04:16:30.950 align:start position:0%
enough look we're halfway through and we
haven't

04:16:30.950 --> 04:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
04:16:32.790 --> 04:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
reduced it in half so you start reducing
 
04:16:34.870 --> 04:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
more and but this way you started with
 
04:16:36.550 --> 04:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
everybody on an even l
 
04:16:39.110 --> 04:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
level and then you could talk about
 
04:16:40.070 --> 04:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
going back
 
04:16:42.229 --> 04:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
without doing the way we've sometimes
 
04:16:43.830 --> 04:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
done going line by line
 
04:16:46.630 --> 04:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
looking for reductions so i didn't think
 
04:16:48.389 --> 04:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
that i thought this was a superior
 
04:16:49.590 --> 04:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
method like
 
04:16:55.189 --> 04:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:58.389 --> 04:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh representative nordgren
 
04:17:01.510 --> 04:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair um this
 
04:17:04.950 --> 04:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
question is directed to represent weiler
 
04:17:08.229 --> 04:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
um i was wondering if maybe we could
 
04:17:11.429 --> 04:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
uh tell division one they need to take
 
04:17:13.030 --> 04:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
more than two million out of their
 
04:17:13.040 --> 04:17:14.550 align:start position:0%
more than two million out of their
budget

04:17:14.550 --> 04:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:17:17.830 --> 04:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
it seems like they got to decide what
 
04:17:18.950 --> 04:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
their number was
 
04:17:20.630 --> 04:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
and i didn't get to vote on what our
 
04:17:22.469 --> 04:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
number was
 
04:17:26.469 --> 04:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
no it was it was division two that only
 
04:17:30.070 --> 04:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
took a couple million
 
04:17:33.110 --> 04:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
division one took about 18 million and
 
04:17:35.349 --> 04:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
you know that's that seemed like a fair
 
04:17:36.550 --> 04:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
amount for them
 
04:17:39.990 --> 04:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we run into is is
 
04:17:43.750 --> 04:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
since the gas tax revenue is down so low
 
04:17:45.670 --> 04:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
the last couple of budgets i think we've
 
04:17:47.510 --> 04:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
had to take money out of
 
04:17:50.309 --> 04:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
general funds and put it into highway
 
04:17:50.319 --> 04:17:51.110 align:start position:0%
general funds and put it into highway
funds

04:17:51.110 --> 04:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
funds
 
04:17:52.790 --> 04:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
fortunately uh fish and game we didn't
 
04:17:54.469 --> 04:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
have to do that previous budgets i think
 
04:17:56.070 --> 04:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
we've given more money
 
04:17:57.990 --> 04:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
to uh fish and game from the general
 
04:17:59.750 --> 04:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
fund but i think
 
04:18:02.070 --> 04:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of money had to go to
 
04:18:03.189 --> 04:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
04:18:04.870 --> 04:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
because they're not earning the money
 
04:18:06.149 --> 04:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
and they're still the costs are still
 
04:18:07.750 --> 04:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
going up for paving and
 
04:18:10.229 --> 04:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
employees and so on so they're they're
 
04:18:11.110 --> 04:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
in a tough spot
 
04:18:13.349 --> 04:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
because of the revenues they're dealing
 
04:18:14.790 --> 04:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
with that decline
 
04:18:16.469 --> 04:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
and have to be filled in by general
 
04:18:19.030 --> 04:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
funds so that that was understood when
 
04:18:25.110 --> 04:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:28.550 --> 04:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
so if i could i'd like to take another
 
04:18:31.110 --> 04:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
crack at partially answering
 
04:18:33.030 --> 04:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative walner's question about
 
04:18:33.040 --> 04:18:34.229 align:start position:0%
representative walner's question about
this

04:18:34.229 --> 04:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
the reason for this approach selection
 
04:18:39.189 --> 04:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
04:18:42.710 --> 04:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
that um there was a significant amount
 
04:18:42.720 --> 04:18:43.590 align:start position:0%
that um there was a significant amount
of

04:18:43.590 --> 04:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
growth between fy21
 
04:18:50.790 --> 04:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
no wait a second let me get my numbers
 
04:18:50.800 --> 04:18:51.670 align:start position:0%
no wait a second let me get my numbers
right

04:18:51.670 --> 04:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:18:55.269 --> 04:18:55.279 align:start position:0%
the the previous budget ending in fy 19
 
04:18:59.030 --> 04:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
and the current budget ending in fy21
 
04:19:01.990 --> 04:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
there was a significant amount of growth
 
04:19:02.870 --> 04:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
in there
 
04:19:07.750 --> 04:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
that the department had not been able to
 
04:19:11.590 --> 04:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh internalize that should and and
 
04:19:14.229 --> 04:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of it was because god struck and
 
04:19:15.510 --> 04:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
we had the pandemic
 
04:19:18.950 --> 04:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
and and we should we had a hiring freeze
 
04:19:22.389 --> 04:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
and so so but a lot of the growth that
 
04:19:22.399 --> 04:19:23.110 align:start position:0%
and so so but a lot of the growth that
was

04:19:23.110 --> 04:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:19:27.510 --> 04:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
projected from 19 to 21
 
04:19:29.670 --> 04:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons just hadn't
 
04:19:29.680 --> 04:19:30.550 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons just hadn't
happened

04:19:30.550 --> 04:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
happened
 
04:19:32.870 --> 04:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
whether it was the pandemic whether it
 
04:19:32.880 --> 04:19:34.309 align:start position:0%
whether it was the pandemic whether it
was

04:19:34.309 --> 04:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:19:38.469 --> 04:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
working or worker shortages
 
04:19:41.510 --> 04:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh whether it was because the
 
04:19:44.630 --> 04:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
leadership was so focused on dealing
 
04:19:45.750 --> 04:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic
 
04:19:49.110 --> 04:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
that they weren't also able to focus on
 
04:19:51.429 --> 04:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
other things
 
04:19:54.790 --> 04:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
it was hard for me to look at the
 
04:19:56.309 --> 04:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
04:19:59.110 --> 04:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
and wrap my head around all of the
 
04:19:59.120 --> 04:20:00.149 align:start position:0%
and wrap my head around all of the
things

04:20:00.149 --> 04:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:20:02.630 --> 04:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
that that maybe really hadn't happened
 
04:20:03.510 --> 04:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
or or
 
04:20:07.429 --> 04:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
or only had happened to a partial extent
 
04:20:10.550 --> 04:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
and so so what i thought would be
 
04:20:10.560 --> 04:20:11.590 align:start position:0%
and so so what i thought would be
helpful

04:20:11.590 --> 04:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
04:20:14.229 --> 04:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
would to would be to get us down to a
 
04:20:16.229 --> 04:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
solid level base
 
04:20:19.110 --> 04:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
so that we could begin talking about
 
04:20:19.120 --> 04:20:19.590 align:start position:0%
so that we could begin talking about
what

04:20:19.590 --> 04:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:20:22.870 --> 04:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
what has happened and what we would want
 
04:20:24.149 --> 04:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
to resource to
 
04:20:27.510 --> 04:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
have it continue to happen so
 
04:20:28.950 --> 04:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
so i don't i don't know if that's
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
helpful but but that
 
04:20:32.950 --> 04:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
that that was part of my thinking at the
 
04:20:32.960 --> 04:20:36.149 align:start position:0%
that that was part of my thinking at the
time

04:20:36.149 --> 04:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:39.349 --> 04:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
i think we're where are we
 
04:20:46.070 --> 04:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
we are at the point where i
 
04:20:49.670 --> 04:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
had thought maybe we could do um
 
04:20:53.030 --> 04:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
a conversation around which
 
04:20:56.149 --> 04:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
which items we think we could or
 
04:20:59.429 --> 04:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
which activity codes that i thought we
 
04:21:00.870 --> 04:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
could agree on
 
04:21:03.189 --> 04:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
quickly so we could just take them off
 
04:21:04.550 --> 04:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
the plate
 
04:21:07.670 --> 04:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
earlier we had talked about just
 
04:21:07.680 --> 04:21:08.389 align:start position:0%
earlier we had talked about just
accepting

04:21:08.389 --> 04:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
accepting
 
04:21:11.429 --> 04:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
all of the funds uh or all of the
 
04:21:11.439 --> 04:21:11.910 align:start position:0%
all of the funds uh or all of the
account

04:21:11.910 --> 04:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
account
 
04:21:15.269 --> 04:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
uh accounts where it was federal funds
 
04:21:15.279 --> 04:21:16.229 align:start position:0%
uh accounts where it was federal funds
only

04:21:16.229 --> 04:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
only
 
04:21:20.229 --> 04:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
just just go ahead and have uh
 
04:21:23.030 --> 04:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
mr ripple move those off to the side and
 
04:21:25.189 --> 04:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
we'll quit talking about them
 
04:21:28.149 --> 04:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
that was one category and then uh
 
04:21:29.510 --> 04:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
earlier today
 
04:21:32.870 --> 04:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
um representative nordgren sent a couple
 
04:21:32.880 --> 04:21:33.189 align:start position:0%
um representative nordgren sent a couple
of

04:21:33.189 --> 04:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:21:36.790 --> 04:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh activity level like the health equity
 
04:21:36.800 --> 04:21:37.590 align:start position:0%
uh activity level like the health equity
line

04:21:37.590 --> 04:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:21:40.710 --> 04:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
the office commissioner line
 
04:21:43.110 --> 04:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
but that was before we had an
 
04:21:45.030 --> 04:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to describe
 
04:21:48.630 --> 04:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
this baseline approach so if you guys
 
04:21:51.510 --> 04:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
want to go back and double check that
 
04:21:51.520 --> 04:21:52.229 align:start position:0%
want to go back and double check that
you're

04:21:52.229 --> 04:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:21:55.349 --> 04:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
that those are easy to do uh
 
04:21:58.229 --> 04:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
approvals uh you know then we can do
 
04:21:58.239 --> 04:21:58.790 align:start position:0%
approvals uh you know then we can do
that

04:21:58.790 --> 04:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:22:01.910 --> 04:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
on on thursday
 
04:22:04.710 --> 04:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
but is on this idea of just basically
 
04:22:04.720 --> 04:22:05.510 align:start position:0%
but is on this idea of just basically
accepting

04:22:05.510 --> 04:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
accepting
 
04:22:09.590 --> 04:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
all of these with federal funds only
 
04:22:10.950 --> 04:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
is there is there anyone that
 
04:22:14.389 --> 04:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:18.309 --> 04:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
no no i don't i don't think so so
 
04:22:21.510 --> 04:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
so um so i think
 
04:22:24.550 --> 04:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
miss ripple you know that's it's kind of
 
04:22:26.389 --> 04:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
obvious but miss rounds and you and
 
04:22:28.309 --> 04:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
everyone can just anticipate
 
04:22:30.630 --> 04:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
that we're that all the lines that the
 
04:22:32.229 --> 04:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
federal funds only we're not going to be
 
04:22:34.870 --> 04:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
coming back to
 
04:22:38.229 --> 04:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
okay so i'll provide you a list of all
 
04:22:40.469 --> 04:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
federal funds only
 
04:22:42.309 --> 04:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
accounting units that you can then take
 
04:22:44.309 --> 04:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
a formal vote on
 
04:22:47.189 --> 04:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
in a future meeting yes please i think
 
04:22:49.670 --> 04:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful
 
04:22:52.870 --> 04:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
okay um i so i
 
04:22:55.189 --> 04:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
i think uh i think i'm we're through
 
04:22:56.070 --> 04:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
with the agenda
 
04:22:58.550 --> 04:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
that we had for today uh representative
 
04:22:59.990 --> 04:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
weiler wanted to finish well
 
04:23:01.670 --> 04:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
before three so he could get ready for
 
04:23:03.269 --> 04:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
his next meeting
 
04:23:05.510 --> 04:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh or is it for the good of the
 
04:23:07.110 --> 04:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
committee are there just any general
 
04:23:08.229 --> 04:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
comments we've
 
04:23:09.830 --> 04:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
we've sort of done a bunch of different
 
04:23:12.149 --> 04:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
things today and so
 
04:23:13.590 --> 04:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
if there's anything we've done that you
 
04:23:15.189 --> 04:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
want to revisit
 
04:23:17.830 --> 04:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
or or perspective things this is a good
 
04:23:18.469 --> 04:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
time to
 
04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:24.070 --> 04:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren you've been down
 
04:23:32.389 --> 04:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:35.429 --> 04:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm still not sure
 
04:23:38.469 --> 04:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
i understand your home plan of how we're
 
04:23:40.229 --> 04:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
getting to where we're getting in the
 
04:23:40.239 --> 04:23:41.189 align:start position:0%
getting to where we're getting in the
end

04:23:41.189 --> 04:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
end
 
04:23:45.269 --> 04:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
um but i'll await more instruction
 
04:23:48.630 --> 04:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
thanks okay so if if we were just
 
04:23:48.640 --> 04:23:49.110 align:start position:0%
thanks okay so if if we were just
sitting

04:23:49.110 --> 04:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
sitting
 
04:23:51.510 --> 04:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
in the same room together what i would
 
04:23:53.510 --> 04:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
do is i would pull out
 
04:23:56.229 --> 04:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
with you i would pull out the line by
 
04:23:56.239 --> 04:23:56.710 align:start position:0%
with you i would pull out the line by
line

04:23:56.710 --> 04:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:23:59.510 --> 04:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
excel sheet that that keith is sending
 
04:24:00.790 --> 04:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
us all or has sent
 
04:24:04.149 --> 04:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
us and in that you would see what he
 
04:24:07.510 --> 04:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
considers to be our baseline
 
04:24:10.070 --> 04:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
and if you like that big line that
 
04:24:10.080 --> 04:24:10.550 align:start position:0%
and if you like that big line that
that's

04:24:10.550 --> 04:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:24:13.670 --> 04:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
in there then we can just all agree to
 
04:24:15.189 --> 04:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
that probably
 
04:24:17.750 --> 04:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
if you think the baseline is too low and
 
04:24:18.950 --> 04:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
you want to add back
 
04:24:22.309 --> 04:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
on that line that will be a discussion
 
04:24:24.309 --> 04:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
for thursday and later
 
04:24:26.790 --> 04:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
so it is you you now i think are
 
04:24:26.800 --> 04:24:27.990 align:start position:0%
so it is you you now i think are
empowered

04:24:27.990 --> 04:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
empowered
 
04:24:31.510 --> 04:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
to take the line by line and say okay
 
04:24:34.550 --> 04:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
accounting code 5608 or whatever
 
04:24:38.229 --> 04:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
it is 5608 general funds are
 
04:24:41.189 --> 04:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
