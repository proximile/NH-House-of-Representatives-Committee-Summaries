of individuals based on biological sex
 
00:19:59.230 --> 00:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
under certain
 
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances and this identical bill

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
fact that there are certain
 
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which recognition of
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
biological sex may be necessary for the
 
00:20:27.549 --> 00:20:27.559 align:start position:0%
physical safety and privacy rights of an
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
individual especially when but not
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
limited to minors the three
 
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which this bill permits
 
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
biological sex to be utilized as a basis
 
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
for classification are limited to
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
multiple use bathrooms athletic or
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
sporting events of a um of a Kind where
 
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
an advantage to biological males is
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
recognized to exist and Facilities where
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
an individual is committed volun
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
involuntarily even in these limited
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
situations the build does not require
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
classification based on biological sex
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
it merely allows for this to occur if
 
00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
the institution in question determines
 
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
the same as necessary now during the
 
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
hearing there was some concern expressed
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
regarding the definition of biological
 
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
sex and until recently there was really
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
no problem or significant need to
 
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
routinely define specific different
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
characteristics of what make a person
 
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
male or
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
female it is now possible to perform an
 
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
atome test for gender identity on a
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
fetus as young as 6 to 8 weeks gestation
 
00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:36.919 align:start position:0%
this is done by taking a sample of the
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
mother's blood and testing for the
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
presence of male DNA the absence of male
 
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
DNA means the unborn child is most
 
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.990 align:start position:0%
DNA means the unborn child is most
likely

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
female those tests are available at your
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
local drugstore like Walgreens CVS you
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
can also order them
 
00:21:59.710 --> 00:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
online on February 19th the same date as
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
the hearing for House Bill 148 the US
 
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
took action on the current
 
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
administration's executive order
 
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
defending women and children this
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
includes a definition of biological
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
sex failure to maintain sex-based
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
distinctions could now possibly put
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
federal education and Public Safety
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
funding at risk according to the
 
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
executive order defending women from
 
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
gender ideology
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
recent events both nationally and
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
locally indicate the need for this
 
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
legislation in Maine just last week a
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
state representative was censured and
 
00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
silenced for drawing attention to
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
biological males participating in female
 
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
sports and their unfair
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
Advantage the state of Maine is speaking
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
out one quote that I heard as I was
 
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
paying attention the news cycle last
 
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
week was from a young girl who said that
 
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
now she doesn't have to fight this alone
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
well shame on us adults we shouldn't be
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
allowing children to fight this fight
 
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
for us for themselves I should say in
 
00:23:11.149 --> 00:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
our own state two female athletes have
 
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
signed on to the lawsuit challenging our
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
own women in sports
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
law with wide swings and executive
 
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:20.440 align:start position:0%
orders between administrations House
 
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
Bill 148 is necessary and The Time Is
 
00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:26.679 align:start position:0%
Now to protect our women and girls in
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
the granite state
 
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard
 
00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.630 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard
representative

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
tur yeah thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
take uh for allowing me to comment um I
 
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
imp opposed to this bill on on a a
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
number of grounds I
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
think I I'll open up by saying and I
 
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
don't mean this offensively it it's it's
 
00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
almost legislative malpractice it seems
 
00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
to me to put a bill out that not only
 
00:23:59.549 --> 00:23:59.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually Define the key
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
terminology which is biological sex and
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying what your
 
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
Precision on it is but it's not embodied
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
in the bill um there are as I mentioned
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
during the hearing at least four four
 
00:24:12.799 --> 00:24:14.789 align:start position:0%
during the hearing at least four four
approaches

00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
approaches
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
to defining biological sex um and these
 
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
can be changed either naturally or
 
00:24:25.149 --> 00:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
through uh medical intervention through
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
through throughout your life um guess
 
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
what i' what I'd like to say and and
 
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
hope that folks um around the table will
 
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:36.919 align:start position:0%
consider when voting on this is the
 
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
thing that this bill intends to
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
solve seems like it will almost be
 
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
caused by this bill and give me one
 
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
minute to explain that I won't go on too
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
long if we choose chromosomes and by the
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
way there's more than two versions of
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
chromosomes um alone but if we choose
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
that we're basically saying you know it
 
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's your identity your gender your
 
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:11.240 align:start position:0%
Birth there's there's actual history
 
00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.430 align:start position:0%
Birth there's there's actual history
here

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
where forcing someone to say join a
 
00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
sports team based on their sex at Birth
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
causes the exact problem that I think
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
folks are trying to
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
avoid and that is say in sports hormones
 
00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.870 align:start position:0%
avoid and that is say in sports hormones
determine

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
determine
 
00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
your musculature hormones determine your
 
00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.070 align:start position:0%
your musculature hormones determine your
your

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
physique um there's a story from from uh
 
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:43.640 align:start position:0%
Texas where uh a trans youth named Mt
 
00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
begs um was forced by a bill just like
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
this to
 
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
play on a women's sports team for
 
00:25:55.389 --> 00:25:55.399 align:start position:0%
wrestling he was a wrestler um born a
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
female now a male presents as a
 
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
male uh was forced to wrestle on the
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
girls wrestling team he became the
 
00:26:04.919 --> 00:26:06.830 align:start position:0%
girls wrestling team he became the
undefeated

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
undefeated
 
00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
undefeated uh wrestling champion of the
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
State of Texas for two years in a
 
00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
row um against his will he did not want
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
to wrestle on the girls team I I just
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
want to put that out there this does not
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
and this does not even say you have to
 
00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:26.919 align:start position:0%
treat the two genders that way the
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
school across town could choose to treat
 
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:31.559 align:start position:0%
it the opposite way there is no
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
definition in here about
 
00:26:37.149 --> 00:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about for the two
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
genders and even if we knew what we were
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
talking about for the two genders how
 
00:26:44.389 --> 00:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
those should be embraced different
 
00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
restaurants could choose different
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
standards for for what bathroom and one
 
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
place you could be forced to go in one
 
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
the other place you could be forced to
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
go in another depending on whether it's
 
00:26:58.029 --> 00:26:58.039 align:start position:0%
the way you look today or it's the way
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
you you looked when you were born or
 
00:27:02.669 --> 00:27:02.679 align:start position:0%
some other standard I'll set aside the
 
00:27:05.789 --> 00:27:05.799 align:start position:0%
privacy concerns about how anyone would
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
actually um adjudicate whether or not
 
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
the person in question would or wouldn't
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
be treated a certain way according to
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
this so I just hope people will pause
 
00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
and say you know do you really want your
 
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559 align:start position:0%
constituents calling and saying why is a
 
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
person with a beard wrestling on our um
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
on our girls team and the answer would
 
00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
be because of this bill because this
 
00:27:36.909 --> 00:27:36.919 align:start position:0%
bill allows that um it doesn't say what
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
way the the advantage needs to run so I
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
I will stop there but I I I I I I I just
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
want to make it really clear that that I
 
00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
think this is dangerous and I think this
 
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
is this is because it lacks the
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
Integrity to actually Define what it's
 
00:27:55.789 --> 00:27:55.799 align:start position:0%
trying to say leaves the door wide open
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
for for discrimination in the worst
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
possible alwayss thanks other people
 
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
representative organ um yes first of all
 
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
the uh I guess I reiterate without going
 
00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:10.039 align:start position:0%
on too much length the chromosomes do
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
not necessarily determine what your
 
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
gender expression is and of course what
 
00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
really counts is your gender gender
 
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
identity what you believe yourself what
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
you believe yourself to be and what
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
other people expect to be which is not
 
00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily what you're assigned to to
 
00:28:27.149 --> 00:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
birth and then what you're assigned to
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
birth doesn't necessarily match up with
 
00:28:30.269 --> 00:28:30.279 align:start position:0%
the chromosomes so these chromosome
 
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
tests you can buy a Walgreens um that's
 
00:28:36.909 --> 00:28:36.919 align:start position:0%
um not really that what you do in the
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
what you do with the with the embryo
 
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't really necessarily determine
 
00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:45.519 align:start position:0%
like what the child will be U when it's
 
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
um when it's born and um so there's uh
 
00:28:51.149 --> 00:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
you know there's many people who do not
 
00:28:53.789 --> 00:28:53.799 align:start position:0%
fall on one side of the uh gender line
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
or the or the other so they should uh
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
they have the same rights as everyone
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
everyone else and also of course any
 
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
definition of biological sex is totally
 
00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:05.720 align:start position:0%
absent from this bill and um you know
 
00:29:07.389 --> 00:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
think I asked the prime sponsor about
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
and he just sort of shrugged it off say
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
everybody knows what it is um you know
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
certainly a bad definition is worse than
 
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
no definition at all and c and
 
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
um so I just I probably just think this
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is unnecessary and you know in
 
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
terms of the three circumstances there
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's already regardless of uh
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
regardless what your crimin romes are or
 
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
what what your gender identity
 
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
expression is you know it's illegal to
 
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
um it's it's illegal to assault or
 
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
harass someone in any public any setting
 
00:29:41.509 --> 00:29:41.519 align:start position:0%
including know including the laboratory
 
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
U the prisons already of the right to uh
 
00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
and the duty to put prisoners um where
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
they where they're the least danger to
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
themselves and to the other prisoners
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
and um and the sports the sports teams
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
can uh sporting competitions can and do
 
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
like determine the rules for who's
 
00:30:03.509 --> 00:30:03.519 align:start position:0%
eligible eligible to participate and
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
there's only three cases in high school
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
sports here in New Hampshire and um I
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
think I believe all the
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
three trans young trans women truly are
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
truly are women and soly the record
 
00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:17.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't show that any of them have an
 
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
unfair Advantage you know their teams
 
00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
have not been any more successful more
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
or less successful any the other team so
 
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
that's uh I just feels well was totally
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and finally there's
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
reference to like Department of Health
 
00:30:32.909 --> 00:30:32.919 align:start position:0%
and Human Services uh Federal at the
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
federal level they're I think they're
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
mirroring what the president executive
 
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
order was and his executive order was
 
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
very badly worded in fact the way I read
 
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
it and of course I'm not necessarily A a
 
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not say an expert on genetics but
 
00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
the world way I read it seems like
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
everybody in the room is female the
 
00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
including those of us like me who
 
00:30:56.629 --> 00:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
present as male and believe themselves
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
the male um you know so apparently he he
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
he he put out an executive order which
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
apparently means that everybody in this
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
room including the men are are females
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
so that's I wouldn't go by that
 
00:31:09.149 --> 00:31:09.159 align:start position:0%
definition at all so it was just this BS
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
just feels just unnecessary
 
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
counterproductive and uh should be uh
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
should be found inexpedient to legislate
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
so all right other anyone else wish to
 
00:31:22.269 --> 00:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you I wonder if I could ask
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
a question of um the maker of the motion
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
um I I was fascinated
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
about uh the part about the test that
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
you could take at home um is there a
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
requirement for people to take that test
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
I I'm showing my age of course but one
 
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
wonderful moments was uh when in my two
 
00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.549 align:start position:0%
wonderful moments was uh when in my two
pregnant

00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
pregnant
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
when what emerged was a surprise to me
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
um the first was a a male and the second
 
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
was a female
 
00:32:12.269 --> 00:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
and we had no idea until then and I
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
believe that there are people now who
 
00:32:18.909 --> 00:32:18.919 align:start position:0%
choose not to know
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
um is this something that's a
 
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
requirement I mean that talk about
 
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:30.509 --> 00:32:30.519 align:start position:0%
this would be a really fun conversation
 
00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
to have in private however since we're
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
not in private I was stunned to find out
 
00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
that this test was a possibility that
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
you could do it at home in fact a friend
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
of mine emailed me a picture of the test
 
00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:48.919 align:start position:0%
during the hearing on 148 two weeks ago
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
and I I hadn't realized that such a
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
thing was possible but it's quite common
 
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
now for people to find out what the sex
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
of their child is going to be through an
 
00:33:02.509 --> 00:33:02.519 align:start position:0%
ultrasound typically I thought until I
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
found out about this test um and then
 
00:33:07.629 --> 00:33:07.639 align:start position:0%
they have gender reveal parties and all
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
kinds of things but I I miss the days I
 
00:33:13.629 --> 00:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
have to say of the surprise like oh you
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
had a girl you have a girl oh you have a
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
boy those that mystery is kind of
 
00:33:21.629 --> 00:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
escapes us these days thank you other
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to comment seeing none
 
00:33:27.629 --> 00:33:27.639 align:start position:0%
I think we're ready uh for a vote on the
 
00:33:27.639 --> 00:33:28.549 align:start position:0%
I think we're ready uh for a vote on the

by representative Smith um and I'm going

to um this bill has you know we we we P
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
the house passed this bill last year I
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
think everybody is kind of familiar with
 
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
it um my I'm going to just speak very
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
briefly in support of it I think to me
 
00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is about Liberty it's about
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
the question of whether or not I should
 
00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
have the ability um
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
assuming I'm I meet all the requirements
 
00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:04.599 align:start position:0%
of the bill as as repres as reflected by
 
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:06.839 align:start position:0%
uh two doctors and if necessary a
 
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
psychologist or psychiatrist or whatever
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
if I meet all those requirements should
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
I have the option and I'm within six
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
months of death should I have the option
 
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
of being able to end my death in a
 
00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
peaceful manner as opposed to suffering
 
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
uh until I die I know that there are
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
strong religious beliefs and other
 
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
beliefs on on the other side of the
 
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
aisle and you know I I expect everyone
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
will built their conscience uh to me my
 
00:36:34.109 --> 00:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
conscience says that this bill should
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
pass and I hope that um you will agree
 
00:36:39.069 --> 00:36:39.079 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to speak
 
00:36:39.079 --> 00:36:41.910 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to speak
representative

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:45.079 align:start position:0%
Perez I feel very strongly against this
 
00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
bill because not the intent of the bill
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
because I have one side of me that is
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
the religious side but I have the other
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
side that is the legislator side So
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
based on the legislator side
 
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
this is a faulty faulty bill it is an
 
00:37:05.069 --> 00:37:05.079 align:start position:0%
extreme we already have in this country
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
that anorexics are able to get hold of
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
the are able to utilize this and the
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
state veteran advisory commission which
 
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:19.240 align:start position:0%
reports to the governor 20 veteran
 
00:37:23.069 --> 00:37:23.079 align:start position:0%
services organizations voted unanimously
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
to oppose this bill for its second
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
this thank you all right anyone else
 
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
wish to be heard representative
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
Andrew thank you Mr chair I'm just going
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
to make this brief I've been around for
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
a long time I have seen painfully things
 
00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
in my family
 
00:37:52.309 --> 00:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
that some would say they should maybe
 
00:37:56.829 --> 00:37:56.839 align:start position:0%
take a pill I just can't go there to me
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
a doctor
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
takes an
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
oath to save life and we're going to
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
pass a bill where a doctor can give
 
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
somebody a
 
00:38:10.589 --> 00:38:10.599 align:start position:0%
pill and and so they can pass on I just
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
don't think it's right and I will vote
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
against this bill again like I did last
 
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
year thank you all right anyone else
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
wish to be heard yes representative pno
 
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair yes I am also
 
00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:25.079 align:start position:0%
adamantly opposed to this bill um and I
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
won't even go into the details within
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
however I find the subject to be
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
exceptionally deceptive every time the
 
00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
bill is presented it has a different
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
name a different
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
euphemism um to Cloud the issue and so
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
from the start I find the the bill to be
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
deceptive and at the end where the cause
 
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
of death is the underlying illness not
 
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
the ingestion of the medication that
 
00:38:58.990 --> 00:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
actually causes the death that level of
 
00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
deception um we would NE we will never
 
00:39:06.309 --> 00:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
know how many people actually die this
 
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
way if we don't have the truth about how
 
00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.109 align:start position:0%
way if we don't have the truth about how
people

00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
die or how they end their
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
lives or whether or not they die
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
naturally I I just the certainly cannot
 
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
vote for deceptive legislation like this
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard so the last
 
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
I I guess I I do feel necessary to
 
00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
respond to one of the things you said
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh panel because it you
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
know I I thought about this when during
 
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
the hearing when somebody made basically
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
the argument you're making and as I
 
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
thought it through I I think one of the
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
things that that is important to
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
understand is this it is true that this
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
bill defines someone who dies meeting
 
00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:52.839 align:start position:0%
the meeting the circumstances of what
 
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
the uh which I think are pretty
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
stringent of what the bill requires as
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
not being a suicide now you might say
 
00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:03.079 align:start position:0%
well that's deceptive that's a lie the
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
analogy I would draw is we have in
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
various areas of the law and I would
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
draw in particular the case of of
 
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
expungement of criminal records the law
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
says that somebody who has been
 
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
convicted of a crime can apply and if
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
they meet the requirements to have their
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
their convictions expunged then they are
 
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
no longer convicted and they can answer
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
questions on an employment application
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
and all of those things to say no I have
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
not been convicted now you might say
 
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
that's a lot they really have been
 
00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
convicted but the law has said look the
 
00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
these are in these circumstances we
 
00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
think it's appropriate to allow the
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
person to be sort of rehabilitated I
 
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
think the same by analogy the same
 
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
situation applies here the law can say
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
if you are if you have a terminal
 
00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
illness and you're within 6 months of
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
death and you don't really you know
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
those those people don't want to die but
 
00:41:01.309 --> 00:41:01.319 align:start position:0%
what they also don't want to do is to
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
suffer in the last moment last hours of
 
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
or days of their death they um and they
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
want to be able to end their their lives
 
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
peacefully I think the law can
 
00:41:14.829 --> 00:41:14.839 align:start position:0%
appropriately say that we won't we won't
 
00:41:17.069 --> 00:41:17.079 align:start position:0%
classify those people as having
 
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
committed suicide so that I think that's
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
representative uh uh
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
Perez we're not talking about a criminal
 
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking about someone's life kill
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
literally taking their life my biggest
 
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
concern is if we justify suicide at the
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
state level the young people who now are
 
00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
between the first or second cause of
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
death up to the age of 34 will feel that
 
00:41:51.119 --> 00:41:52.750 align:start position:0%
death up to the age of 34 will feel that
their

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
depression is a terminal
 
00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
illness and feel that well the state
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
says it's okay to do this even though
 
00:42:05.069 --> 00:42:05.079 align:start position:0%
they're not doing it through this
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide we're
 
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
justifying we're
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
justifying The Taking of a human life
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
and our
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
platform I'm a republican our platform
 
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
totally 100% against it that's not why
 
00:42:26.349 --> 00:42:26.359 align:start position:0%
I'm voting against it I'm voting against
 
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
the bill is faulty we already have other
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
people ingesting the medications and not
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
the person who it was for we have
 
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
anorexics who are young who are being
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
given this it the slippery slope has
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
started in the United
 
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
States anyone else wish to be
 
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
heard representative
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
tur yeah just a couple of thoughts um
 
00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:55.640 align:start position:0%
let me first talk about the the uh death
 
00:42:58.349 --> 00:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
certificate issue um you know as someone
 
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
who's worked with Public Health Data for
 
00:43:04.829 --> 00:43:04.839 align:start position:0%
my whole life um it's important not to I
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
think in if if in a law like this
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
allow the confusion of the cause of
 
00:43:14.829 --> 00:43:14.839 align:start position:0%
death which we use to understand the
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
changes of disease statuses in our
 
00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:20.559 align:start position:0%
society with something that if this were
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
permitted would be exercising a legal
 
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
right that you have to prevent
 
00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:31.400 align:start position:0%
suffering if we pervert this so that all
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
of these things were to become somehow
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
caused by the exercise of this what
 
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
would be legal right that you have we're
 
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
basically throwing out the ability to
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
study things like changes in cancer
 
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
rates and changes in um in mortality um
 
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
so I I think it's important to have a
 
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
provision like this for that reason um
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
the only other thing I'd like to say is
 
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the the underly in I
 
00:43:58.990 --> 00:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
guess I'll call it
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
morality I think it's important to make
 
00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.349 align:start position:0%
morality I think it's important to make
the

00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:02.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
distinction with medicine and and the
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
the the the oath you take is to do no
 
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
harm first um
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
that suicide is about ending a otherwise
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
ongoing life um medicine knows the
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
difference between somebody who is
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
living and somebody who is terminally
 
00:44:28.829 --> 00:44:28.839 align:start position:0%
dying and it's not in my mind possible
 
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
to call something suicide if the outcome
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
in Fairly short order is death you are
 
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
dying you're not taking your life um
 
00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
maybe that's a distinction that that
 
00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
others disagree with but I think it's an
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
important one and I just wanted to
 
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
mention it thanks anyone else wish to be
 
00:44:48.549 --> 00:44:48.559 align:start position:0%

I will take a moment to speak to this
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
um the the amendment in question is a
 
00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
replace all Amendment it replaces the
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
bill the purpose of the bill as
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
originally drafted would have been
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
essentially to say that the office of
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
Cost Containment needs to end efforts to
 
00:48:58.349 --> 00:48:58.359 align:start position:0%
recoup um monies that uh will provide uh
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
funds that were expended to provide um
 
00:49:05.789 --> 00:49:05.799 align:start position:0%
uh Council services and related services
 
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
for um Indigent PE uh Indigent defend
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
criminal defendants or juveniles who are
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
charged with juvenile delinquency
 
00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.430 align:start position:0%
charged with juvenile delinquency
offenses

00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
um my
 
00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:20.390 align:start position:0%
um my
Amendment

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
basically replaces the that entire bill
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
with a with an amendment that
 
00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
essentially restores the law to what it
 
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
was prior to 20 to the 2020 amendments
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
to RSA uh 604
 
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
A9 um and in
 
00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.670 align:start position:0%
A9 um and in
particular

00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
um it was those amendments passed when
 
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
um the our our uh friends on the other
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
side of the aisle were in control of the
 
00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
legislature um that um basically did a
 
00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:57.559 align:start position:0%
number of things one of the things is
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
that it made it said that if you were if
 
00:50:02.109 --> 00:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
you were provided the services of if you
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
were Indigent provided the services of
 
00:50:05.789 --> 00:50:05.799 align:start position:0%
council and you were found not guilty
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
the state could not um attempt to recoup
 
00:50:11.789 --> 00:50:11.799 align:start position:0%
uh the funds from you um I think that is
 
00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
totally totally inappropriate um because
 
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
if you or I are are charged with an
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
Defence and we retain our own lawyer and
 
00:50:23.069 --> 00:50:23.079 align:start position:0%
we're found not guilty we don't get to
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
charge the state for uh the funds for
 
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
the expense we paid for our lawyer um I
 
00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
think basically and and in incidentally
 
00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
if you read the fiscal note to this uh
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
to the original bill it indicates that
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
there was a huge drop off in the amount
 
00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
of money that the office of Cost
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
Containment collected after that change
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
in the law was made because the other
 
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
thing that that that that that the law
 
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
that that law in 2020 did is it
 
00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
basically said if the if the judge
 
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
decides that the person can't afford to
 
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
pay there's no reexamination of it that
 
00:51:02.789 --> 00:51:02.799 align:start position:0%
that cannot be reexamined by the office
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
of Cost Containment I think it's really
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
important that everyone understand this
 
00:51:10.109 --> 00:51:10.119 align:start position:0%
point and I I you know I've signed
 
00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:12.440 align:start position:0%
hundreds of those uh maybe thousands of
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
those appointment of counsel things and
 
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
as as every other judge did when during
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
the time that I was a judge it's
 
00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
important to understand there is in the
 
00:51:27.069 --> 00:51:27.079 align:start position:0%
judicial branch there is no I mean it
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
would be an extraordinary circumstance
 
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
where there was actually any checking of
 
00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
whether the information contained in the
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
financial affidavit is accurate when
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
somebody files a financial affidavit and
 
00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:42.280 align:start position:0%
say you know in support of getting a
 
00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.870 align:start position:0%
say you know in support of getting a
appointed

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
counsel unless there's something on the
 
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
face of it that makes the makes the
 
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
judge say wait a minute this this
 
00:51:52.589 --> 00:51:52.599 align:start position:0%
there's something wrong which is almost
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
never the
 
00:51:56.109 --> 00:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
case the judges and the court system
 
00:51:58.829 --> 00:51:58.839 align:start position:0%
they don't have any any uh uh
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
investigators to go out and or they have
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
neither the time nor the inclination to
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
go and check that so you sign off on it
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
and so there is really no you know un
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
unless you know I suppose if Bill Gates
 
00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
came in and and filed an affidavit
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
seeking appointed counsel and somebody
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
said you know to the judge hey you know
 
00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
that's Bill Gates out there maybe the
 
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
judge would do would would uh would do a
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
you know a further inquiry but that in
 
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
the real world where that doesn't happen
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
there isn't any further inquiry so if if
 
00:52:34.589 --> 00:52:34.599 align:start position:0%
we don't have a situation where the
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
office of Cost Containment can actually
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
conduct an investigation to try to
 
00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
collect money it will it will not happen
 
00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:44.390 align:start position:0%
collect money it will it will not happen
to

00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
me the the whole idea of of the original
 
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
bill is what you know is based on I
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
guess what I would say it's the it's the
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
the sort of B discrimination of low
 
00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:01.720 align:start position:0%
expectations it basically says you know
 
00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:03.880 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're one of those poor
 
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
people we can't expect very much from
 
00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
you we can't expect you to have to you
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
know uh live up to your financial
 
00:53:13.109 --> 00:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
obligations you're just we're just going
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
to have to you know uh uh uh bite the
 
00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
bullet and pay for you and uh we don't
 
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't expect you to have to repay
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
even if you have the financial ability
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
to do that and bear in mind that is the
 
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
if there if the judge finds that there
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
isn't any Financial ability or if the co
 
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:33.400 align:start position:0%
office of Cost Containment finds that
 
00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
there isn't any Financial ability then
 
00:53:39.069 --> 00:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
that's fine um but but it shouldn't be
 
00:53:41.309 --> 00:53:41.319 align:start position:0%
the case that there's just going to be
 
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
sort of no inquiry into that um so I
 
00:53:46.349 --> 00:53:46.359 align:start position:0%
feel very strongly that that the
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
amendment is appropriate that it will
 
00:53:52.109 --> 00:53:52.119 align:start position:0%
restore the law to where it was um prior
 
00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
to 2020 um when there when the uh office
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
of cost containment was actually
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
collecting I think it was like $1.9
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
million or something like that it's a
 
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
fairly significant amount of money that
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
they were collecting um and so for those
 
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
reasons I uh hope you'll support the
 
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
amendment Mr chair representative
 
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
bur thank you um I
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
disagree and I want to
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
explain what happens on a non infrequent
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
basis Johnny is charged with with
 
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
burglary couple neighbors
 
00:54:33.789 --> 00:54:33.799 align:start position:0%
said yeah we think that was Johnny who
 
00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
was coming out of the house and pick him
 
00:54:41.069 --> 00:54:41.079 align:start position:0%
out of a lineup Johnny is charged Johnny
 
00:54:44.349 --> 00:54:44.359 align:start position:0%
is Indigent fills that a form so that he
 
00:54:47.309 --> 00:54:47.319 align:start position:0%
can get with the Constitution guarantees
 
00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
him which is a
 
00:54:53.309 --> 00:54:53.319 align:start position:0%
lawyer unfortunately he sits in jail for
 
00:54:53.319 --> 00:54:54.789 align:start position:0%
lawyer unfortunately he sits in jail for
bail

00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
bail
 
00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
reasons and weeks go by months go by and
 
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
someone else is picked up on some
 
00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:04.430 align:start position:0%
someone else is picked up on some
similar

00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
burglaries and that person confesses to
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
the other burglaries and
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
confesses to the charge for which
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
Johnny's been sitting in
 
00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:17.720 align:start position:0%
jail so Johnny comes back into court
 
00:55:20.349 --> 00:55:20.359 align:start position:0%
with his courta appointed lawyer and the
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
judge issues an apology on behalf of the
 
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
state and says we're really sorry you
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
know we know your life's been turned
 
00:55:31.029 --> 00:55:31.039 align:start position:0%
upside down we know that uh your kids
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
now been investigated by Social Services
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
we know all the hars that have gone on
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
to you we can't repair them but we feel
 
00:55:43.029 --> 00:55:43.039 align:start position:0%
bad about it and by the way on the way
 
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
out here's a bill for
 
00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
$4,000 now we know you have no money but
 
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
we have a mechanism where we will done
 
00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
you for the money based on our guess as
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
to your future ability to pay so not
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
only has the
 
00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
state ruined your life not as only has
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
the state said it was wrong what
 
00:56:11.309 --> 00:56:11.319 align:start position:0%
happened but we're going to bill you for
 
00:56:15.309 --> 00:56:15.319 align:start position:0%
what we did and we're going to D you and
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
every time you change your address for
 
00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:20.440 align:start position:0%
the next six years or whatever you
 
00:56:23.029 --> 00:56:23.039 align:start position:0%
better tell us because you're required
 
00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
by law to do so and it's etc etc if we
 
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
reach the point
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
now where we are
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
saying to a totally innocent Granite
 
00:56:41.069 --> 00:56:41.079 align:start position:0%
stator who has done nothing wrong who
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
got caught up in the
 
00:56:47.069 --> 00:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
system and saying who availed himself or
 
00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:49.839 align:start position:0%
herself of a right
 
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
guaranteed by the US
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution and we're going to say who
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
who cares that you are innocent we are
 
00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
above you we are the
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
government we are going to bill you for
 
00:57:08.829 --> 00:57:08.839 align:start position:0%
what we did to you and I just think at a
 
00:57:13.109 --> 00:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
very very fundamental level of who we
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
are at Granite Staters as granted
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
Staters that that is fundamentally wrong
 
00:57:20.829 --> 00:57:20.839 align:start position:0%
and by the way we will do that to
 
00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
children too who are charged with
 
00:57:25.829 --> 00:57:25.839 align:start position:0%
delinquency and found oh they weren't
 
00:57:25.839 --> 00:57:27.029 align:start position:0%
delinquency and found oh they weren't
delin

00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:27.039 align:start position:0%
delin
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
and that kid that child is going to be
 
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
dunned until he or she reaches the age
 
00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.710 align:start position:0%
dunned until he or she reaches the age
of

00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:57:38.029 --> 00:57:38.039 align:start position:0%
majority there's something I just think
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
when we look at ourselves and say is
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
this the kind of society that we want I
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
hope people you know vote against this
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
amendment anyone else wish to be heard
 
00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:52.510 align:start position:0%
amendment anyone else wish to be heard
representative

00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:57:56.829 --> 00:57:56.839 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair um
 
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
I I I do want to begin by saying that I
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
hope you didn't
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
mean to
 
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
um speak uh
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
authoritatively on the motives of those
 
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
people who acted um five years ago to
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
change um the
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
existing uh law when you
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
um announce why those people in
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
support of the change reach that
 
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
decision I was
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
somewhat unnerved by the the the
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
possibility that that you were deciding
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
why we had made that decision I also um
 
00:58:58.829 --> 00:58:58.839 align:start position:0%
noted that um you you refer to um uh who
 
00:59:00.589 --> 00:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
was in
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
charge um by political party as you will
 
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
know I have problems
 
00:59:11.309 --> 00:59:11.319 align:start position:0%
making um talking about Republicans and
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
Democrats as if we're diff different
 
00:59:16.109 --> 00:59:16.119 align:start position:0%
species if I remember
 
00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:19.640 align:start position:0%
correctly um the governor of the state
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
of n Hampshire at that point was in fact
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
a republican but perhaps I I I
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
my memory is wrong so that those are two
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
points that I want to make about your
 
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
opening statement the next point and
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
this won't surprise you I've often joked
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
about the fact that you can take a girl
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
out of Finance but you can't take
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
Finance out of the girl and you talked
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
about the uh the revenue that came in
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
before the change was made what you
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
didn't talk about is how much it cost
 
01:00:07.069 --> 01:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire to collect
 
01:00:11.029 --> 01:00:11.039 align:start position:0%
whatever it was they collected so even
 
01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:13.640 align:start position:0%
if one assumes that what they collected
 
01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.069 align:start position:0%
if one assumes that what they collected
was

01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate nonetheless it cost the
 
01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
state more to collect that
 
01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
money than um than the revenue that came
 
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
in um and that's something that I think
 
01:00:36.069 --> 01:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
again whether one is a Republican or a
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
Democrat um whatever
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
one's thoughts are on on fiscal policy
 
01:00:47.069 --> 01:00:47.079 align:start position:0%
no one would think it makes sense unless
 
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
you have uh you're interested in in
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
retribution it makes no sense for the
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
state to spend more
 
01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
to collect money then it's getting in
 
01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
return so on financial reasons um I
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
think it makes no sense to um uh to
 
01:01:16.029 --> 01:01:16.039 align:start position:0%
continue with this
 
01:01:22.589 --> 01:01:22.599 align:start position:0%
program um if in fact your Amendment um
 
01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
your Amendment and and uh
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh does not pass there is another
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
amendment which uh is prepared and it
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
was prepared um with the guidance of the
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner of administrative Services
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
as to how the department would like to
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
handle um what would be um a Financial
 
01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:53.240 align:start position:0%
Plus for the Department that in order to
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
make sure that given these uh difficult
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
times um with for whatever reason um our
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
not having quite enough money to do what
 
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
we want to do why it would make sense to
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
get rid of this effort to take the few
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
people who who are continuing to work in
 
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
this area and be able to put them in
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
different jobs that come closer to
 
01:02:26.029 --> 01:02:26.039 align:start position:0%
meeting the needs of the people of the
 
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
State and I would urge uh this committee
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
to vote down the amendment that has been
 
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
proposed so far to consider and I hope
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
accept the amendment that I would then
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
um present to the committee and to vote
 
01:02:52.029 --> 01:02:52.039 align:start position:0%
to support um this legislation which
 
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
makes sense from a financial point of
 
01:02:57.309 --> 01:02:57.319 align:start position:0%
view from a an administrative point of
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
view and if I dare say from a moral
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
point of view and
 
01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.950 align:start position:0%
point of view and
um

01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
uh I hope that we can come to an
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
agreement that way thank you anyone else
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
wish to be heard so I guess the last the
 
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:19.559 align:start position:0%
point I the point I would make here I I
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
I I think it I particularly want to
 
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
respond to representative bur's point
 
01:03:28.109 --> 01:03:28.119 align:start position:0%
because he he outlined all the you know
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
the how the the terrible situation of
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
the person in the circumstances that he
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
described but the problem is what about
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
what about you or me what about if we
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
are the per if it's our kid or you or me
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
that are the person in that circumstance
 
01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
do we get to say once they arrest the
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
real burglar later that oh oh you know I
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
had to hire an attorney it cost me
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
$10,000 $20,000 whatever I want my money
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
back who do I go to for that there is no
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
provision in the law that allows that so
 
01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:07.240 align:start position:0%
why is it for somebody and understand
 
01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
it's somebody who can afford to pay
 
01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
something why does somebody who can
 
01:04:15.549 --> 01:04:15.559 align:start position:0%
afford to pay
 
01:04:18.029 --> 01:04:18.039 align:start position:0%
something uh and and by the way under
 
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
this law does not change the fact that
 
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:21.400 align:start position:0%
the the the amount that can be collected
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
is is the is a a relatively small amount
 
01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
of the uh the it's capped by what the
 
01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:29.720 align:start position:0%
cost of a contract attorney would be uh
 
01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:31.799 align:start position:0%
which is a relatively small amount but
 
01:04:34.589 --> 01:04:34.599 align:start position:0%
why does a person who can afford to pay
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
that amount uh either all at once or
 
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
over time or whatever why do they get a
 
01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
pass on that when you or I who
 
01:04:45.069 --> 01:04:45.079 align:start position:0%
presumably would be charged much more in
 
01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
the private Market we don't get to get
 
01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%
our money back if we were found not
 
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
guilty um again I I go back to the issue
 
01:04:57.269 --> 01:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
that this is this is the sort of benign
 
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
discrimination of low expectations that
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
you know U it's just sort of um those
 
01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
those poor people or or people that are
 
01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:09.640 align:start position:0%
don't fit into sort of our class we
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
should just you know we we we just have
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
to sort of grit and bear it um we
 
01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't expect them to be uh to be to
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
be required to pay uh for their for for
 
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
what is otherwise their responsibility
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
it's the same I I have have to say on a
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
broader perspective it's the same thing
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
in so many areas that where where
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
there's a f I think a fundamental
 
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
philosophical disagreement you know do
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
why I I would say why should people um
 
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh you know for example young young
 
01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
un unmarried without children men or
 
01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
women who who are capable of working why
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
should they be eligible to get Medicaid
 
01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:54.839 align:start position:0%
or not have to pay for it but some
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
people say oh no no it'll be it'll it'll
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
be too much of a hassle to require them
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
to to do it that kind of thing do the
 
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
question it seems to me is how much do
 
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
we want to
 
01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
socialize um the provision of services
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
and I say in this area we should not do
 
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair Mr Mr chair yeah
 
01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.870 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair Mr Mr chair yeah
representative

01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.829 align:start position:0%
representative
bur

01:06:18.829 --> 01:06:18.839 align:start position:0%
bur
 
01:06:22.109 --> 01:06:22.119 align:start position:0%
I I think there are distinctions that
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
that need to be made uh when you or I
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
choose to hire an
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
attorney that's a choice we make that's
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh we can negotiate the price we can uh
 
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
have uh an uncle do it for us whatever
 
01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:41.799 align:start position:0%
it is we're talking here about children
 
01:06:44.589 --> 01:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
and and indigen adults who have a
 
01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:47.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional right and what we're
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
talking about is making children and
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
adults pay for a constitutional right
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about that in the
 
01:06:58.349 --> 01:06:58.359 align:start position:0%
context of adults at all mean you mean
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
mean I don't have if if I can afford to
 
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
pay for a lawyer I don't have a
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to have a lawyer
 
01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
you have a constitutional right to have
 
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
a lawyer but there's no requirement that
 
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
a lawyer be
 
01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:11.559 align:start position:0%
assigned okay the state does not have to
 
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
to do that and your general argument
 
01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I think there probably is a
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
philosophic uh distinction I'm reminded
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
of Was A Tale of Two Cities or whatever
 
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
that uh that makes it clear that the
 
01:07:27.069 --> 01:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
rich and the poor have the right to
 
01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:31.640 align:start position:0%
sleep under bridges um equally and that
 
01:07:35.549 --> 01:07:35.559 align:start position:0%
may be true but I'm not sure how that
 
01:07:38.589 --> 01:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
addresses the issue of we're talking
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
about people with no money who are
 
01:07:46.029 --> 01:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
dragged into a system for no bad acts of
 
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
their own and whether we feel right as a
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
society that the state wants their money
 
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
that we have Det determined already that
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
they do not have so I think it's you're
 
01:08:03.309 --> 01:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
you're comparing apples and oranges
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
representative Smith um thank you um um
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair you are entitled to your
 
01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
opinion as each of us is entitled to our
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
opinion but none of us is
 
01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
entitled to make up our own facts and I
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
would ask you if you could uh to support
 
01:08:33.789 --> 01:08:33.799 align:start position:0%
your argument of bringing Medicaid in to
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
the issue if you could tell us in fact
 
01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
who receives Medicaid in this state what
 
01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
the age is of those people who receive
 
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid what the um eligibility is of
 
01:08:53.149 --> 01:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
those people who receive Medicaid and I
 
01:08:56.110 --> 01:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
believe that the facts will show that
 
01:09:01.709 --> 01:09:01.719 align:start position:0%
we're not talking here about able bodied
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
adults who are um just choosing to sit
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
at home and read romance novels and eat
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
Bon bonss and receive Medicaid that's
 
01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
not who's receiving Medicaid so your
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
opinion I have no problem with but the
 
01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
facts I do thank you well again I'm
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
sorry representative
 
01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
Oregon I just want to point out the
 
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal note indicates that uh we're the
 
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
$754,000 to collect
 
01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
$640,000 and 416 so it seems me we're
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
keeping the OCC we're losing the OCC is
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
losing money like um so I think this is
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
a uh not a good business proposition
 
01:09:52.829 --> 01:09:52.839 align:start position:0%
keeping this um keeping this keeping
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
this open so it's not worth spending
 
01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:55.870 align:start position:0%
this open so it's not worth spending
750,000

01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
750,000
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
to collect six you know we're better off
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
we can save $110,000 by just eliminating
 
01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
the office so I think the OCC should go
 
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
the way of the penny and the nickel so
 
01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
we should it's time to get rid of it so
 
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
thanks other any other comments seeing
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
none are we ready for oh I'm sorry
 
01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:13.719 align:start position:0%
representative mcfar thank you Mr
 
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I may Mr Speaker I would just
 
01:10:18.669 --> 01:10:18.679 align:start position:0%
inquire of Representative Burch even if
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
I were inclined to agree with any of the
 
01:10:23.709 --> 01:10:23.719 align:start position:0%
arguments that he set
 
01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
forward why then
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
would I think that it is more or less
 
01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
unfair for that Indigent defendant who
 
01:10:37.229 --> 01:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
is not convicted than the one who was
 
01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
convicted what you're essentially
 
01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
suggesting it seems to me is that not
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
only are you as representative Lynn set
 
01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
you talks about setting uh the the the
 
01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
rights of the Indigent defendants aside
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
from the rights of everyone else but you
 
01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
are suggesting that this should now be
 
01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking uh I tried in this
 
01:11:06.189 --> 01:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
portion of the discussion to talk about
 
01:11:06.199 --> 01:11:06.950 align:start position:0%
portion of the discussion to talk about
the

01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
amendment and the amend a core part of
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment is to remove the
 
01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
distinction between adding the uh the
 
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
requirement to pay for non-convicted
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
people so I try to address that I am in
 
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:27.640 align:start position:0%
favor of the overall Bill I'm a
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor and the uh amendment by
 
01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
representative Smith that ends the
 
01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
practice whether uh the person was
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
guilty or not uh mostly for the point of
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
view that uh in The Frugal state of our
 
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
economy uh spending and and this I
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
practiced in Vermont Vermont came to
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
this conclusion 20 years ago that it
 
01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
made no sense to spend more money trying
 
01:11:59.470 --> 01:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
to collect than you collect and that's
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
just a simple uh you know uh concept of
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
good government and but my argument here
 
01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
was really basically on the amendment
 
01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
itself thank you all right anyone else
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
all right I think then we're ready for
 
01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh and I given the given the the state
 
01:12:18.910 --> 01:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
of the debate I think I'm would make
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
sense to have a roll call vote on the
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
amendment so we're voting on um
 
01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:27.080 align:start position:0%

amendment to my Amendment um for those
 
01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
of us who were um present when the bill
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
was heard um by the committee uh there
 
01:16:17.229 --> 01:16:17.239 align:start position:0%
was a a discussion and during that
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
discussion the commissioner of
 
01:16:18.719 --> 01:16:20.070 align:start position:0%
discussion the commissioner of
administrative

01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
Services um
 
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh raised some issues and asked that the
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
committee consider um accepting
 
01:16:37.149 --> 01:16:37.159 align:start position:0%
uh certain
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
um procedures that would be necessary to
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
make um what was the original bill um
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
come to fruition in the most um
 
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
effective and responsible way and on the
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
basis of that an amendment was prepared
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
0611 it is a uh totally a convenient uh
 
01:17:11.629 --> 01:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
that the um amendment number is actually
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
the same as the bill number which I
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
think shows that somewhere in The Ether
 
01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
this was a a good match and um that um
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
can't blame me for
 
01:17:28.990 --> 01:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
digging deep on this and
 
01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
um uh and all that this does is make an
 
01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
efficient smooth operation for the
 
01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
and um if you were to accept this
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
amendment I believe what would happen is
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
it would um as
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
the Second Amendment
 
01:17:57.629 --> 01:17:57.639 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment is another good term
 
01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
here as a second amendment it would um
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
replace in this case the First Amendment
 
01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:07.310 align:start position:0%
replace in this case the First Amendment
but

01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
only um in a limited way and it would
 
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
mean that we would then vote on this
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
and then vote on um the bill as
 
01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
amended by 611
 
01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard on the
 
01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
amendment by representative Smith so I
 
01:18:31.390 --> 01:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
guess what I would just say basically is
 
01:18:33.790 --> 01:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
I mean I think it's obvious that this
 
01:18:35.790 --> 01:18:35.800 align:start position:0%
this amendment was designed to go along
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
with the with the original Bill we've
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
now replaced the bill with the amendment
 
01:18:42.990 --> 01:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
we've just voted on so I would urge uh
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
the body to reject this amendment um so
 
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
that we can then proceed to the main
 
01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
Bill to a vote on the main bill with the
 
01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
amendment we've already approved um
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard all right
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%

01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:28.639 align:start position:0%
a step or two ahead of ourselves here
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
but like assuming the full house uh goes
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
with the um op to pass with your
 
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment um would this would this more
 
01:22:38.629 --> 01:22:38.639 align:start position:0%
likely go to a money committee and if so
 
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
would it be Finance or ways and means I
 
01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
I I mean my I think let me just make
 
01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
sure this but I think this is an early
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
Bill I'm almost positive it is and so I
 
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
think it will go to finance yes um hang
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
on let me make
 
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
sure yeah well that just because it has
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
an FN doesn't mean that but let me just
 
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
on yeah 611 is an early bill so we we'll
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
go to finance okay thanks all right all
 
01:23:17.070 --> 01:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
right um Mr chair if I could just um
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
thank the commissioner of the Department
 
01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
of administrative services and the
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
deputy for taking time of their busy
 
01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
schedule to be here um and to um observe
 
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
um obviously I'm not going to ask them
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
to speak to what we've done because they
 
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
certainly would not likely say anything
 
01:23:44.189 --> 01:23:44.199 align:start position:0%
but um uh I do appreciate the fact that
 
01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
they were here and um assume that they
 
01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
will be there when Finance decides what
 
01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
to do with the Department's budget
 
01:23:58.350 --> 01:23:58.360 align:start position:0%
right right yes thank you thank you for
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
being here all right um next um I would
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh like to turn to um HB um
 
01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to recognize oh I'm sorry
 
01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:56.590 --> 01:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
done I'm going going to um again
 
01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:00.639 align:start position:0%
recognize um myself and I would
 
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
move um otpa on uh House Bill 615 FN
 
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
with Amendment 2025
 
01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.590 align:start position:0%
with Amendment 2025
0320

01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
0320
 
01:25:17.550 --> 01:25:17.560 align:start position:0%
um H
 
01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
um and I'd ask is there a
 
01:25:21.159 --> 01:25:23.310 align:start position:0%
um and I'd ask is there a
second

01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
second all right so it's
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
um moved by uh representative Lyn
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Perez and if
 
01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
I could uh speak to the amendment first
 
01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:39.830 align:start position:0%
I could uh speak to the amendment first
um

01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
um the the amendment basically makes for
 
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
lack of a better term uh sort of
 
01:25:49.950 --> 01:25:49.960 align:start position:0%
technical changes to the language um
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
that um that
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
make basically clarify the the terms of
 
01:25:58.189 --> 01:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
the original um of the original bill I
 
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
don't really um for example um there's a
 
01:26:04.629 --> 01:26:04.639 align:start position:0%
there's a uh a more clear
 
01:26:09.149 --> 01:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
reference um in uh to uh the
 
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which um an innoc in
 
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
which an innocent owner would not have
 
01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
property forfeited um the the amendment
 
01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
clarifies that language to some extent
 
01:26:26.109 --> 01:26:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
um and let me just think of it what
 
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh there's also a provision that makes
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
it clear that if a that if a person um
 
01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
is if a person has an interest in
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
property that is subject to seizure or
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
to forfeiture but is not the defendant
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
it the the amendment makes it clear that
 
01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
that per if that person loses in the
 
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
trial court the person can take an
 
01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
appeal um to a higher Court in
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
accordance with with the with uh the
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
state uh in accordance with the rules of
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
the court or the state state rules uh uh
 
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
State statutes that may deal with
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
appeals in civil cases so um I think the
 
01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:10.280 align:start position:0%
amendment um is not
 
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
particularly um substantive it Mo it
 
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
mostly clarifies and makes uh more
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
understandable language in the original
 
01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:21.719 align:start position:0%
bill um so that's I would support uh the
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Mana
 
01:27:23.679 --> 01:27:24.990 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Mana
representative

01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:26.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I don't have a copy
 
01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
of the amendment and I'm wondering if
 
01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
you have a copy that you could pass
 
01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:39.760 align:start position:0%

01:27:42.430 --> 01:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
um uh I I'm sorry I guess I thought
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
everybody did have copies long a long
 
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
time ago Mr chair it was it was handed
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%
to the committee during the public
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
hearing okay um so um
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
I mean does everybody does everybody
 
01:27:59.149 --> 01:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the amendment should I
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
think everybody I I mean I'm happy to
 
01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
give you my copy representative Manos
 
01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
but I think everybody um okay all right
 
01:28:10.189 --> 01:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
so anybody else wish to be heard on the
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
amendment yes representative bur thank
 
01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
you and my comment is really a question
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
to you um in order for a property to be
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
um forfeited
 
01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:27.470 align:start position:0%
um forfeited
uh

01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
the person has to have not have actual
 
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
knowledge and I want to get to why the
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
requirement of actual knowledge is in so
 
01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
much of the law we use constructive
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge or had reason to believe but
 
01:28:47.470 --> 01:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
here it's actual knowledge so if
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
somebody bars my car with a wink and a
 
01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:53.639 align:start position:0%
nod and says I'm going to get some ice
 
01:28:53.639 --> 01:28:54.750 align:start position:0%
nod and says I'm going to get some ice
cream

01:28:54.750 --> 01:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
cream
 
01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
and you kind of know dog on well they're
 
01:28:59.629 --> 01:28:59.639 align:start position:0%
not going to get some ice cream but
 
01:29:01.310 --> 01:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
you're all allly in free for getting
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
your car back unless you can act prove
 
01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
that I actually knew exactly what they
 
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
were going to do I'm just wondering why
 
01:29:11.709 --> 01:29:11.719 align:start position:0%
that standard yeah so you know I guess
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
what I would say is this I think I'm not
 
01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
sure that in the wink and the nod
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
situation that wouldn't amount to act
 
01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
you know there is this uh the this idea
 
01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
in the law of willful blindness that if
 
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
you if you if you really do know but you
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
try to sort of You Know cover your face
 
01:29:31.709 --> 01:29:31.719 align:start position:0%
that that's that that is not that that
 
01:29:34.990 --> 01:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
would not undercut there being actual
 
01:29:38.189 --> 01:29:38.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge but the broader issue is I
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
think the whole idea of this
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
bill was
 
01:29:47.709 --> 01:29:47.719 align:start position:0%
to make forfeiture
 
01:29:47.719 --> 01:29:50.070 align:start position:0%
to make forfeiture
proceedings

01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
um more for lack of a better term more
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
owners for the state to to sustain
 
01:29:57.470 --> 01:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
forfeitures it was designed to be a sort
 
01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
of defendant and uh property owner
 
01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
friendly bill to make the law more you
 
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
know more hospitable uh to um to people
 
01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
whose property is subject to forfeiture
 
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
and I think it's in that spirit that
 
01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
that language was included um there you
 
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
know for example
 
01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
um in under a current forfeiture law
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
there is a provision that says if your
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
if your let's say your car is used to
 
01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.390 align:start position:0%
if your let's say your car is used to
deliver

01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:33.400 align:start position:0%
deliver
 
01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
drugs um you some somebody who's the
 
01:30:39.149 --> 01:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
defendant in the case uses your car to
 
01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:43.239 align:start position:0%
deliver drugs you claim and then and
 
01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
then the the police for uh sees the car
 
01:30:49.629 --> 01:30:49.639 align:start position:0%
and they propose to Forfeit it you
 
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
claim I I didn't know I didn't know you
 
01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
know I I didn't know that uh
 
01:30:58.390 --> 01:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh my friend John Smith who was who
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
delivered the drugs was going to use it
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
to deliver drugs under our current
 
01:31:05.629 --> 01:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
forfeit your law you bear the burden of
 
01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
establishing that you are an innocent
 
01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
that you that in fact you didn't know
 
01:31:14.669 --> 01:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
this this bill changes that it's the
 
01:31:16.750 --> 01:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
state that bears the burden it it
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
eliminates that um that uh provision
 
01:31:23.470 --> 01:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
that shifts the burden um I mean that's
 
01:31:26.669 --> 01:31:26.679 align:start position:0%
just that's one example um but there are
 
01:31:29.390 --> 01:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
a number of other things it has
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
Provisions that allow um that say for uh
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
forfeiture can't be allowed for uh
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
currency totaling $1,000 or less or
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles of value of $5,000 or
 
01:31:47.629 --> 01:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
less um
 
01:31:51.310 --> 01:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
um basically to sort of and again I
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
assume that part of the issue there that
 
01:31:56.990 --> 01:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
that that what we're getting at there is
 
01:31:59.310 --> 01:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
if they're if if somebody's going to be
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
charged with a crime and they're going
 
01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
to and they're going to be facing um the
 
01:32:05.709 --> 01:32:05.719 align:start position:0%
penalties of of the drug offenses which
 
01:32:08.910 --> 01:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
can themselves be particularly serious
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
that if it's a relatively small amount
 
01:32:16.590 --> 01:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
of uh property or uh or money that um
 
01:32:18.189 --> 01:32:18.199 align:start position:0%
that the state shouldn't be allowed to
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
proceed with the forfeiture so those are
 
01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
those are the U those are the basic
 
01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:25.030 align:start position:0%
those are the U those are the basic
ideas

01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
ideas
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
one one further question if I may sure
 
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
the following sentence says the states
 
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
Sam summarily shall return property to
 
01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:36.430 align:start position:0%
Sam summarily shall return property to
such

01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
such
 
01:32:38.910 --> 01:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
person I I think if I understand the
 
01:32:42.030 --> 01:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
overall bill that's not so
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily because that property may
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
need to be used in a parallel criminal
 
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
prosecution and the like but I'm
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about that language which
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
seems which is both mandatory and
 
01:33:01.470 --> 01:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem subject to uh uh other uses
 
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
the state might have in a criminal case
 
01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
for hanging on to that property well I
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
think there is I'm sorry in other places
 
01:33:12.510 --> 01:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
I think that's covered but I'm just
 
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
wondering why the sentence is in there
 
01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
because it now you're going to build
 
01:33:20.590 --> 01:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
it's got two different ways uh if I'm an
 
01:33:22.149 --> 01:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
innocent owner I'm going to say hey I
 
01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
want my property back now I don't care
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
about your criminal prosecution says
 
01:33:29.310 --> 01:33:29.320 align:start position:0%
State sarily shall return the property
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
right right but I I mean I think that
 
01:33:33.310 --> 01:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
that's that that the state shall
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
summarily return the property if there's
 
01:33:38.109 --> 01:33:38.119 align:start position:0%
if there's no if if it in fact is
 
01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
established that you're an innocent
 
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
owner if there's a question about
 
01:33:43.229 --> 01:33:43.239 align:start position:0%
whether you really are then that's then
 
01:33:44.910 --> 01:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
you know no even if you are an innocent
 
01:33:47.790 --> 01:33:47.800 align:start position:0%
owner right the state may need that car
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
or whatever that's been seized for his
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
criminal case oh but you know what
 
01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:53.560 align:start position:0%
there's other Provisions in the bill
 
01:33:55.590 --> 01:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
that say you can take you can like you
 
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
know right so then it's not sarily I'm
 
01:33:59.629 --> 01:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
just worried about the language here
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
which Brooks no
 
01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
exception I understand other parts of
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
the bill allow the
 
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
exception I guess I would say I think
 
01:34:10.709 --> 01:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
that that language would I think that
 
01:34:13.390 --> 01:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
the that that can be read consistently
 
01:34:17.109 --> 01:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
with the other language thank you um all
 
01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
right um other um other
 
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
questions um on I guess we're talking
 
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
about the amendment only right now
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else have any questions on the
 
01:34:31.109 --> 01:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
amendment so um seeing none I would ask
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%

second all right
 
01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
um I really I I really have I don't
 
01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
think I have much else to say um than
 
01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
what I said before basically this bill
 
01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
is designed
 
01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
to for lack of a better term sort of
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
take the the um the edge off forfeitures
 
01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
to make it somewhat less honorous than
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
it is under current law
 
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
to allow for certain exceptions for
 
01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
small amounts of uh of uh of money or
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
property um to uh and oh and the other
 
01:37:05.229 --> 01:37:05.239 align:start position:0%
thing the other thing that this bill
 
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
does it's it really importantly is it
 
01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
says that
 
01:37:12.510 --> 01:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
although the the forfeiture proceeding
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
is a separate proceeding from the
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
criminal case it's a separate civil
 
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
proceeding it will be handled by the
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
same judge that handles the criminal
 
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
proceeding um and that the public
 
01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:24.430 align:start position:0%
proceeding um and that the public
defender

01:37:24.430 --> 01:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
defender
 
01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
um will represent the person in the
 
01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
forfeiture will represent the defendant
 
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
not not some third party who might be
 
01:37:33.070 --> 01:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
claiming Innocent but we represent the
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
defendant in the proceeding so it's
 
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
basically designed as I said before to
 
01:37:42.750 --> 01:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
to uh make forfeiture proceedings
 
01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:46.159 align:start position:0%
somewhat less onerous um somewhat more
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
favorable to either the defendant or a
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
person whose property is being subject
 
01:37:54.910 --> 01:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
to forfeiture I think it makes sense to
 
01:37:58.350 --> 01:37:58.360 align:start position:0%
do that um and that's why I support it
 
01:38:01.390 --> 01:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
um anyone else wish to be
 
01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:03.679 align:start position:0%
heard all right seeing none I'd ask the
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
clerk then to call the
 
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:09.480 align:start position:0%

01:57:51.950 --> 01:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely I have two con two problems
 
01:57:55.870 --> 01:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
with with the bill small and
 
01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
large the bill itself has two the cacr
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
itself has two
 
01:58:05.790 --> 01:58:05.800 align:start position:0%
sentences one the right to freely use
 
01:58:09.229 --> 01:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
Etc shall not be infringed which seems
 
01:58:11.189 --> 01:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
to be an
 
01:58:15.310 --> 01:58:15.320 align:start position:0%
absolute but then the second sentence
 
01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
says you can infringe under law laws and
 
01:58:23.550 --> 01:58:23.560 align:start position:0%
regulations if they are considered
 
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable whatever that word means so
 
01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
we have a first sentence that is not
 
01:58:32.589 --> 01:58:32.599 align:start position:0%
consistent with a second sentence let's
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
put that aside a
 
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
bit my concern about the cacr is the
 
01:58:43.189 --> 01:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
potential misuse of the
 
01:58:47.470 --> 01:58:47.480 align:start position:0%
cacr by people who commit crimes serious
 
01:58:50.109 --> 01:58:50.119 align:start position:0%
crimes through the use of
 
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
computers so we could talk about if we
 
01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:56.030 align:start position:0%
computers so we could talk about if we
like

01:58:56.030 --> 01:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:58:59.950 --> 01:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
pedophiles who commit horrible crimes
 
01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:01.109 align:start position:0%
pedophiles who commit horrible crimes
against

01:59:01.109 --> 01:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
children by use of
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
computers but according to this
 
01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
cacr their right to use that computer
 
01:59:13.229 --> 01:59:13.239 align:start position:0%
shall not be
 
01:59:13.239 --> 01:59:14.830 align:start position:0%
shall not be
infringed

01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
infringed
 
01:59:19.589 --> 01:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
so you get somebody arrested for let's
 
01:59:22.669 --> 01:59:22.679 align:start position:0%
say Interstate crime against children we
 
01:59:24.550 --> 01:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
have a whole division in the state that
 
01:59:27.589 --> 01:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
deals with that that person is arrested
 
01:59:31.950 --> 01:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for using a computer
 
01:59:36.030 --> 01:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
to uh improperly associate with
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
children and they're
 
01:59:44.189 --> 01:59:44.199 align:start position:0%
charged the judge normally now would
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
restrict as a bail condition that
 
01:59:48.430 --> 01:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
person's use of a
 
01:59:51.870 --> 01:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
computer now a judge under this cacr if
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
pay P presumably would not be able to do
 
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
so and that's not a good thing my mind
 
02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
secondly we talk about we had a fairly
 
02:00:07.910 --> 02:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
famous person in Keen who did romance
 
02:00:10.950 --> 02:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
scams to tune of millions of dollars
 
02:00:14.270 --> 02:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
using computers Bitcoins and the like uh
 
02:00:17.069 --> 02:00:17.079 align:start position:0%
he's now sitting in federal
 
02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
prison now I am sure as a condition of
 
02:00:22.069 --> 02:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
his sentence
 
02:00:26.350 --> 02:00:26.360 align:start position:0%
that he is barred for uses certain usage
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
of a computer during his prison sentence
 
02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:30.189 align:start position:0%
of a computer during his prison sentence
I

02:00:30.189 --> 02:00:30.199 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:00:32.990 --> 02:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
would think if he were incarcerated in
 
02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.069 align:start position:0%
would think if he were incarcerated in
New

02:00:34.069 --> 02:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
New
 
02:00:36.830 --> 02:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at the right of individuals to
 
02:00:40.669 --> 02:00:40.679 align:start position:0%
freely use computational resources would
 
02:00:43.229 --> 02:00:43.239 align:start position:0%
allow him to continue doing
 
02:00:47.229 --> 02:00:47.239 align:start position:0%
whatever scams and the like that he
 
02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
would want to
 
02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
do so I think I would have a hard time
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
explaining my to my
 
02:00:58.830 --> 02:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
constituents why I would like New
 
02:01:03.390 --> 02:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be a place where all the
 
02:01:05.550 --> 02:01:05.560 align:start position:0%
pedophiles can feel
 
02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable coming here and applying
 
02:01:13.310 --> 02:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
their business or why people who have
 
02:01:16.990 --> 02:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
been let's say convicted in other states
 
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
and barred from certain uses of
 
02:01:21.990 --> 02:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
computers can feel comfortable moving to
 
02:01:25.830 --> 02:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and um continuing to do
 
02:01:27.910 --> 02:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
whatever got them barred from using
 
02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
computers in other states so while I
 
02:01:34.589 --> 02:01:34.599 align:start position:0%
like the general idea I think this
 
02:01:37.229 --> 02:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment is not ready
 
02:01:40.069 --> 02:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
for Prime Time Mr Speaker may I respond
 
02:01:41.950 --> 02:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
to those points yeah let me just ask
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to be heard all right
 
02:01:45.550 --> 02:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
no representative McFarland go ahead
 
02:01:49.830 --> 02:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so Mr Speaker first of all to
 
02:01:52.270 --> 02:01:52.280 align:start position:0%
representative bur's point about the
 
02:01:54.589 --> 02:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
language of the proposed Constitutional
 
02:01:54.599 --> 02:01:56.310 align:start position:0%
language of the proposed Constitutional
Amendment

02:01:56.310 --> 02:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
itself uh I don't think that the
 
02:02:02.189 --> 02:02:02.199 align:start position:0%
language is perfect uh for example I am
 
02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
not a fan of split infinitives and I
 
02:02:05.830 --> 02:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
would quite like to amend it so that
 
02:02:08.109 --> 02:02:08.119 align:start position:0%
instead of saying to freely access it
 
02:02:10.589 --> 02:02:10.599 align:start position:0%
says freely to access however I think it
 
02:02:12.629 --> 02:02:12.639 align:start position:0%
is good enough for the purpose and and
 
02:02:14.950 --> 02:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
you make the point um or representative
 
02:02:17.189 --> 02:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
Birch rather makes the point that the
 
02:02:20.310 --> 02:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
second sentence in his view uh is in
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
conflict with the first and I I suggest
 
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
to the committee that that is not the
 
02:02:26.669 --> 02:02:26.679 align:start position:0%
case the first sentence is a broad
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
statement as to the right and the second
 
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
statement is a slightly narrower
 
02:02:34.350 --> 02:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
statement which in no way conflicts with
 
02:02:36.550 --> 02:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
the first it does not say that it would
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
be appropriate to burden that right it
 
02:02:43.790 --> 02:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
merely makes it abundantly clear that
 
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
one of the effects of this
 
02:02:48.750 --> 02:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment should be that
 
02:02:50.910 --> 02:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
there would be no law or regulation that
 
02:02:54.350 --> 02:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
unreasonably burdens the right if I make
 
02:02:56.910 --> 02:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
comparison to the Second Amendment I
 
02:03:00.750 --> 02:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
have not heard any of the most strong
 
02:03:03.669 --> 02:03:03.679 align:start position:0%
and Ardent Second Amendment supporters
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
suggest that it is appropriate that
 
02:03:09.149 --> 02:03:09.159 align:start position:0%
incarcerated prisoners should be allowed
 
02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
to roam the jails and roam the prisons
 
02:03:13.709 --> 02:03:13.719 align:start position:0%
with loaded
 
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
AK-47s so I I think if we're going to be
 
02:03:19.510 --> 02:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
serious about this and if you want me to
 
02:03:22.669 --> 02:03:22.679 align:start position:0%
come to your second point about this you
 
02:03:25.589 --> 02:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
know supposed parade of of pedophiles
 
02:03:27.669 --> 02:03:27.679 align:start position:0%
that are going to come to the state we
 
02:03:28.990 --> 02:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
02:03:32.470 --> 02:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
realistic that reasonable restrictions
 
02:03:34.870 --> 02:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
exist upon other constitutionally
 
02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
protected freedoms and that this one
 
02:03:39.109 --> 02:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
ultimately should be no different what
 
02:03:42.109 --> 02:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
we have however seen both in this state
 
02:03:46.950 --> 02:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
and in this nation is not merely as uh
 
02:03:50.669 --> 02:03:50.679 align:start position:0%
the B sponsor talked about uh actions by
 
02:03:53.229 --> 02:03:53.239 align:start position:0%
for example the Biden Administration
 
02:03:57.430 --> 02:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
against uh people who would potentially
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
have a large amount of compute for AI
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
purposes or be doing it in a way that is
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
not considered sufficiently green but we
 
02:04:07.549 --> 02:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
have seen a history of other uh attempts
 
02:04:10.669 --> 02:04:10.679 align:start position:0%
to to block and thwart uh the free use
 
02:04:12.549 --> 02:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
of computers and and the free use of
 
02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
secure encryption so for those reasons I
 
02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
would urge the committee to support the
 
02:04:20.189 --> 02:04:20.199 align:start position:0%
bill right anyone else wish to be
 
02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
heard I'm sorry represent Oran do you
 
02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
want to speak oh yes I do yes um first
 
02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
of all I'm glad uh the member from
 
02:04:29.549 --> 02:04:29.559 align:start position:0%
Orange brought up the Second Amendment
 
02:04:32.430 --> 02:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
because that language I think is
 
02:04:34.669 --> 02:04:34.679 align:start position:0%
problematic so it's been misin
 
02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
interpreted not so much by the uh courts
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
but by like you know by you know
 
02:04:41.149 --> 02:04:41.159 align:start position:0%
individuals a political spear like us to
 
02:04:43.149 --> 02:04:43.159 align:start position:0%
being that like I guess there maybe
 
02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
unless you're a prisoner incarcerated
 
02:04:46.390 --> 02:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
you some people think the Second
 
02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment says you're supposed to be
 
02:04:49.950 --> 02:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
able to have a gun anywhere for any
 
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
purpose and as somebody uses
 
02:04:54.709 --> 02:04:54.719 align:start position:0%
computers a lot of time that would be
 
02:04:56.229 --> 02:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
kind of cool if I could use my computer
 
02:04:58.510 --> 02:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
anyway I wanted anyway you know for any
 
02:05:01.069 --> 02:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
purpose you know like uh and somebody
 
02:05:02.470 --> 02:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't like when I'm doing computer you
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
know they can just go stuff it so that
 
02:05:06.310 --> 02:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
kind of appealing but still the language
 
02:05:08.790 --> 02:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
I think is problematic um he mentioned
 
02:05:10.549 --> 02:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
the Biden Administration who of course
 
02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
are no longer in power and uh Supply
 
02:05:14.990 --> 02:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
certain us of AI are insufficiently
 
02:05:17.189 --> 02:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
green um that's that's a pretty
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern aside from just
 
02:05:22.430 --> 02:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
certain ai ai Technologies or
 
02:05:25.149 --> 02:05:25.159 align:start position:0%
the problematic in terms of uh how they
 
02:05:27.950 --> 02:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
use copyrighted uh intellectual property
 
02:05:29.790 --> 02:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
but also like just in terms of energy
 
02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
consumption we've had problems with
 
02:05:33.189 --> 02:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin and other Technologies even
 
02:05:35.189 --> 02:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
though they're very interesting in doing
 
02:05:37.270 --> 02:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
groovy sometimes they do waste use a
 
02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
huge amounts of power I think the
 
02:05:40.709 --> 02:05:40.719 align:start position:0%
government does have an interest in you
 
02:05:43.629 --> 02:05:43.639 align:start position:0%
know conserving uh you know conserving
 
02:05:45.030 --> 02:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
energy at least at some point the
 
02:05:46.629 --> 02:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
government will think it has an interest
 
02:05:48.910 --> 02:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
in it and U so I understand uh they
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
echoing the Second Amendment it is part
 
02:05:52.149 --> 02:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
of our constitution in fact it's about
 
02:05:54.030 --> 02:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
the only part of my con Constitution and
 
02:05:54.040 --> 02:05:54.830 align:start position:0%
the only part of my con Constitution and
I'm

02:05:54.830 --> 02:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
sure that we haven't tried to redefine
 
02:05:58.990 --> 02:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
or you know there haven't been any
 
02:06:00.629 --> 02:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
executive orders related to trying to
 
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
like redefine what the Second Amendment
 
02:06:04.109 --> 02:06:04.119 align:start position:0%
means so maybe it's the only part of the
 
02:06:05.910 --> 02:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
constitu Federal Constitution that's
 
02:06:08.069 --> 02:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
left but I still think that's
 
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know I still think this is just
 
02:06:12.189 --> 02:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
something it shouldn't be in the I'm not
 
02:06:13.629 --> 02:06:13.639 align:start position:0%
sure this is as written as a good
 
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
addition to the State Constitution and
 
02:06:19.510 --> 02:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
um also we can't the people can't vote
 
02:06:22.069 --> 02:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
on this until November 202 six so
 
02:06:24.189 --> 02:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
there's no rush we have
 
02:06:26.830 --> 02:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh we have plenty I mean we have lots of
 
02:06:28.390 --> 02:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
other things to do but we have plenty of
 
02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
time to retain this bill if and uh try
 
02:06:33.669 --> 02:06:33.679 align:start position:0%
to come up with more acceptable language
 
02:06:35.629 --> 02:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
although I'm
 
02:06:37.870 --> 02:06:37.880 align:start position:0%
personally even if you reord this I
 
02:06:38.990 --> 02:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
don't think there something who needs to
 
02:06:40.589 --> 02:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
be in the State Constitution and
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
certainly I certainly was sympathetic by
 
02:06:44.470 --> 02:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
the way to what the bid administration's
 
02:06:46.750 --> 02:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about AI not being green
 
02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
enough even though um you know it's very
 
02:06:51.430 --> 02:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
interesting even though some ways a lot
 
02:06:53.109 --> 02:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
of that technology very interesting but
 
02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
I'm uh we seem to be getting a little
 
02:06:56.669 --> 02:06:56.679 align:start position:0%
bit off the topic well I'm just
 
02:06:58.229 --> 02:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
responding to what he said but I just I
 
02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
think the main thing is uh I think
 
02:07:02.830 --> 02:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
everybody seems to agree that there's
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
problems with the language nobody's
 
02:07:06.750 --> 02:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
really enthusiastic about putting the
 
02:07:08.589 --> 02:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
state constitutions I don't think if the
 
02:07:11.030 --> 02:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
point is to do something about this uh
 
02:07:13.870 --> 02:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
we we can probably think about this some
 
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
more and uh you know consider it bring
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
something to the floor next year we
 
02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
don't have to do it this year since
 
02:07:21.119 --> 02:07:22.470 align:start position:0%
don't have to do it this year since
nobody

02:07:22.470 --> 02:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
nobody
 
02:07:25.030 --> 02:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
we can't the people can't vote on it
 
02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
until next year anyway there's no hurry
 
02:07:29.229 --> 02:07:29.239 align:start position:0%
so all right anyone else wish should be
 
02:07:31.390 --> 02:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
heard uh representative tur and then
 
02:07:35.589 --> 02:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
representative bur yeah thank thank you
 
02:07:38.030 --> 02:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I
 
02:07:39.910 --> 02:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
think being that this is a
 
02:07:43.149 --> 02:07:43.159 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment proposition it
 
02:07:45.629 --> 02:07:45.639 align:start position:0%
raises to a different level sort of the
 
02:07:48.990 --> 02:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
degree to which we have to focus on what
 
02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:49.790 align:start position:0%
degree to which we have to focus on what
the

02:07:49.790 --> 02:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
underlying threat that were basically
 
02:07:55.149 --> 02:07:55.159 align:start position:0%
worried about to our rights is and
 
02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
listening to the bill
 
02:07:59.870 --> 02:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor you referred to you know
 
02:08:02.310 --> 02:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
essentially a federal requirement to
 
02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
register certain
 
02:08:08.510 --> 02:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
services to my understanding that that
 
02:08:10.990 --> 02:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
does not require or allow any sort of
 
02:08:13.109 --> 02:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
restriction about it it's just a
 
02:08:16.229 --> 02:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
registration process and we didn't
 
02:08:19.629 --> 02:08:19.639 align:start position:0%
really hear any examples in the hearing
 
02:08:21.950 --> 02:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
of anyone's ability
 
02:08:25.629 --> 02:08:25.639 align:start position:0%
to use comp computational Services being
 
02:08:27.950 --> 02:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
being spelled out in any sort of
 
02:08:31.189 --> 02:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
functional way it feels like the minimum
 
02:08:32.830 --> 02:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
bar before we start putting a
 
02:08:34.910 --> 02:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment before the
 
02:08:36.709 --> 02:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state would be to
 
02:08:36.719 --> 02:08:37.830 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state would be to
basically

02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:08:41.950 --> 02:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
establish a real threat um and then you
 
02:08:45.629 --> 02:08:45.639 align:start position:0%
know if we get past that hurdle the
 
02:08:48.189 --> 02:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
language here to me seems fairly wide
 
02:08:50.310 --> 02:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
open and undefined there's no guard
 
02:08:52.709 --> 02:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
rails on this it basically freely access
 
02:08:54.990 --> 02:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
use and employ computational
 
02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
resources does not in any
 
02:08:57.960 --> 02:09:00.629 align:start position:0%
resources does not in any
way

02:09:00.629 --> 02:09:00.639 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:09:02.950 --> 02:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
Define it it seems to undermine the
 
02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
basic concepts around around network
 
02:09:09.629 --> 02:09:09.639 align:start position:0%
security around um you know Network
 
02:09:11.709 --> 02:09:11.719 align:start position:0%
governance and ownership I it feels like
 
02:09:13.790 --> 02:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
there could be big unintended
 
02:09:16.069 --> 02:09:16.079 align:start position:0%
consequences if someone could basically
 
02:09:19.669 --> 02:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
say any restriction on their ability to
 
02:09:22.109 --> 02:09:22.119 align:start position:0%
compute could be could be interpreted as
 
02:09:24.270 --> 02:09:24.280 align:start position:0%
a violation of the State Constitution so
 
02:09:26.910 --> 02:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
I I do not support this so is there
 
02:09:28.390 --> 02:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
anyone represent bch I know you want to
 
02:09:30.669 --> 02:09:30.679 align:start position:0%
speak is there you've spoken before so
 
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
I'm and I'm not going to stop you from
 
02:09:33.069 --> 02:09:33.079 align:start position:0%
speaking but I just want to see before
 
02:09:34.669 --> 02:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
we get to you if there's anyone else who
 
02:09:37.149 --> 02:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
wants you to speak yeah all right go
 
02:09:41.390 --> 02:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
ahead I got it uh two thoughts and I'd
 
02:09:44.069 --> 02:09:44.079 align:start position:0%
like to to address uh my friend from
 
02:09:47.149 --> 02:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
across the aisle
 
02:09:51.430 --> 02:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
um am I correct in assuming that from
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
what you said the language shall not be
 
02:09:58.189 --> 02:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
infringed doesn't really mean shall not
 
02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
be infringed it's subject to all kinds
 
02:10:04.629 --> 02:10:04.639 align:start position:0%
of other things that you talked about
 
02:10:07.790 --> 02:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm concerned that we've had decades
 
02:10:11.350 --> 02:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
upon decades if not centuries of
 
02:10:14.629 --> 02:10:14.639 align:start position:0%
litigation in the Second Amendment World
 
02:10:17.669 --> 02:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
about that unfortunate language whether
 
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
you're on one side of the issue or the
 
02:10:23.030 --> 02:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
other so
 
02:10:27.069 --> 02:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
so if you agree that shall not be
 
02:10:29.629 --> 02:10:29.639 align:start position:0%
infringed doesn't really mean shall not
 
02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
be infringed but will be subject to
 
02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:33.549 align:start position:0%
be infringed but will be subject to
endless

02:10:33.549 --> 02:10:33.559 align:start position:0%
endless
 
02:10:40.950 --> 02:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
correctly Mr Speaker I guess I would ask
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
you whether or not we might have a show
 
02:10:50.669 --> 02:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
of hands as to sentiment on this because
 
02:10:53.470 --> 02:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
I I could be persuaded to withdraw my
 
02:10:56.149 --> 02:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
motion and make a motion to retain um
 
02:10:58.589 --> 02:10:58.599 align:start position:0%
how how many people here uh might we
 
02:11:02.430 --> 02:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
find out hang on hang on hang on the the
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh the mo the
 
02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
um well no that all right that's a fair
 
02:11:10.589 --> 02:11:10.599 align:start position:0%
point how many the motion has been to
 
02:11:13.109 --> 02:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
ought to pass if there's a if you're
 
02:11:15.270 --> 02:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
suggesting that might make more sense to
 
02:11:17.830 --> 02:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
retain this um sure let's have a show of
 
02:11:19.589 --> 02:11:19.599 align:start position:0%
hands how many people would support
 
02:11:26.750 --> 02:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:29.310 --> 02:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
okay how about OTP what's that how many
 
02:11:31.030 --> 02:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
people would support
 
02:11:33.270 --> 02:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
OTP I'm sorry I was just wondering how
 
02:11:34.990 --> 02:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
many people would support OTP oh how
 
02:11:37.629 --> 02:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
many people would oppose
 
02:11:40.390 --> 02:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
retain all right so you want to withdraw
 
02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:42.109 align:start position:0%
retain all right so you want to withdraw
your

02:11:42.109 --> 02:11:42.119 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
motion I I was just trying to assess Mr
 
02:11:47.350 --> 02:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman how many people might be in
 
02:11:49.750 --> 02:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
support of the original OTP motion it
 
02:11:53.109 --> 02:11:53.119 align:start position:0%
seems that there may not be a
 
02:11:55.629 --> 02:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
plurality no no no we didn't you didn't
 
02:11:58.470 --> 02:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
ask the qu if if you want to know how
 
02:12:00.990 --> 02:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
many people would support on a straw
 
02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:03.599 align:start position:0%
vote how many people would support OTP I
 
02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
think that's a different question that's
 
02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:14.430 --> 02:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
OTP all right so it it appears that we
 
02:12:16.350 --> 02:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
not that we would not have a majority to
 
02:12:19.790 --> 02:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
do that Mr Speaker I would uh be obliged
 
02:12:21.750 --> 02:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
if if you let me withdraw my motion and
 
02:12:24.790 --> 02:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
submit an alternative motion to retain
 
02:12:27.030 --> 02:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
this cacr I would allow you to do that

02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
made by uh representative uh Alexander
 
02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
seconded by uh representative Andress
 
02:19:49.150 --> 02:19:49.160 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander do you wish to
 
02:19:51.309 --> 02:19:51.319 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yeah yeah briefly
 
02:19:53.230 --> 02:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
this bill would appropriate $30,000 to
 
02:19:55.270 --> 02:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary for hiring a contractor to
 
02:19:56.990 --> 02:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
review domestic violence and stalking
 
02:20:00.190 --> 02:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
cases for the purposes of gathering data
 
02:20:02.230 --> 02:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
um the bill just lacks specificity
 
02:20:03.550 --> 02:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
regarding the type of data to be
 
02:20:05.950 --> 02:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
collected and its intended use um we
 
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
already feel or I feel that
 
02:20:10.349 --> 02:20:10.359 align:start position:0%
transitioning to electronic filing is
 
02:20:11.750 --> 02:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
going to solve a lot of these problems I
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
think the Court's already working on
 
02:20:14.550 --> 02:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
that so um I don't think this bill is
 
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
needed all right anyone else wish to be
 
02:20:18.429 --> 02:20:18.439 align:start position:0%
heard representative Manos yes thank you
 
02:20:20.389 --> 02:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I actually have an amendment to
 
02:20:23.190 --> 02:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
this bill which I circulated um and
 
02:20:26.270 --> 02:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
everybody has a copy of it and um I
 
02:20:29.670 --> 02:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
would like to move my Amendment um you
 
02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
can't you can't now well right I I
 
02:20:35.790 --> 02:20:35.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to be recognized I I thought I
 
02:20:39.550 --> 02:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
had been um granted the
 
02:20:45.309 --> 02:20:45.319 align:start position:0%
um the uh ability to be recognized um
 
02:20:49.030 --> 02:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
but if I then I will speak to um
 
02:20:51.469 --> 02:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
representative Alex what Al what
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander said if I may
 
02:20:58.110 --> 02:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
um my Amendment which uh I won't move
 
02:21:00.550 --> 02:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
yet because I haven't been uh recognized
 
02:21:03.469 --> 02:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
to do that but my Amendment would
 
02:21:05.469 --> 02:21:05.479 align:start position:0%
address the issue that representative
 
02:21:08.190 --> 02:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
Alexander raised and which was raised in
 
02:21:11.150 --> 02:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
the hearing on my bill uh which is the
 
02:21:13.309 --> 02:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
lack of specificity about what data
 
02:21:15.750 --> 02:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
would be collected and my Amendment
 
02:21:20.590 --> 02:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
specifies what data it is um I also
 
02:21:21.910 --> 02:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to address the issue of
 
02:21:25.030 --> 02:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
electronic filing um electronic filing
 
02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
is not done at this time in domestic
 
02:21:30.990 --> 02:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
violence cases and the judicial branch
 
02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
does not have the funding to um proceed
 
02:21:37.750 --> 02:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
with electronic filing there are also
 
02:21:40.670 --> 02:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
concerns about whether some victims of
 
02:21:43.389 --> 02:21:43.399 align:start position:0%
domestic violence who want to file may
 
02:21:46.670 --> 02:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
not have access to electronic filing or
 
02:21:49.469 --> 02:21:49.479 align:start position:0%
may fear for their safety in the process
 
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
of filing electronically so I think
 
02:21:55.030 --> 02:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately that uh in the future when
 
02:21:57.309 --> 02:21:57.319 align:start position:0%
the court system moves toward electronic
 
02:22:00.429 --> 02:22:00.439 align:start position:0%
filing and domestic violence cases that
 
02:22:02.110 --> 02:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully there will also be an
 
02:22:06.349 --> 02:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
alternative to um for victims to
 
02:22:11.389 --> 02:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
continue to file paper on paper um so I
 
02:22:16.190 --> 02:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
would um oppose represented I would
 
02:22:18.190 --> 02:22:18.200 align:start position:0%

itl um and
 
02:22:25.630 --> 02:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that my um Amendment
 
02:22:28.910 --> 02:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
would do is to um add some language
 
02:22:28.920 --> 02:22:29.910 align:start position:0%
would do is to um add some language
about

02:22:29.910 --> 02:22:29.920 align:start position:0%

02:25:26.670 --> 02:25:26.680 align:start position:0%

02:25:33.950 --> 02:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:25:38.349 --> 02:25:38.359 align:start position:0%
um 88 hang on one
 
02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:45.309 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:25:45.309 --> 02:25:45.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:25:51.070 --> 02:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
um all right and so um I would move
 
02:25:54.389 --> 02:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
02:25:57.030 --> 02:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
with two
 
02:25:57.040 --> 02:25:58.910 align:start position:0%
with two
amendments

02:25:58.910 --> 02:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
02:26:01.550 --> 02:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
um no I know I understand I assume we do
 
02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
have to do two um so I I I guess what I
 
02:26:08.750 --> 02:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
would say is I would um move ought to
 
02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
pass uh first with Amendment
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
20257 H and is there a
 
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
second second by representative uh Perez
 
02:26:27.670 --> 02:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
all right um and if I could speak uh
 
02:26:32.429 --> 02:26:32.439 align:start position:0%
just briefly to uh the am the amendment
 
02:26:35.190 --> 02:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
um the amendment in question prepared by
 
02:26:37.110 --> 02:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire is basically
 
02:26:39.870 --> 02:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
designed to make it clear that the that
 
02:26:42.030 --> 02:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
the establishment of the Community
 
02:26:46.230 --> 02:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
Property Trust um is not to be in
 
02:26:47.950 --> 02:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
derogation of the rights of any
 
02:26:50.830 --> 02:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
creditors or people who have uh uh
 
02:26:53.269 --> 02:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
some uh lean or other security interest
 
02:26:56.150 --> 02:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
in the property it it um I think if I
 
02:26:58.190 --> 02:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
recall correctly from the hearing I
 
02:27:00.070 --> 02:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
think representative Burch you may have
 
02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
suggested that this needed to be done I
 
02:27:03.910 --> 02:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
think representative Maguire agreed and
 
02:27:06.870 --> 02:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
and did that um so I think the amendment
 
02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh makes perfect sense um and I ask you
 
02:27:12.630 --> 02:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
to support the amendment anyone else
 
02:27:14.349 --> 02:27:14.359 align:start position:0%
wish to be heard on the
 
02:27:18.389 --> 02:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
amendment all right um then um is that
 
02:27:21.269 --> 02:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
something we can do by a show of hand
 
02:27:24.150 --> 02:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
on on the amendment um so all those in
 
02:27:26.150 --> 02:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
favor this is on the amendment only all
 
02:27:29.710 --> 02:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
those in favor of amendment
 
02:27:35.230 --> 02:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:38.190 --> 02:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
hand representative trip okay um let me
 
02:27:40.429 --> 02:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
just make sure I think we are unanimous
 
02:27:45.830 --> 02:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
all right so um on that Amendment we're
 
02:27:48.150 --> 02:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
unanimous um hang on I just want to make
 
02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
all right then next I would turn to
 
02:28:12.349 --> 02:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment um uh
 
02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
015h which is uh representative burch's
 
02:28:17.950 --> 02:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I would move that
 
02:28:22.590 --> 02:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:26.150 --> 02:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
that all right
 
02:28:52.790 --> 02:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:55.830 --> 02:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
second Alexander all right um and so on
 
02:28:55.840 --> 02:28:57.349 align:start position:0%
second Alexander all right um and so on
this

02:28:57.349 --> 02:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:29:00.190 --> 02:29:00.200 align:start position:0%
um on
 
02:29:03.550 --> 02:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
uh this amendment uh basically this uh
 
02:29:05.910 --> 02:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
this deletes section one of the bill
 
02:29:08.110 --> 02:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
which I think would have would have if
 
02:29:10.630 --> 02:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
we hadn't removed that it would have uh
 
02:29:13.309 --> 02:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
impacted the real estate transfer tax is
 
02:29:15.710 --> 02:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
that correct and so uh representative
 
02:29:15.720 --> 02:29:16.870 align:start position:0%
that correct and so uh representative
Burch

02:29:16.870 --> 02:29:16.880 align:start position:0%

correctly uh representative McGuire
 
02:29:21.790 --> 02:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
agreed uh removed section one and
 
02:29:23.910 --> 02:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
redesignated sections two and three as
 
02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
sections one and two again very common
 
02:29:28.870 --> 02:29:28.880 align:start position:0%

02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
anybody have any want anyone want to
 
02:29:33.070 --> 02:29:33.080 align:start position:0%

02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
call for a show of hands um all those in
 
02:29:40.190 --> 02:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
favor of amendment
 
02:29:45.190 --> 02:29:45.200 align:start position:0%

um all right so now we're on to the to
 
02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
the main motion um the bill with with
 
02:30:07.269 --> 02:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
those two
 
02:30:12.230 --> 02:30:12.240 align:start position:0%

02:30:28.469 --> 02:30:28.479 align:start position:0%

02:30:28.479 --> 02:30:29.950 align:start position:0%
by um representative Lynn seconded by uh
representative

02:30:29.950 --> 02:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:30:29.960 --> 02:30:31.910 align:start position:0%
representative
Perez

02:30:31.910 --> 02:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
Perez
 
02:30:35.469 --> 02:30:35.479 align:start position:0%
um and I guess I would like to speak to
 
02:30:40.190 --> 02:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
uh the motion uh just briefly um I think
 
02:30:44.790 --> 02:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
this bill makes sense um as I and I I
 
02:30:46.469 --> 02:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
have to say this was an area of the law
 
02:30:49.550 --> 02:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
that I was not uh I'm not a tax lawyer I
 
02:30:51.870 --> 02:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
was not particularly familiar with but
 
02:30:54.870 --> 02:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
um basically as I recall the
 
02:30:58.030 --> 02:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
testimony um it you have a situation
 
02:31:02.670 --> 02:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
where if the if you have a community
 
02:31:05.309 --> 02:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
property if you have a law like this
 
02:31:08.070 --> 02:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
established and I the example that I
 
02:31:11.630 --> 02:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
recall from the testimony was you have
 
02:31:15.670 --> 02:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
this situation husband and wife um have
 
02:31:18.750 --> 02:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
property in a trust that is not a
 
02:31:20.990 --> 02:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
community property Trust
 
02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
husband dies the property goes to the
 
02:31:29.630 --> 02:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
wife wife now wants to convey the
 
02:31:33.590 --> 02:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
property um to some third person um
 
02:31:36.790 --> 02:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
under the as I understand it under if
 
02:31:39.150 --> 02:31:39.160 align:start position:0%
it's not Community Property Trust what
 
02:31:43.030 --> 02:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
the IRS will say is
 
02:31:47.469 --> 02:31:47.479 align:start position:0%
okay that Pro the the the portion of
 
02:31:49.230 --> 02:31:49.240 align:start position:0%
that property which represents the
 
02:31:53.110 --> 02:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
deceased husband's interest the wife
 
02:31:56.469 --> 02:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
gets a stepped up basis in that property
 
02:31:59.309 --> 02:31:59.319 align:start position:0%
so that if she then sells the property
 
02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
there is no capital gains tax on
 
02:32:06.309 --> 02:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
um let's assume in my example she sells
 
02:32:08.309 --> 02:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
it immediately so there's no further
 
02:32:10.670 --> 02:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
rise in the property while she owns it
 
02:32:12.750 --> 02:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
so there's there's there's no capital
 
02:32:16.150 --> 02:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
gains tax on the portion of the sale of
 
02:32:18.429 --> 02:32:18.439 align:start position:0%
the property that represents the
 
02:32:18.439 --> 02:32:20.110 align:start position:0%
the property that represents the
husbands

02:32:20.110 --> 02:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
husbands
 
02:32:21.510 --> 02:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
the deceased husband's interest because
 
02:32:24.389 --> 02:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
there's a stepped up basis in that but
 
02:32:27.349 --> 02:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
the portion that represents the wife's
 
02:32:30.389 --> 02:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
interest from before there that is not
 
02:32:32.990 --> 02:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
subject to the stepped up basis and so
 
02:32:36.070 --> 02:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
the um for that part of the property the
 
02:32:37.870 --> 02:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
the wife has to pay the capital gains
 
02:32:40.590 --> 02:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
tax on the the difference between the
 
02:32:43.309 --> 02:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
value when the property was acquired and
 
02:32:46.110 --> 02:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
the value when it was sold
 
02:32:48.950 --> 02:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
whereas if the commun if this was in a
 
02:32:50.469 --> 02:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
community property
 
02:32:53.269 --> 02:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
trust the way the IRS would treat this
 
02:32:56.950 --> 02:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
is there would be no capital gains tax
 
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
due at all um it seems to me that for
 
02:33:02.389 --> 02:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
people and you know and this bill
 
02:33:04.950 --> 02:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't require anybody to have a a a
 
02:33:07.070 --> 02:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
community property trust but it seems to
 
02:33:10.670 --> 02:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
me that um to allow people to take
 
02:33:12.309 --> 02:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
advantage of a community property trust
 
02:33:13.830 --> 02:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
in that circumstance makes sense why
 
02:33:15.710 --> 02:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
should they why shouldn't they be able
 
02:33:19.590 --> 02:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
to avoid having to pay the tax which uh
 
02:33:21.269 --> 02:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
uh you know I think if I recall
 
02:33:23.590 --> 02:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
correctly there representative Burch you
 
02:33:25.269 --> 02:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
may correct me if I'm wrong but I
 
02:33:27.309 --> 02:33:27.319 align:start position:0%
thought that representative Maguire said
 
02:33:29.710 --> 02:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
there's like 15 states or something that
 
02:33:32.230 --> 02:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
have this um I think that's right I
 
02:33:34.389 --> 02:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
don't know but I think I mean it's a
 
02:33:36.910 --> 02:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
number of states have it so it seems it
 
02:33:38.950 --> 02:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
seems to me that this makes sense I I'm
 
02:33:41.510 --> 02:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
not sure I understand what would be the
 
02:33:44.830 --> 02:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
argument of not doing this um unless you
 
02:33:46.190 --> 02:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
know unless you want people to pay more
 
02:33:48.830 --> 02:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
taxes maybe that's that's okay uh but
 
02:33:50.710 --> 02:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
representative Manos
 
02:33:52.710 --> 02:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to make the argument against
 
02:33:55.990 --> 02:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
the bill um so my concern is from the
 
02:33:58.710 --> 02:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
perspective of an attorney who practices
 
02:34:04.910 --> 02:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
family law and um it's clear on uh page
 
02:34:06.349 --> 02:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
02:34:10.750 --> 02:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
bill um line 16 that dissolution which
 
02:34:12.469 --> 02:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
mean would mean dissolution of the
 
02:34:14.830 --> 02:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
Community Property Trust would include
 
02:34:19.190 --> 02:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
divorce among other um other uh terms
 
02:34:22.070 --> 02:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
here and then it says on page three of
 
02:34:25.389 --> 02:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
the bill on line 10 dissolution of
 
02:34:27.790 --> 02:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
marriage termination of trust upon the
 
02:34:29.469 --> 02:34:29.479 align:start position:0%
dissolution of the marriage of the
 
02:34:32.190 --> 02:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
settler spouses the Community Property
 
02:34:35.030 --> 02:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
Trust shall terminate and the trustee
 
02:34:37.590 --> 02:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
shall distribute one half of the trust
 
02:34:40.590 --> 02:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
assets to each spouse with each spouse
 
02:34:43.349 --> 02:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
receiving one half of each asset unless
 
02:34:45.349 --> 02:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise agreed to in writing by both
 
02:34:49.230 --> 02:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
spouses what that implies to me um is
 
02:34:51.710 --> 02:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
that the Court would lose jurisdiction
 
02:34:55.990 --> 02:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
over treating the asset as a marital
 
02:34:58.590 --> 02:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
asset and being able to equitably
 
02:35:02.110 --> 02:35:02.120 align:start position:0%
divided in the circumstance of a divorce
 
02:35:04.550 --> 02:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
or dissolution of the marriage for other
 
02:35:07.870 --> 02:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
reasons um this to me from my
 
02:35:10.230 --> 02:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
perspective basically would turn not
 
02:35:13.349 --> 02:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
basically would turn New Hampshire into
 
02:35:16.469 --> 02:35:16.479 align:start position:0%
a community property State for the
 
02:35:20.309 --> 02:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
purposes of divorce um
 
02:35:25.550 --> 02:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
and I strongly oppose that so um I don't
 
02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
support this bill I don't support this
 
02:35:30.590 --> 02:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
so you know I guess I'm not clear so
 
02:35:32.190 --> 02:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
let's assume that you're right that it
 
02:35:33.950 --> 02:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
would turn it in what what do you say
 
02:35:36.190 --> 02:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
are the implications of that this is a
 
02:35:38.030 --> 02:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
as I understand that these are these
 
02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
trusts are revocable trusts so the as I
 
02:35:43.389 --> 02:35:43.399 align:start position:0%
understand I think it's pretty clear the
 
02:35:45.469 --> 02:35:45.479 align:start position:0%
court can do whatever it wants with a
 
02:35:50.269 --> 02:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
revocable trust I I think as um as
 
02:35:54.950 --> 02:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
page three lines 10 through 13 I think
 
02:35:58.269 --> 02:35:58.279 align:start position:0%
make it clear that the court would lose
 
02:36:00.389 --> 02:36:00.399 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over being able to
 
02:36:03.950 --> 02:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
equitably divide the marital property um
 
02:36:06.070 --> 02:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
viewing this as marital property and
 
02:36:09.429 --> 02:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
being able to equitably divide it I
 
02:36:12.670 --> 02:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
think the other thing is um and I think
 
02:36:14.990 --> 02:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
the other way in which that's emphasized
 
02:36:21.110 --> 02:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
is on page two lines 7 through 11 which
 
02:36:22.590 --> 02:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
make it
 
02:36:22.600 --> 02:36:24.150 align:start position:0%
make it
clear

02:36:24.150 --> 02:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
clear
 
02:36:28.550 --> 02:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
um that there is legal risk here in in
 
02:36:32.429 --> 02:36:32.439 align:start position:0%
uh entering into such an agreement um I
 
02:36:35.910 --> 02:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
am also not a tax attorney and I I so I
 
02:36:40.150 --> 02:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
don't know tax law but it it seems to
 
02:36:45.150 --> 02:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
me if I think about my own family that
 
02:36:50.030 --> 02:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
if a if a um house is own joint
 
02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
if the marital home is owned jointly and
 
02:36:54.950 --> 02:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
one of the spouses
 
02:36:57.710 --> 02:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
dies that the other
 
02:37:02.309 --> 02:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
spouse does receive a steed up basis so
 
02:37:06.630 --> 02:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not and that the sale of the house
 
02:37:09.990 --> 02:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
by the Survivor spouse is
 
02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
a non- taxable event is and I could be
 
02:37:17.349 --> 02:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
very well be wrong about that but that's
 
02:37:20.630 --> 02:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
my memory from my own family
 
02:37:23.750 --> 02:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
situation but I don't know but anyway
 
02:37:26.349 --> 02:37:26.359 align:start position:0%
for those reasons I oppose this this
 
02:37:29.190 --> 02:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
bill anyone else wish to be heard on on
 
02:37:31.550 --> 02:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
the bill right so I guess I would say
 
02:37:33.389 --> 02:37:33.399 align:start position:0%
the only thing I would say about that I
 
02:37:38.230 --> 02:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
I just I I do not see how you could read
 
02:37:40.190 --> 02:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
the language that you're saying to to to
 
02:37:42.269 --> 02:37:42.279 align:start position:0%
sort of house the court of its
 
02:37:46.110 --> 02:37:46.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to um to divide property
 
02:37:48.990 --> 02:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
that's in a that's in a revocable trust
 
02:37:51.790 --> 02:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
I mean I just don't I I don't think that
 
02:37:54.389 --> 02:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
I don't I think the court would retain
 
02:37:55.870 --> 02:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
that that language would not in any way
 
02:37:57.790 --> 02:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
prevent the court from from having the
 
02:38:00.670 --> 02:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to to you know do whatever
 
02:38:02.950 --> 02:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
it felt was Equitable in the
 
02:38:05.790 --> 02:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances again if I may it it says
 
02:38:08.349 --> 02:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
unless otherwise agreed to uh this is
 
02:38:10.990 --> 02:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
line 13 on page three unless otherwise
 
02:38:14.030 --> 02:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
agreed to in writing by both spouses so
 
02:38:17.750 --> 02:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that um unless there's a
 
02:38:19.870 --> 02:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
mutual agreement by the spouses on
 
02:38:22.190 --> 02:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
divorce that again that the court is
 
02:38:24.469 --> 02:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
deprived of jurisdiction to me this
 
02:38:26.750 --> 02:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
would be analogous to the situation
 
02:38:28.870 --> 02:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
where the court and I can't remember if
 
02:38:30.309 --> 02:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
you were on the court at the time of
 
02:38:33.349 --> 02:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
this decision but the decision that said
 
02:38:37.389 --> 02:38:37.399 align:start position:0%
unless spouses agree to the payment of
 
02:38:40.630 --> 02:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education for their minor
 
02:38:43.510 --> 02:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
children that the court uh that the
 
02:38:45.870 --> 02:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
court does not have the ability to order
 
02:38:48.830 --> 02:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
parents to pay for postsecondary
 
02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:50.429 align:start position:0%
parents to pay for postsecondary
education

02:38:50.429 --> 02:38:50.439 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:38:52.710 --> 02:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
now parents can agree that they will but
 
02:38:55.269 --> 02:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
if they don't then the court can't order
 
02:38:58.590 --> 02:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
them to and I would I would view this as
 
02:39:00.910 --> 02:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
an AAL an
 
02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:02.990 align:start position:0%
an AAL an
analogous

02:39:02.990 --> 02:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
analogous
 
02:39:06.030 --> 02:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
situation um so that raises concerns for
 
02:39:08.710 --> 02:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
me okay all right I I I guess I don't I
 
02:39:10.190 --> 02:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
don't see it but that's that's fine
 
02:39:12.349 --> 02:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
that's your view um all right anyone
 
02:39:14.389 --> 02:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
else wish to be heard on
 
02:39:18.110 --> 02:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
this all right so the motion then is
 
02:39:21.070 --> 02:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
otpa with the two amendments and I'd ask

02:42:36.790 --> 02:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
motion just uh very briefly this is an
 
02:42:38.910 --> 02:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
issue which has been before this
 
02:42:42.349 --> 02:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
committee um if I hope I don't offend
 
02:42:44.590 --> 02:42:44.600 align:start position:0%
anyone when I say
 
02:42:50.230 --> 02:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
adium and it is because it is an issue
 
02:42:52.990 --> 02:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
which um is unbelievably
 
02:43:00.550 --> 02:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
serious and um in which we have uh
 
02:43:06.030 --> 02:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
constantly finding out um new realities
 
02:43:10.230 --> 02:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
about the situation in which the
 
02:43:10.240 --> 02:43:11.990 align:start position:0%
about the situation in which the
pest

02:43:11.990 --> 02:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
pest
 
02:43:17.750 --> 02:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
chemicals um have created uh serious
 
02:43:20.190 --> 02:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
life affecting problems
 
02:43:22.910 --> 02:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
some of which are
 
02:43:26.230 --> 02:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
not are not
 
02:43:30.830 --> 02:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
actually visible or
 
02:43:30.840 --> 02:43:32.510 align:start position:0%
actually visible or
um

02:43:32.510 --> 02:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:35.309 --> 02:43:35.319 align:start position:0%
knowing um for a number of years
 
02:43:38.670 --> 02:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
particularly those affecting
 
02:43:43.110 --> 02:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
children where it is not until uh they
 
02:43:48.230 --> 02:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
enter puberty or later where um it is
 
02:43:53.429 --> 02:43:53.439 align:start position:0%
possible to discover the serious damage
 
02:43:56.670 --> 02:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
that has been done all that this bill
 
02:43:59.389 --> 02:43:59.399 align:start position:0%
does is recognize
 
02:44:05.429 --> 02:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
reality and um ask that we extend um for
 
02:44:07.830 --> 02:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
a a reasonable period of
 
02:44:11.830 --> 02:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
time uh the
 
02:44:16.429 --> 02:44:16.439 align:start position:0%
uh the opportunity for people affected
 
02:44:20.670 --> 02:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
negatively by pasas to seek
 
02:44:23.670 --> 02:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
redress all right anyone else um wish to
 
02:44:26.070 --> 02:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
be heard on this representative
 
02:44:29.230 --> 02:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
tur yeah I just wanted to highlight you
 
02:44:32.630 --> 02:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
know from our testimony on this bill um
 
02:44:35.389 --> 02:44:35.399 align:start position:0%
the distinction that I believe was made
 
02:44:37.630 --> 02:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of when you acknowledge or
 
02:44:40.190 --> 02:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
should be able to know that you had been
 
02:44:42.750 --> 02:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
exposed versus the statute of
 
02:44:46.429 --> 02:44:46.439 align:start position:0%
limitations when you might actually be
 
02:44:49.550 --> 02:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
able to bring successfully or decide
 
02:44:52.670 --> 02:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
that you have enough uh evidence
 
02:44:56.070 --> 02:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
available to bring successfully a um a
 
02:45:00.349 --> 02:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
suit under under that um
 
02:45:02.630 --> 02:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
requirement in an area like this it's
 
02:45:05.230 --> 02:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
not it was mentioned that that you know
 
02:45:06.750 --> 02:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
over a certain period of time the
 
02:45:10.230 --> 02:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
evidence gets gets stale and stagnant
 
02:45:12.590 --> 02:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
and the witnesses this is not a once
 
02:45:14.190 --> 02:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
this is not an event that happens to
 
02:45:17.710 --> 02:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
someone at one point in time um you know
 
02:45:19.230 --> 02:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
like being hit by a car this is
 
02:45:21.110 --> 02:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
something where
 
02:45:24.670 --> 02:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
the fact of your exposure and your
 
02:45:26.790 --> 02:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
damage takes a long time to understand
 
02:45:28.950 --> 02:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
and probably takes even longer than that
 
02:45:33.630 --> 02:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
to um to reach the point where you
 
02:45:38.469 --> 02:45:38.479 align:start position:0%
believe you reasonably have enough uh
 
02:45:41.309 --> 02:45:41.319 align:start position:0%
accumulated knowledge or science to
 
02:45:44.389 --> 02:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
prove that that your injury was related
 
02:45:47.429 --> 02:45:47.439 align:start position:0%
so I think it's different than a lot of
 
02:45:49.790 --> 02:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
other statute of limitation cas es and
 
02:45:51.790 --> 02:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
the analogies that were presented I
 
02:45:54.389 --> 02:45:54.399 align:start position:0%
think don't really apply so I I think
 
02:45:56.990 --> 02:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
this would be reasonable and unlike in
 
02:45:58.990 --> 02:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
the past it doesn't leave the window
 
02:46:01.750 --> 02:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
open forever it just extends it right
 
02:46:04.150 --> 02:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard all right
 
02:46:06.510 --> 02:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
so I guess what I would say is I I know
 
02:46:09.550 --> 02:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
I I my my sense is that that on my side
 
02:46:12.070 --> 02:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
of the aisle that we are split on this
 
02:46:14.950 --> 02:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
to some extent my I plan to vote against
 
02:46:18.389 --> 02:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
this bill for this reason I think that
 
02:46:21.990 --> 02:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
um the um I don't disagree with what you
 
02:46:23.670 --> 02:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
said representative Tura that there are
 
02:46:25.590 --> 02:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
you know that there could be that there
 
02:46:28.070 --> 02:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
that injuries in this kind of situation
 
02:46:29.830 --> 02:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
are different than say a car accident or
 
02:46:31.190 --> 02:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
something like that which is a discreet
 
02:46:36.790 --> 02:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
event but there are many me I I um I I
 
02:46:38.910 --> 02:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
the example that comes to mind is
 
02:46:43.030 --> 02:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
asbestos cases um there you know th
 
02:46:46.150 --> 02:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
those those cases in fact those they've
 
02:46:49.070 --> 02:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
been going on for decades and and in
 
02:46:52.550 --> 02:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
fact there are still some asbestos cases
 
02:46:57.550 --> 02:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
that that um that uh are brought now
 
02:46:59.870 --> 02:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
involving uh exposures that happened
 
02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
years and years and years ago another
 
02:47:06.389 --> 02:47:06.399 align:start position:0%
example of that might be um the YDC
 
02:47:08.309 --> 02:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
cases I mean there are Casa those those
 
02:47:13.030 --> 02:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
cases go back decades um and and involve
 
02:47:16.469 --> 02:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
at least as as to the claims against the
 
02:47:20.309 --> 02:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
state as opposed to against particular
 
02:47:23.790 --> 02:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
um officers uh but it claims against the
 
02:47:26.190 --> 02:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
state um it it really is sort of a
 
02:47:28.830 --> 02:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
similar thing because the claim the the
 
02:47:31.269 --> 02:47:31.279 align:start position:0%
basis of the theory of liability against
 
02:47:35.590 --> 02:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
the state is well maybe at maybe at you
 
02:47:38.469 --> 02:47:38.479 align:start position:0%
know some discret time the state
 
02:47:40.670 --> 02:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have known that there that the
 
02:47:43.269 --> 02:47:43.279 align:start position:0%
abuse was going on but at some point
 
02:47:45.830 --> 02:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
they the state did the state should have
 
02:47:48.910 --> 02:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
known and and it was reasonable for them
 
02:47:53.150 --> 02:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
to have done something so I think that
 
02:47:57.230 --> 02:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
um the way the discovery rule Works
 
02:47:59.269 --> 02:47:59.279 align:start position:0%
whether the statute of limitations is
 
02:48:03.150 --> 02:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
three years or six years or 20 years or
 
02:48:04.830 --> 02:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
um well I guess it wouldn't apply might
 
02:48:06.389 --> 02:48:06.399 align:start position:0%
be different if it was never but
 
02:48:07.870 --> 02:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
whatever the length of the statute of
 
02:48:10.630 --> 02:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
limitations is what you're basically
 
02:48:13.670 --> 02:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
saying given the discovery rule is
 
02:48:17.950 --> 02:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
whoever the injured person is once they
 
02:48:20.670 --> 02:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
know or should know that they've been
 
02:48:23.030 --> 02:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
injured and they know or should know
 
02:48:25.990 --> 02:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
that it was caused by the person uh by
 
02:48:28.870 --> 02:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
the business or entity that um was
 
02:48:33.070 --> 02:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
involved in past that they they have the
 
02:48:35.389 --> 02:48:35.399 align:start position:0%
period of the statute of limitations to
 
02:48:38.110 --> 02:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
then sit on their hands and do nothing
 
02:48:39.830 --> 02:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
and it just doesn't seem to me that it
 
02:48:41.630 --> 02:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
makes sense where the statute of
 
02:48:45.630 --> 02:48:45.640 align:start position:0%
limitations doesn't start to run until
 
02:48:47.110 --> 02:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
you know or should know that you've been
 
02:48:48.870 --> 02:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
injured and you know or should know that
 
02:48:51.550 --> 02:48:51.560 align:start position:0%
it's caused by the defendant you're
 
02:48:54.469 --> 02:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
planning to Sue that if once you know
 
02:48:56.590 --> 02:48:56.600 align:start position:0%
those two things you should be able to
 
02:48:59.429 --> 02:48:59.439 align:start position:0%
sit on your hands for 20 years it's
 
02:49:01.550 --> 02:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
sitting on your hands for six years it
 
02:49:03.750 --> 02:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
seems to me is already twice what the
 
02:49:06.230 --> 02:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
usual statute of limitations is to now
 
02:49:08.870 --> 02:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
extend that to 20 years I just don't I
 
02:49:11.110 --> 02:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
just don't understand the basis for that
 
02:49:15.070 --> 02:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
representative Smith uh thank you um
 
02:49:18.910 --> 02:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
very much could you explain to me why
 
02:49:21.510 --> 02:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
why you would
 
02:49:23.389 --> 02:49:23.399 align:start position:0%
suggest that
 
02:49:23.399 --> 02:49:24.990 align:start position:0%
suggest that
anyone

02:49:24.990 --> 02:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
02:49:29.550 --> 02:49:29.560 align:start position:0%
would um sit on their hands for a year
 
02:49:33.990 --> 02:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
two years 10 years 20 years um once it
 
02:49:38.590 --> 02:49:38.600 align:start position:0%
became clear to them that the problems
 
02:49:40.830 --> 02:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
they were facing in terms of health
 
02:49:42.670 --> 02:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
related issues which is what we're
 
02:49:47.469 --> 02:49:47.479 align:start position:0%
talking about um were likely caused by
 
02:49:50.510 --> 02:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
pasas um
 
02:49:53.830 --> 02:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
I I'm having trouble imagining unless I
 
02:49:55.910 --> 02:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
were really
 
02:49:58.269 --> 02:49:58.279 align:start position:0%
really I don't know and it's not even a
 
02:50:00.750 --> 02:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
question of cynicism uh why would
 
02:50:04.150 --> 02:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
anybody sit on their hands isn't it a
 
02:50:07.110 --> 02:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
question of when they find out or when
 
02:50:09.590 --> 02:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
they realize or when the connections are
 
02:50:13.229 --> 02:50:13.239 align:start position:0%
made that they
 
02:50:17.950 --> 02:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
um that they can act um I can't see what
 
02:50:20.269 --> 02:50:20.279 align:start position:0%
anyone would stand to
 
02:50:23.630 --> 02:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
gain by sitting on their hands am I am I
 
02:50:26.269 --> 02:50:26.279 align:start position:0%
missing something well I know I I mean I
 
02:50:29.830 --> 02:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
I I I think the problem is that you're I
 
02:50:32.510 --> 02:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
think what you're missing if to the
 
02:50:34.990 --> 02:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
extent you say that is the way the
 
02:50:38.429 --> 02:50:38.439 align:start position:0%
discovery rule operates because it it
 
02:50:42.150 --> 02:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
gives you it doesn't the statute doesn't
 
02:50:44.110 --> 02:50:44.120 align:start position:0%
start to run until those things two
 
02:50:46.590 --> 02:50:46.600 align:start position:0%
things that I said before were were
 
02:50:51.389 --> 02:50:51.399 align:start position:0%
exist and so given that you know whether
 
02:50:54.510 --> 02:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
the statute is 6 years or 20 years
 
02:50:56.550 --> 02:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't really make much difference in
 
02:51:00.150 --> 02:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
terms of of fairness to the person
 
02:51:02.150 --> 02:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
that's been injured because you have
 
02:51:04.630 --> 02:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
that time I mean that's why as I say the
 
02:51:08.030 --> 02:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
yd that's why the YDC cases as far as I
 
02:51:09.510 --> 02:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
know the statute of limitations from the
 
02:51:12.790 --> 02:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
YDC cases is three years but the the
 
02:51:14.670 --> 02:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
injuries that that happened there were
 
02:51:16.630 --> 02:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
happened happened in the late 80s or
 
02:51:18.190 --> 02:51:18.200 align:start position:0%
even earlier some of them I think go
 
02:51:20.750 --> 02:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
back and as far as maybe the 60s but
 
02:51:23.070 --> 02:51:23.080 align:start position:0%
those people have been able to bring CL
 
02:51:25.269 --> 02:51:25.279 align:start position:0%
claims because they were relying on the
 
02:51:27.389 --> 02:51:27.399 align:start position:0%
Discovery rule even under the three-year
 
02:51:29.590 --> 02:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
statute of limitation so I guess what
 
02:51:31.309 --> 02:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
I'm really saying is I don't see the
 
02:51:35.269 --> 02:51:35.279 align:start position:0%
need I mean it you know I completely
 
02:51:39.870 --> 02:51:39.880 align:start position:0%
agree that P is a huge problem um but I
 
02:51:42.950 --> 02:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
don't think that it makes sense to have
 
02:51:45.229 --> 02:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
a special rule that doesn't really
 
02:51:46.910 --> 02:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
accomplish very much
 
02:51:49.750 --> 02:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
because because of the Discovery that's
 
02:51:52.110 --> 02:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
that's my view Mr
 
02:51:54.630 --> 02:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
shair yes uh well let me see
 
02:51:56.309 --> 02:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
representative Perez then representative
 
02:51:57.990 --> 02:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
bur then representative McFarland
 
02:52:00.830 --> 02:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative Perez need and harm there
 
02:52:03.790 --> 02:52:03.800 align:start position:0%
may not be a need for it but people who
 
02:52:06.870 --> 02:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
do not understand that the statute that
 
02:52:10.389 --> 02:52:10.399 align:start position:0%
it starts at the discovery those of us
 
02:52:12.269 --> 02:52:12.279 align:start position:0%
that are not lawyers may look at this
 
02:52:15.790 --> 02:52:15.800 align:start position:0%
law and say and read it and say it says
 
02:52:17.990 --> 02:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
um it's it's six years oh it's been
 
02:52:20.429 --> 02:52:20.439 align:start position:0%
longer than six years so I can't do it
 
02:52:23.190 --> 02:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned there's no harm
 
02:52:25.229 --> 02:52:25.239 align:start position:0%
in putting it as far as I'm concerned we
 
02:52:27.630 --> 02:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
are going to have more than Past coming
 
02:52:31.269 --> 02:52:31.279 align:start position:0%
up with these um problems there's going
 
02:52:33.190 --> 02:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of things that are going to
 
02:52:35.269 --> 02:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
come up that are going to have to be
 
02:52:37.590 --> 02:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
extended extended it's certainly not
 
02:52:39.110 --> 02:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
going to be long enough for all the
 
02:52:41.150 --> 02:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
things that are happening to Children
 
02:52:43.670 --> 02:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
right now to be only three years of a
 
02:52:46.269 --> 02:52:46.279 align:start position:0%
statue so I don't see the harm in doing
 
02:52:50.309 --> 02:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
this representative Burch
 
02:52:50.319 --> 02:52:51.269 align:start position:0%
this representative Burch
you

02:52:51.269 --> 02:52:51.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:52:53.990 --> 02:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
suggested that we shouldn't have a
 
02:52:58.070 --> 02:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
special rule for this as opposed to
 
02:53:01.309 --> 02:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
other similar kind of
 
02:53:05.790 --> 02:53:05.800 align:start position:0%
cases my suggestion is that statute of
 
02:53:07.110 --> 02:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
statutes of
 
02:53:11.830 --> 02:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
limitation are themselves a Special Rule
 
02:53:13.950 --> 02:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
so we start with the general
 
02:53:16.750 --> 02:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
proposition that everybody is entitled
 
02:53:19.070 --> 02:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
to their day in court
 
02:53:21.950 --> 02:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
and I think as a general proposition we
 
02:53:26.590 --> 02:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
should be able to agree on that concept
 
02:53:28.590 --> 02:53:28.600 align:start position:0%
that everybody's entitled to their day
 
02:53:31.469 --> 02:53:31.479 align:start position:0%
in court statutes of limitation which
 
02:53:34.349 --> 02:53:34.359 align:start position:0%
are increasingly falling out of
 
02:53:38.309 --> 02:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
favor say well there should be some
 
02:53:41.550 --> 02:53:41.560 align:start position:0%
limitation because the memory of people
 
02:53:44.910 --> 02:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
fade over time the access to Witnesses
 
02:53:48.229 --> 02:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
fade over time now keep in mind that's
 
02:53:50.950 --> 02:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
PE people stuff that's not documents
 
02:53:55.950 --> 02:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
it's not records and the like so as we
 
02:53:59.469 --> 02:53:59.479 align:start position:0%
develop in the informational age more
 
02:54:02.910 --> 02:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
and more ways of documenting things and
 
02:54:04.910 --> 02:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
more and more ways of preserving
 
02:54:08.750 --> 02:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge the need for for limited
 
02:54:12.030 --> 02:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
statutes of limitation get less and less
 
02:54:14.710 --> 02:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
which is why they're being expanded
 
02:54:19.110 --> 02:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
across the board you bring up the idea
 
02:54:21.670 --> 02:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
of the uh the
 
02:54:25.830 --> 02:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
YDC but we also know that in cases for
 
02:54:29.870 --> 02:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
instance of sexual assault we are
 
02:54:32.389 --> 02:54:32.399 align:start position:0%
expanding and expanding and expanding
 
02:54:35.030 --> 02:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
the statute of limitation because of a
 
02:54:37.590 --> 02:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons a lot of people who
 
02:54:39.910 --> 02:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
are sexually assaulted have various
 
02:54:42.150 --> 02:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
reasons they don't want to come forward
 
02:54:44.550 --> 02:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
when they're 12 they may want to come
 
02:54:46.670 --> 02:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
forward when they're 16 or
 
02:54:50.030 --> 02:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
17 and the laws accommodating that and
 
02:54:52.830 --> 02:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
the law is saying we understand that so
 
02:54:55.790 --> 02:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
the whole idea of statute of limitations
 
02:54:58.429 --> 02:54:58.439 align:start position:0%
in the law is becoming less and less
 
02:55:01.510 --> 02:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
favored because it's only its true
 
02:55:04.429 --> 02:55:04.439 align:start position:0%
effect is to block people from Seeking
 
02:55:07.870 --> 02:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
Justice and I think at some level the
 
02:55:09.630 --> 02:55:09.640 align:start position:0%
documentation here I mean one of the
 
02:55:12.150 --> 02:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
effects of pasas is kidney disease I
 
02:55:14.750 --> 02:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
know a lot about kidney disease I've had
 
02:55:17.790 --> 02:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
it since birth and I've had a transplant
 
02:55:21.110 --> 02:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
so I know the developmental time of
 
02:55:23.190 --> 02:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
knowing what you have I know I had
 
02:55:25.870 --> 02:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
kidney disease how serious what it cause
 
02:55:28.990 --> 02:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
was you know I didn't know but there's
 
02:55:32.550 --> 02:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
no as the representative just said to me
 
02:55:34.110 --> 02:55:34.120 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
02:55:38.790 --> 02:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
harm in saying extend it longer this is
 
02:55:42.269 --> 02:55:42.279 align:start position:0%
complex matters new information is being
 
02:55:45.389 --> 02:55:45.399 align:start position:0%
found about causes of diseases that may
 
02:55:48.830 --> 02:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
be relevant uh and the like
 
02:55:53.870 --> 02:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
on a harm benefit analysis I just don't
 
02:55:58.510 --> 02:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
see the the harm outweighing the benefit
 
02:56:01.269 --> 02:56:01.279 align:start position:0%
of extending it but that's how I see it
 
02:56:03.670 --> 02:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative mcf far thank you Mr
 
02:56:07.590 --> 02:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker keep promoting me
 
02:56:11.630 --> 02:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr it's it's yeah sorry Mr
 
02:56:14.150 --> 02:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
chairman nevertheless
 
02:56:18.590 --> 02:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
um I uh RSA 485hp
 
02:56:21.150 --> 02:56:21.160 align:start position:0%
um the clock starts ticking at the early
 
02:56:23.309 --> 02:56:23.319 align:start position:0%
ER of when the plaintiff discovers the
 
02:56:27.269 --> 02:56:27.279 align:start position:0%
harm or in the exercise of reasonable
 
02:56:30.510 --> 02:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
diligence should have discovered it I do
 
02:56:32.349 --> 02:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
believe that stale claims undermine
 
02:56:33.950 --> 02:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
legal certainty and fairness and I
 
02:56:35.550 --> 02:56:35.560 align:start position:0%
generally support reasonable statutes
 
02:56:37.790 --> 02:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
limitations when it comes to pasas
 
02:56:39.429 --> 02:56:39.439 align:start position:0%
contamination and its long-term health
 
02:56:41.670 --> 02:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
and environmental impacts we have to
 
02:56:42.910 --> 02:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
recognize the critical difference
 
02:56:45.150 --> 02:56:45.160 align:start position:0%
between when someone should with
 
02:56:48.229 --> 02:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
reasonable diligence have known that
 
02:56:49.710 --> 02:56:49.720 align:start position:0%
their exposure could lead to damages and
 
02:56:52.070 --> 02:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
when they fully grasp the extent of
 
02:56:54.670 --> 02:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
those damages enough to take action per
 
02:56:57.030 --> 02:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
floro Aly polyflor alile substances
 
02:56:59.389 --> 02:56:59.399 align:start position:0%
contamination is a slow moving crisis
 
02:57:01.030 --> 02:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
and the health effects and environmental
 
02:57:02.830 --> 02:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
consequences may take decades to
 
02:57:05.990 --> 02:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
manifest we know that victims may only
 
02:57:07.590 --> 02:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
realize the full scope of their harm
 
02:57:10.349 --> 02:57:10.359 align:start position:0%
long after initial exposure making rigid
 
02:57:12.670 --> 02:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
time limits on the claims unfair and
 
02:57:15.389 --> 02:57:15.399 align:start position:0%
impracticable uh I would suggest that as
 
02:57:17.150 --> 02:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
we consider hb1
 
02:57:19.630 --> 02:57:19.640 align:start position:0%
199 we support ensuring that those
 
02:57:22.190 --> 02:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
harmed by the exposures have a chance to
 
02:57:24.510 --> 02:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
seek Justice while also
 
02:57:27.070 --> 02:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
maintaining that the you know this is
 
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
about balancing accountability and
 
02:57:32.950 --> 02:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
reasonableness and the purposes that we
 
02:57:35.550 --> 02:57:35.560 align:start position:0%
typically see put forward for statutes
 
02:57:38.429 --> 02:57:38.439 align:start position:0%
of limitation are not ones here I think
 
02:57:41.269 --> 02:57:41.279 align:start position:0%
to represent D bur's Point um that
 
02:57:43.070 --> 02:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
outweigh these harms I would urge my
 
02:57:44.510 --> 02:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues here to vote their conscience
 
02:57:46.150 --> 02:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
on a bipartisan
 
02:57:49.469 --> 02:57:49.479 align:start position:0%
basis anyone else wish to be heard
 
02:57:51.830 --> 02:57:51.840 align:start position:0%

03:00:25.790 --> 03:00:25.800 align:start position:0%

03:00:38.110 --> 03:00:38.120 align:start position:0%
Alexander seconded by representative kab
 
03:00:39.469 --> 03:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander do you wish to
 
03:00:41.990 --> 03:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yeah very briefly I
 
03:00:44.229 --> 03:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
really like this bill I think this bill
 
03:00:46.269 --> 03:00:46.279 align:start position:0%
is very important I think it should go I
 
03:00:49.229 --> 03:00:49.239 align:start position:0%
think it the um IA funds should go to
 
03:00:51.110 --> 03:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
cases in which the state has a
 
03:00:53.110 --> 03:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation to fund and I
 
03:00:54.469 --> 03:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
think going to the public defender
 
03:00:56.670 --> 03:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
office would be a great way to do it um
 
03:00:59.630 --> 03:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
instead of relying on um organizations
 
03:01:03.550 --> 03:01:03.560 align:start position:0%
that sometimes Lobby for um activities
 
03:01:05.550 --> 03:01:05.560 align:start position:0%
that I don't necessarily agree with um
 
03:01:07.349 --> 03:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
I'd rather it go to something that you
 
03:01:08.910 --> 03:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
know the government has a constitutional
 
03:01:10.670 --> 03:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
obligation to fund but I think we need
 
03:01:12.150 --> 03:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
to do some work on it so I'm happy to
 
03:01:14.550 --> 03:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
hold on to it and uh get it to an a to
 
03:01:15.950 --> 03:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
pass in the
 
03:01:18.389 --> 03:01:18.399 align:start position:0%
fall anyone else wish to be we heard
 
03:01:21.790 --> 03:01:21.800 align:start position:0%
representative uh Horgan um well first
 
03:01:23.229 --> 03:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
of all the bill is unnecessary the
 
03:01:25.469 --> 03:01:25.479 align:start position:0%
judicial branch is already doing
 
03:01:27.670 --> 03:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
something confidence same purposes but I
 
03:01:30.150 --> 03:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
was a little bit
 
03:01:34.349 --> 03:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
uh dumbfounded by some comments I call
 
03:01:36.510 --> 03:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
the sponsor making well he complaining
 
03:01:39.030 --> 03:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
about npos nonprofit organizations even
 
03:01:41.349 --> 03:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
call them NGS and that's kind of uh
 
03:01:42.750 --> 03:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
inconsistent what we've been hearing a
 
03:01:44.870 --> 03:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
lot how the government isn't supposed to
 
03:01:47.190 --> 03:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
be doing things we should be relying on
 
03:01:49.030 --> 03:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
charities now suddenly these Charities
 
03:01:51.670 --> 03:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
are npos somehow now suddenly they're
 
03:01:54.710 --> 03:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
nefarious too so it's almost like uh
 
03:01:56.030 --> 03:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
they don't think anybody should be
 
03:01:57.950 --> 03:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
helping U you know
 
03:02:00.389 --> 03:02:00.399 align:start position:0%
the helping the people who are helped by
 
03:02:02.190 --> 03:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
those organizations so that's kind of a
 
03:02:04.030 --> 03:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
weird thing especially he singled out uh
 
03:02:07.670 --> 03:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
well couple one organization I'm very
 
03:02:09.349 --> 03:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to and like work with a lot
 
03:02:11.150 --> 03:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
the disability rights centers he's very
 
03:02:13.469 --> 03:02:13.479 align:start position:0%
upset that they were uh you know
 
03:02:15.910 --> 03:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
apparently especially was outraged by
 
03:02:18.070 --> 03:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that they had sponsored a lot
 
03:02:19.670 --> 03:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
suit where apparently a handicap
 
03:02:21.429 --> 03:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
entrance had been blocked for some
 
03:02:22.910 --> 03:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
period of time so he thought that was
 
03:02:24.510 --> 03:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
like a really outrageous thing and that
 
03:02:26.550 --> 03:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
was like I thought I strongly support
 
03:02:29.870 --> 03:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
that organization um I haven't donated
 
03:02:32.110 --> 03:02:32.120 align:start position:0%
to disability right I've disabil to
 
03:02:34.150 --> 03:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
another disability rights I was and also
 
03:02:35.349 --> 03:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
like he's also complaining about the
 
03:02:37.190 --> 03:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
Catholic Charities because they were
 
03:02:40.229 --> 03:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
helping uh you know certain people he
 
03:02:41.469 --> 03:02:41.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't think should be in the states
 
03:02:42.830 --> 03:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
those are like just two really
 
03:02:45.309 --> 03:02:45.319 align:start position:0%
remarkable just a remarkable statements
 
03:02:47.110 --> 03:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
and you know that you know just I mean
 
03:02:48.590 --> 03:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
obviously comments people making the
 
03:02:49.830 --> 03:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
hearings don't necessarily mean the
 
03:02:51.429 --> 03:02:51.439 align:start position:0%
whole bill is a bad idea but that was
 
03:02:53.429 --> 03:02:53.439 align:start position:0%
just something I thought was really one
 
03:02:55.389 --> 03:02:55.399 align:start position:0%
of the OD one of the more interesting
 
03:02:57.630 --> 03:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
things I've heard in these hearings but
 
03:02:59.710 --> 03:02:59.720 align:start position:0%
um maybe I didn't need to bring that up
 
03:03:01.389 --> 03:03:01.399 align:start position:0%
in such detail because also just the
 
03:03:03.469 --> 03:03:03.479 align:start position:0%
bill is unnecessary anyway because there
 
03:03:05.389 --> 03:03:05.399 align:start position:0%
already is a mechanism to use those
 
03:03:07.870 --> 03:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
funds so this is and it's not
 
03:03:12.790 --> 03:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
even not even clear if uh the pr if the
 
03:03:15.349 --> 03:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
public see if the public defender office
 
03:03:18.670 --> 03:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
is even um donating to to Charities
 
03:03:21.830 --> 03:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
anyway so that's um so all right
 
03:03:24.469 --> 03:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
representative Smith uh thank you very
 
03:03:24.479 --> 03:03:25.830 align:start position:0%
representative Smith uh thank you very
much

03:03:25.830 --> 03:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
much
 
03:03:25.840 --> 03:03:27.550 align:start position:0%
much
um

03:03:27.550 --> 03:03:27.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:30.429 --> 03:03:30.439 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman I was almost going to say
 
03:03:34.429 --> 03:03:34.439 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker but I you know um that's just
 
03:03:36.750 --> 03:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
because I like to follow representative
 
03:03:40.070 --> 03:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
McFarland's lead um I find this
 
03:03:42.670 --> 03:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
discussion just
 
03:03:42.680 --> 03:03:44.910 align:start position:0%
discussion just
fascinating

03:03:44.910 --> 03:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
fascinating
 
03:03:48.830 --> 03:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
um if I for example
 
03:03:50.710 --> 03:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
were to decide that I wanted to give
 
03:03:54.389 --> 03:03:54.399 align:start position:0%
money to the Portsmith
 
03:03:54.399 --> 03:03:56.670 align:start position:0%
money to the Portsmith
Symphony

03:03:56.670 --> 03:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
Symphony
 
03:04:00.429 --> 03:04:00.439 align:start position:0%
um uh could the
 
03:04:04.910 --> 03:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
state say um well no uh we don't like
 
03:04:08.229 --> 03:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
the music that the Port Smith Symphony
 
03:04:11.469 --> 03:04:11.479 align:start position:0%
plays and so we think you've got to give
 
03:04:11.479 --> 03:04:12.830 align:start position:0%
plays and so we think you've got to give
money

03:04:12.830 --> 03:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:04:16.150 --> 03:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
to um oh I can't think of something else
 
03:04:19.469 --> 03:04:19.479 align:start position:0%
I problem but
 
03:04:22.950 --> 03:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
um and I mention that because this is
 
03:04:26.750 --> 03:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
not State money we're not talking about
 
03:04:30.510 --> 03:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
State money we're talking about money
 
03:04:33.550 --> 03:04:33.560 align:start position:0%
that belongs to private
 
03:04:36.750 --> 03:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
individuals we're talking about money
 
03:04:36.760 --> 03:04:38.550 align:start position:0%
individuals we're talking about money
where

03:04:38.550 --> 03:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:04:43.910 --> 03:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys have um uh taken some money
 
03:04:48.150 --> 03:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
from their private clients
 
03:04:52.710 --> 03:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
and um it is reason we call it Iola is
 
03:04:56.349 --> 03:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
it's interest um
 
03:05:02.550 --> 03:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
interest uh uh on lawyers trust accounts
 
03:05:06.349 --> 03:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
that's what Iola stands for it's private
 
03:05:10.590 --> 03:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
money and lawyers have this money and
 
03:05:13.030 --> 03:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's usually for a short term it's
 
03:05:17.229 --> 03:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
nickels and dimes from each lawyer and
 
03:05:21.190 --> 03:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
another number of years ago in a very
 
03:05:23.550 --> 03:05:23.560 align:start position:0%
intelligent decision in this state and
 
03:05:27.110 --> 03:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
in many others Banks
 
03:05:30.190 --> 03:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
recognized that there was really no
 
03:05:32.990 --> 03:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
point in having a separate account for
 
03:05:37.349 --> 03:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
each one of these of these uh of the the
 
03:05:41.790 --> 03:05:41.800 align:start position:0%
lawyers clients they put the money
 
03:05:45.630 --> 03:05:45.640 align:start position:0%
together and like anything else you know
 
03:05:47.870 --> 03:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
a nickel here a nickel there pretty when
 
03:05:49.910 --> 03:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
you're talking about real money but it
 
03:05:55.510 --> 03:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
is not State money it is private money
 
03:05:59.349 --> 03:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
and um the
 
03:06:01.950 --> 03:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
uh under state
 
03:06:06.590 --> 03:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
law the state is required to provide
 
03:06:11.790 --> 03:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
legal counsel in criminal matters for
 
03:06:16.070 --> 03:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
those who are obliged to go through the
 
03:06:20.910 --> 03:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
court system um the Supreme
 
03:06:26.269 --> 03:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
Court um something that I respect and I
 
03:06:28.790 --> 03:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
certainly know that at least one of us
 
03:06:32.150 --> 03:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
has actually been part of that um the
 
03:06:34.750 --> 03:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court passed a rule a
 
03:06:37.710 --> 03:06:37.720 align:start position:0%
significant number of years ago that
 
03:06:42.630 --> 03:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
said um that uh they would do what so
 
03:06:45.229 --> 03:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
many other states have done agree to
 
03:06:49.550 --> 03:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
have Iola um in this state have that
 
03:06:53.590 --> 03:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
money pulled and then make it possible
 
03:07:01.150 --> 03:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
for that money um to be used uh for
 
03:07:04.990 --> 03:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
public purposes but it's not State money
 
03:07:09.389 --> 03:07:09.399 align:start position:0%
and everybody recognizes that um if in
 
03:07:12.110 --> 03:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
fact the
 
03:07:14.309 --> 03:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
criminal uh the people involved in
 
03:07:14.319 --> 03:07:15.590 align:start position:0%
criminal uh the people involved in
criminal

03:07:15.590 --> 03:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
03:07:18.670 --> 03:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
defense um the the public
 
03:07:22.429 --> 03:07:22.439 align:start position:0%
defenders um run out of money which they
 
03:07:26.469 --> 03:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
do they have an option they can go to
 
03:07:30.269 --> 03:07:30.279 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee and ask for more
 
03:07:35.070 --> 03:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
money to meet the needs of of those
 
03:07:38.990 --> 03:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
people who are Income eligible uh for
 
03:07:41.910 --> 03:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
Public Defense in criminal matters this
 
03:07:46.150 --> 03:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
is a way to make it possible
 
03:07:51.030 --> 03:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
for people people who are in civil
 
03:07:54.110 --> 03:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
courts to get some
 
03:08:01.349 --> 03:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
benefit um it to usurp the right of the
 
03:08:05.150 --> 03:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
courts to decide for them for what will
 
03:08:09.630 --> 03:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
happen with this money um makes
 
03:08:14.309 --> 03:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely no sense in terms of um
 
03:08:19.269 --> 03:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
access to Justice and uh this
 
03:08:23.790 --> 03:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
bill does not serve the people of the
 
03:08:27.229 --> 03:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
state well and it does not respect the
 
03:08:29.830 --> 03:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
separation of powers I know the concept
 
03:08:31.710 --> 03:08:31.720 align:start position:0%
of separation of powers might be going
 
03:08:34.670 --> 03:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
out of style but I still believe in the
 
03:08:36.870 --> 03:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
separation of powers and I believe the
 
03:08:40.710 --> 03:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
courts have the right to decide what to
 
03:08:47.030 --> 03:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
do um and therefore I very very strongly
 
03:08:47.040 --> 03:08:48.070 align:start position:0%
do um and therefore I very very strongly
oppose

03:08:48.070 --> 03:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
03:08:53.150 --> 03:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
oose uh this bill and hope that we don't
 
03:08:56.630 --> 03:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
retain it um because there is nothing
 
03:09:01.269 --> 03:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
that we could do um to meet our
 
03:09:03.790 --> 03:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligations if we retain
 
03:09:07.110 --> 03:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
it and therefore I strongly
 
03:09:10.990 --> 03:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
oppose um retention as I would strongly
 
03:09:14.870 --> 03:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
oppose OTP right other anyone else wish
 
03:09:17.670 --> 03:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
should be heard representative Bur
 
03:09:20.990 --> 03:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair or Mr Speaker the
 
03:09:24.990 --> 03:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
case may be um I have a little poker
 
03:09:27.830 --> 03:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
game that I play Friday night Joe's in
 
03:09:31.670 --> 03:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
it and bunch of friends and we agree
 
03:09:31.680 --> 03:09:33.349 align:start position:0%
it and bunch of friends and we agree
that

03:09:33.349 --> 03:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:09:38.830 --> 03:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
um at for each pot we put aside 10% to
 
03:09:41.429 --> 03:09:41.439 align:start position:0%
uh donate to charity and Joe and I dis
 
03:09:43.870 --> 03:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
agree sometimes on the Charities but we
 
03:09:48.110 --> 03:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
do it and we enjoy doing that um I would
 
03:09:49.229 --> 03:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
be very
 
03:09:52.389 --> 03:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
forlorn if the New Hampshire legislature
 
03:09:56.950 --> 03:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
came in and said grabbed our little pot
 
03:10:00.790 --> 03:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
of charitable money and said uh we
 
03:10:03.429 --> 03:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
decide we want to use it to to refurbish
 
03:10:05.309 --> 03:10:05.319 align:start position:0%
the chairs in rep's
 
03:10:08.870 --> 03:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
Hall and I would say you know that's
 
03:10:10.710 --> 03:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
nice State of New Hampshire but that's
 
03:10:13.990 --> 03:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
not your money and to the extent that I
 
03:10:16.630 --> 03:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
hear from time to time that taxation is
 
03:10:19.910 --> 03:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
theft you know it seems to me that if
 
03:10:22.830 --> 03:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
you want a prime example of the state
 
03:10:24.550 --> 03:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
picking the pockets of private
 
03:10:26.910 --> 03:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
individuals and their money that this
 
03:10:30.110 --> 03:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
bill may represent that so I'm on the
 
03:10:32.309 --> 03:10:32.319 align:start position:0%
fence about voting to retain because I
 
03:10:37.710 --> 03:10:37.720 align:start position:0%
hear what uh the eminent wisdom of uh
 
03:10:40.910 --> 03:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative Smith so I'll figure that
 
03:10:42.990 --> 03:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
out in the next few minutes thank you
 
03:10:45.469 --> 03:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
all right um representative
 
03:10:49.309 --> 03:10:49.319 align:start position:0%
mcfar thank you Mr chair chman um it's
 
03:10:51.990 --> 03:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
been a long weekend and I have nothing
 
03:10:53.950 --> 03:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
Jermaine to say on this except to say
 
03:10:55.469 --> 03:10:55.479 align:start position:0%
that I wholeheartedly support everything
 
03:10:56.910 --> 03:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander said but I just
 
03:10:58.710 --> 03:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to take the opportunity to say
 
03:11:00.550 --> 03:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
the word chairman another few times Mr
 
03:11:02.910 --> 03:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
chairman so thank you thank you all
 
03:11:05.309 --> 03:11:05.319 align:start position:0%
right uh representative Manos thank you
 
03:11:07.950 --> 03:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um one of the things we heard
 
03:11:11.269 --> 03:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
testimony about was um I believe it's
 
03:11:15.429 --> 03:11:15.439 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court rule 50 which um gives us
 
03:11:17.830 --> 03:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
the ability to
 
03:11:20.830 --> 03:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
um petition the Supreme Court or meet
 
03:11:22.870 --> 03:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
with the rules committee or however it's
 
03:11:25.670 --> 03:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
done internally I don't know um but to
 
03:11:29.110 --> 03:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
Advocate there's a process under rule 50
 
03:11:31.630 --> 03:11:31.640 align:start position:0%
to advocate for what the division of the
 
03:11:33.750 --> 03:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
the iila money should be and how it
 
03:11:35.710 --> 03:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
should be allocated and how it should be
 
03:11:39.389 --> 03:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
spent and so I would urge us to defeat
 
03:11:42.790 --> 03:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
um the motion to retain I oppose the
 
03:11:47.269 --> 03:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
bill um because there's a perfectly um
 
03:11:50.429 --> 03:11:50.439 align:start position:0%
there's a perfectly available method to
 
03:11:53.630 --> 03:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
address the division of how the iala
 
03:11:57.070 --> 03:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
money is allocated and spent and I think
 
03:11:59.030 --> 03:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
that that's the appropriate method for
 
03:12:01.790 --> 03:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
moving ahead and I don't think that this
 
03:12:04.429 --> 03:12:04.439 align:start position:0%
is it all right so I would oppose
 
03:12:08.510 --> 03:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
retention and oppose the bill hang on
 
03:12:10.750 --> 03:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
hang on represent yes representative
 
03:12:12.670 --> 03:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
it's been brought to my attention I
 
03:12:15.269 --> 03:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
referred to representative Alexander as
 
03:12:18.790 --> 03:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
Joe and uh only because in real life
 
03:12:21.349 --> 03:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
that's what I call him so I I do tender
 
03:12:24.070 --> 03:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
my apology for referring to my friend
 
03:12:26.710 --> 03:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
from across the aisle in that such an
 
03:12:28.630 --> 03:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
informal manner all right representative
 
03:12:32.229 --> 03:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
Oregon um yes I wanted to I I commented
 
03:12:34.790 --> 03:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
earlier on um well Roman numeral 2 in
 
03:12:37.750 --> 03:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
section two that so there's no we didn't
 
03:12:39.750 --> 03:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
get information about what nonprofit
 
03:12:42.469 --> 03:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
organizations the uh public defenders
 
03:12:45.110 --> 03:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
office is actually uh actually
 
03:12:46.670 --> 03:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
contributing to although I think he did
 
03:12:46.680 --> 03:12:47.910 align:start position:0%
contributing to although I think he did
cite

03:12:47.910 --> 03:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
cite
 
03:12:49.550 --> 03:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
three specific organizations whose
 
03:12:52.150 --> 03:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
activities he objected to at least two
 
03:12:53.429 --> 03:12:53.439 align:start position:0%
actually all three of which I was kind
 
03:12:55.830 --> 03:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
of dumbfounded that anybody would find
 
03:12:57.670 --> 03:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
them objectionable but that's just my
 
03:12:59.630 --> 03:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
opinion but there's there's no data
 
03:13:01.190 --> 03:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
about what nonprofits they're
 
03:13:03.870 --> 03:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
contributing funding to I would not be
 
03:13:05.190 --> 03:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
surprised to learned there aren't any
 
03:13:07.550 --> 03:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
and also the public defenders office
 
03:13:10.670 --> 03:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
certainly I've seen Defenders looking at
 
03:13:12.670 --> 03:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance finings I've never seen
 
03:13:14.550 --> 03:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
the public defender office contributing
 
03:13:16.630 --> 03:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
any political campaign in fact I think
 
03:13:19.349 --> 03:13:19.359 align:start position:0%
probably would be certainly questionable
 
03:13:20.910 --> 03:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
if they did so and it be probably be
 
03:13:22.870 --> 03:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
illegal but there's I definitely know
 
03:13:24.349 --> 03:13:24.359 align:start position:0%
there's no evidence that the public
 
03:13:26.429 --> 03:13:26.439 align:start position:0%
defenders office is in fact contributing
 
03:13:28.990 --> 03:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
to political campaigns um and I can't
 
03:13:32.309 --> 03:13:32.319 align:start position:0%
imagine I'd be astounded if they were so
 
03:13:34.990 --> 03:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
um so the problem that's trying to be
 
03:13:36.590 --> 03:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
solved at least by that subar of the
 
03:13:38.910 --> 03:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
ball as far as it tell non-existence I'm
 
03:13:40.790 --> 03:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
not sure what the retained Bill process
 
03:13:42.910 --> 03:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
might or might not be a good I'm not
 
03:13:44.950 --> 03:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
sure not sure whether having a retained
 
03:13:46.630 --> 03:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
Bill process to deal with a problem
 
03:13:48.750 --> 03:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
that's obviously non almost certainly
 
03:13:50.550 --> 03:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
non-existent I'm not sure if that's
 
03:13:52.429 --> 03:13:52.439 align:start position:0%
really a worthwhile use of our time even
 
03:13:55.110 --> 03:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
though I just earlier today proposed
 
03:13:57.830 --> 03:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
retain Bill process on another bill so
 
03:13:59.389 --> 03:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
all right thanks all right anyone else
 
03:14:01.550 --> 03:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
wish to be heard so I just what the only
 
03:14:03.750 --> 03:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
comment I would make is I I think that
 
03:14:05.830 --> 03:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
with respect to the respectfully with
 
03:14:07.590 --> 03:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
respect to both representative Smith's
 
03:14:09.110 --> 03:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
comments and representative burch's
 
03:14:11.990 --> 03:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
comments the the the problem here I
 
03:14:14.990 --> 03:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
agree completely that this money is
 
03:14:18.710 --> 03:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
private money it belongs to the clients
 
03:14:22.030 --> 03:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
and what happens now under Iola is the
 
03:14:24.790 --> 03:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court directs clients don't get
 
03:14:27.590 --> 03:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
a choice the money goes into these trust
 
03:14:30.269 --> 03:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
accounts and it goes where the Supreme
 
03:14:35.870 --> 03:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
Court says it's okay for it to go um I I
 
03:14:38.510 --> 03:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
disagree with the with this bill in the
 
03:14:41.309 --> 03:14:41.319 align:start position:0%
sense that it would say basically it
 
03:14:44.349 --> 03:14:44.359 align:start position:0%
would say instead of the Supreme Court
 
03:14:47.110 --> 03:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
appropriating the money to its fa
 
03:14:51.630 --> 03:14:51.640 align:start position:0%
favored places we will appropriate it to
 
03:14:54.790 --> 03:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
our favored places either the the the uh
 
03:14:57.349 --> 03:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
public defender or the general fund what
 
03:15:00.190 --> 03:15:00.200 align:start position:0%
really ought to happen is there this
 
03:15:03.309 --> 03:15:03.319 align:start position:0%
money ought to go back to the clients
 
03:15:06.790 --> 03:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
and I went and looked briefly I I looked
 
03:15:08.790 --> 03:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh went back to the there there are two
 
03:15:11.510 --> 03:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
supreme US Supreme Court cases on this
 
03:15:14.990 --> 03:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
the first one held that there was that
 
03:15:17.830 --> 03:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
that what was done here was a taking and
 
03:15:19.349 --> 03:15:19.359 align:start position:0%
then there was a later case that said
 
03:15:21.469 --> 03:15:21.479 align:start position:0%
well no it's it can be for a public
 
03:15:23.990 --> 03:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
purpose both of those were five to four
 
03:15:26.309 --> 03:15:26.319 align:start position:0%
decisions I have very little doubt that
 
03:15:28.229 --> 03:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
if this issue got to the Supreme Court
 
03:15:31.229 --> 03:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
today they the the decision that upheld
 
03:15:33.429 --> 03:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
this as not being a taking would be
 
03:15:36.070 --> 03:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
reversed I feel very strongly about that
 
03:15:40.229 --> 03:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
because one of the big one of the big
 
03:15:42.790 --> 03:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
arguments that was made back then 30
 
03:15:45.710 --> 03:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
years ago whatever was F there were two
 
03:15:47.550 --> 03:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
arguments made in support of this first
 
03:15:49.469 --> 03:15:49.479 align:start position:0%
that the money was generally small each
 
03:15:51.990 --> 03:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
client was a very small amount of money
 
03:15:56.349 --> 03:15:56.359 align:start position:0%
number one but number two that um it was
 
03:15:59.870 --> 03:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to to decide to determine at
 
03:16:02.429 --> 03:16:02.439 align:start position:0%
that time how much money was actually
 
03:16:05.389 --> 03:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
due to each client and so that was the
 
03:16:07.469 --> 03:16:07.479 align:start position:0%
other rationale for why well it's going
 
03:16:10.469 --> 03:16:10.479 align:start position:0%
to be really hard to figure this out I I
 
03:16:12.830 --> 03:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
suspect and that's why I think retention
 
03:16:15.469 --> 03:16:15.479 align:start position:0%
is a good idea so we can find this out I
 
03:16:17.429 --> 03:16:17.439 align:start position:0%
suspect that with today
 
03:16:19.910 --> 03:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
technology that would not be a hurdle at
 
03:16:23.110 --> 03:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
all that that Banks could very easily uh
 
03:16:24.790 --> 03:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
come up with a system that would say
 
03:16:28.550 --> 03:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
Okay client a had the had you know
 
03:16:32.830 --> 03:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
$10,000 in this account for 12 days
 
03:16:35.870 --> 03:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh whatever uh and here's the amount of
 
03:16:37.510 --> 03:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
Interest so I think that that it would
 
03:16:39.990 --> 03:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
be very easy to determine what that is
 
03:16:43.750 --> 03:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
and I think what if if we find out in
 
03:16:45.429 --> 03:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
through through the retention process
 
03:16:47.630 --> 03:16:47.640 align:start position:0%
that that is in fact the case
 
03:16:49.670 --> 03:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
then I think it would be appropriate to
 
03:16:53.950 --> 03:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
say this money belongs to the client the
 
03:16:56.670 --> 03:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
um it it it doesn't go to it doesn't go
 
03:16:58.750 --> 03:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
to the court it doesn't go to the bar
 
03:17:01.030 --> 03:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
Foundation it goes back to the client
 
03:17:03.469 --> 03:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
and if it's only uh you know and if the
 
03:17:06.189 --> 03:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
client I suppose if the clients wanted
 
03:17:08.670 --> 03:17:08.680 align:start position:0%
to execute wanted to consent to have the
 
03:17:10.469 --> 03:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
money go to the bar Foundation great
 
03:17:11.790 --> 03:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's that's their
 
03:17:14.110 --> 03:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
decision but it shouldn't be that that
 
03:17:16.389 --> 03:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
it's just appropriated in the way it's
 
03:17:18.750 --> 03:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
appropriated now so for those reasons I
 
03:17:20.670 --> 03:17:20.680 align:start position:0%
support the retention and I hope we'll
 
03:17:24.550 --> 03:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
find out what the real situation is um
 
03:17:27.510 --> 03:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard seeing none
 
03:17:29.950 --> 03:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
i' would ask the uh clerk to call the
 
03:17:36.870 --> 03:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:41.229 --> 03:17:41.239 align:start position:0%

yes 16 Ys two Nays
 
03:18:46.150 --> 03:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
to Mr chair I'd like to explain my vote
 
03:18:47.950 --> 03:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
Yes of course
 
03:18:53.790 --> 03:18:53.800 align:start position:0%
um I very strongly oppose this bill um
 
03:18:53.800 --> 03:18:55.630 align:start position:0%
um I very strongly oppose this bill um
but

03:18:55.630 --> 03:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:18:58.870 --> 03:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I can do is count
 
03:19:01.670 --> 03:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
and as soon as it was clear to me that
 
03:19:05.429 --> 03:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
there would be enough votes to retain um
 
03:19:08.389 --> 03:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
and that anything else would not be in
 
03:19:12.429 --> 03:19:12.439 align:start position:0%
the majority um I voted to retain
 
03:19:15.630 --> 03:19:15.640 align:start position:0%
because if there is a way to use this as
 
03:19:21.429 --> 03:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
a vehicle to improve the way we meet the
 
03:19:26.990 --> 03:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
needs of indigen clients um who
 
03:19:30.950 --> 03:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
um are involved in civil or criminal
 
03:19:32.910 --> 03:19:32.920 align:start position:0%
matters then I want to be part of that
 
03:19:36.950 --> 03:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
process all right all right um so uh
 
03:19:41.229 --> 03:19:41.239 align:start position:0%
16-2 um uh can this go on consent or it
 
03:19:43.389 --> 03:19:43.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't go on it's retained oh I'm sorry
 
03:19:44.790 --> 03:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's retained that's no I'm sorry you're
 
03:19:47.269 --> 03:19:47.279 align:start position:0%
right you're right and no report report
 
03:19:49.710 --> 03:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
okay no sorry about that all right all
 
03:19:49.720 --> 03:19:53.830 align:start position:0%
okay no sorry about that all right all
right

03:19:53.830 --> 03:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:57.830 --> 03:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
so um all right
 
03:20:02.550 --> 03:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
um we've done that let's retain um all
 
03:20:07.110 --> 03:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
right uh let me turn to
 
03:20:10.750 --> 03:20:10.760 align:start position:0%

03:21:25.600 --> 03:21:26.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:21:26.710 --> 03:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:21:29.150 --> 03:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
um all right so do you want to speak to
 
03:21:32.030 --> 03:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
your uh Amendment yes yes thank you Mr
 
03:21:34.830 --> 03:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
chair so my amendment is very simple um
 
03:21:37.070 --> 03:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony this is about land
 
03:21:41.550 --> 03:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
and tax appeals um and the concern is
 
03:21:43.590 --> 03:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
that the statute as it currently is
 
03:21:47.110 --> 03:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
written provides that um here ings will
 
03:21:49.710 --> 03:21:49.720 align:start position:0%
be held in the county where the land is
 
03:21:54.550 --> 03:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
located and um the board is not able to
 
03:21:56.950 --> 03:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
frequently not always but frequently is
 
03:21:59.510 --> 03:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
not able to find space in the uh
 
03:22:02.910 --> 03:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
relevant County so this uh Amendment
 
03:22:06.110 --> 03:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
would simply say that the hearings would
 
03:22:10.070 --> 03:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
continue to be in the county um unless
 
03:22:12.469 --> 03:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
um there isn't unless the board
 
03:22:14.309 --> 03:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
determines that there isn't space in the
 
03:22:16.110 --> 03:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
county isn't available space in the
 
03:22:16.120 --> 03:22:17.229 align:start position:0%
county isn't available space in the
county

03:22:17.229 --> 03:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
county
 
03:22:19.389 --> 03:22:19.399 align:start position:0%
and then it would be held at the board's
 
03:22:22.590 --> 03:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
hearing room and conquered so um I think
 
03:22:24.309 --> 03:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
it's pretty straightforward
 
03:22:27.349 --> 03:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I would ask for the
 
03:22:30.670 --> 03:22:30.680 align:start position:0%
committee to adopt it and then pass otpa
 
03:22:32.110 --> 03:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
right anyone else wish to be heard on
 
03:22:33.830 --> 03:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
this I have to say I think it's a good
 
03:22:35.110 --> 03:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
amendment I think it makes a lot of
 
03:22:37.630 --> 03:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
sense and it cover it captures the
 
03:22:39.950 --> 03:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
things you were concerned about um all
 
03:22:42.469 --> 03:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
right anyone else wish to be anyone else
 
03:22:44.309 --> 03:22:44.319 align:start position:0%

03:22:58.070 --> 03:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
like it's probably not controversial can
 
03:23:00.550 --> 03:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
I ask uh for a show of hands all those
 
03:23:03.150 --> 03:23:03.160 align:start position:0%

03:27:05.870 --> 03:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
kab you wish to speak to your motion
 
03:27:07.389 --> 03:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
very briefly I think that this is a
 
03:27:10.670 --> 03:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
really important bill for protecting
 
03:27:12.790 --> 03:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
kiddos from this I think Parents try
 
03:27:14.189 --> 03:27:14.199 align:start position:0%
their best
 
03:27:16.750 --> 03:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
but with technology it can really
 
03:27:18.630 --> 03:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
difficult and I think if we can kind of
 
03:27:20.630 --> 03:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
clear up some of the language on this it
 
03:27:23.189 --> 03:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
it could be a really good bill all right
 
03:27:24.790 --> 03:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to yes representative
 
03:27:27.510 --> 03:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
pet yes thank you we've gone back and
 
03:27:29.349 --> 03:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
forth quite a bit even within our own
 
03:27:31.389 --> 03:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
caucus about this bill and I just want
 
03:27:35.269 --> 03:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
to draw attention to the fact that um a
 
03:27:38.110 --> 03:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
very small organization managed to
 
03:27:42.229 --> 03:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
accumulate 174 signatures um in a very
 
03:27:44.630 --> 03:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
short amount of time I think it was from
 
03:27:47.429 --> 03:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
4:00 the afternoon before hearing to
 
03:27:49.189 --> 03:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
when we had the hearing and I think that
 
03:27:51.229 --> 03:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
just demonstrates how important this is
 
03:27:54.429 --> 03:27:54.439 align:start position:0%
to parents and families that we do
 
03:27:56.309 --> 03:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
something to try to protect their
 
03:27:59.070 --> 03:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
children from um pornography and
 
03:28:02.510 --> 03:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
obscenity that they have access to
 
03:28:05.469 --> 03:28:05.479 align:start position:0%
online right anyone else wish to be
 
03:28:08.710 --> 03:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
heard only oh I'm sorry representative
 
03:28:12.670 --> 03:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
bur just to say briefly if we do retain
 
03:28:14.750 --> 03:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
I hope we pay some attention to the
 
03:28:17.910 --> 03:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
concern that the New Hampshire library
 
03:28:20.469 --> 03:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
trustees Association brought up about
 
03:28:23.910 --> 03:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
how this would impact uh the ability of
 
03:28:27.590 --> 03:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
libraries that hand out tablets to uh
 
03:28:30.429 --> 03:28:30.439 align:start position:0%
adults and children coming in and what
 
03:28:32.910 --> 03:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
they would have to do to change their
 
03:28:34.750 --> 03:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
technology and whe they can afford to do
 
03:28:36.870 --> 03:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
so in the like I just hope that's paid
 
03:28:40.630 --> 03:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
attention to yes representative kab um I
 
03:28:43.469 --> 03:28:43.479 align:start position:0%
would be honored to chair this committee
 
03:28:45.110 --> 03:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
if you're willing to have me and I would
 
03:28:48.510 --> 03:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
love to have you on the subcommittee rep
 
03:28:50.710 --> 03:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
Birch to kind of to to address that that
 
03:28:51.990 --> 03:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
concern I think that's something that we
 
03:28:54.389 --> 03:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
could definitely find a way to address
 
03:28:56.469 --> 03:28:56.479 align:start position:0%
all right so uh the suggestion is to
 
03:28:59.150 --> 03:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
form a subcommittee um representative
 
03:29:03.269 --> 03:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:06.269 --> 03:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
some oh no no no I right I no I
 
03:29:11.269 --> 03:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
understand I'm just U um all right um so
 
03:29:14.110 --> 03:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
on the question of of the the motion to
 
03:29:15.910 --> 03:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
retain anyone else wish to be heard on
 
03:29:15.920 --> 03:29:17.110 align:start position:0%
retain anyone else wish to be heard on
that

03:29:17.110 --> 03:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:29:17.120 --> 03:29:18.150 align:start position:0%
that
well

03:29:18.150 --> 03:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:29:20.790 --> 03:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
justes yes I'm just I'm just a little
 
03:29:22.670 --> 03:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
confused when it says the bill requires
 
03:29:25.349 --> 03:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of electronic tablets to
 
03:29:26.790 --> 03:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
me that
 
03:29:29.630 --> 03:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
sounds interesting like that could be
 
03:29:32.670 --> 03:29:32.680 align:start position:0%
difficult when we order laptops like I'm
 
03:29:34.510 --> 03:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
on the board of a school district and
 
03:29:36.830 --> 03:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
that's what we do we give our students
 
03:29:38.830 --> 03:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
that or and their families could I just
 
03:29:40.070 --> 03:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
ask you get a little closer to the my
 
03:29:41.309 --> 03:29:41.319 align:start position:0%
I'm having trouble hearing you
 
03:29:44.030 --> 03:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative iot it was over here so
 
03:29:47.150 --> 03:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
at this point um I'm not I'm I'm very
 
03:29:49.229 --> 03:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
confused by the first sentence is what
 
03:29:51.870 --> 03:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
I'm saying because the manufacturer
 
03:29:54.349 --> 03:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
like what's that just the manufacturer
 
03:29:57.469 --> 03:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
of my laptop like Lenovo or and I asked
 
03:29:59.630 --> 03:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
and then we asked them to do it before
 
03:30:01.389 --> 03:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's the idea yeah just to
 
03:30:04.189 --> 03:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
require manufacturers to have to have
 
03:30:06.630 --> 03:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
those things representative H um I just
 
03:30:11.710 --> 03:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
want to point out that it's uh strictly
 
03:30:14.429 --> 03:30:14.439 align:start position:0%
strictly limited to filtering out uh
 
03:30:16.670 --> 03:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
sexual material so there's nothing in
 
03:30:20.429 --> 03:30:20.439 align:start position:0%
there about uh gu nothing in there about
 
03:30:22.309 --> 03:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh violence nothing in there about hate
 
03:30:24.990 --> 03:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
speech nothing against a number of other
 
03:30:27.590 --> 03:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
subject areas that like uh parents may
 
03:30:29.870 --> 03:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
have qualms about experiencing their
 
03:30:31.950 --> 03:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
children too so strictly you know it's
 
03:30:34.389 --> 03:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
about nothing but uh it's about nothing
 
03:30:37.710 --> 03:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
but sexual materials it doesn't it um
 
03:30:39.469 --> 03:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover the full gamut of a
 
03:30:42.590 --> 03:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
potentially objectionable material that
 
03:30:43.710 --> 03:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
uh you might want to protect your
 
03:30:47.150 --> 03:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
children from but um
 
03:30:50.189 --> 03:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else um wish yes
 
03:30:52.110 --> 03:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
representative I guess I'm looking at
 
03:30:54.229 --> 03:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
this to prevent minors from accessing
 
03:30:56.030 --> 03:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
obscene material are we supposed to
 
03:30:56.040 --> 03:30:57.269 align:start position:0%
obscene material are we supposed to
Define

03:30:57.269 --> 03:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
Define
 
03:31:00.870 --> 03:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
that the it's the definition of obscene
 
03:31:03.189 --> 03:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
I think is in the
 
03:31:08.469 --> 03:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
bill um Mr chairman I if um a member of
 
03:31:10.229 --> 03:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
this committee has concerns about the
 
03:31:12.510 --> 03:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
language of the bill might it be
 
03:31:14.910 --> 03:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate then to vote to retain the
 
03:31:18.429 --> 03:31:18.439 align:start position:0%
bill no that's I think that's that's no
 
03:31:21.030 --> 03:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
I think that's exactly right I I I think
 
03:31:26.150 --> 03:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
I should say um um I I speaking
 
03:31:27.950 --> 03:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
personally I am
 
03:31:31.309 --> 03:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
personally inclined to support something
 
03:31:35.750 --> 03:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
like this bill I I had uh two concerns
 
03:31:39.389 --> 03:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
one is I I I did have a concern about
 
03:31:41.750 --> 03:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
the private cause of action and
 
03:31:44.150 --> 03:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
particularly the private cause of action
 
03:31:48.469 --> 03:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
part that set a 50 ,000 uh civil penalty
 
03:31:51.790 --> 03:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
basically I'm I am concerned about that
 
03:31:55.469 --> 03:31:55.479 align:start position:0%
um but you know if if everything else
 
03:31:57.750 --> 03:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
was was okay I might be able to get over
 
03:31:58.750 --> 03:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
that but the other thing that I'm
 
03:32:01.950 --> 03:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
concerned about I would say candidly um
 
03:32:04.710 --> 03:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
from a discussion the people on my side
 
03:32:06.189 --> 03:32:06.199 align:start position:0%
of the aisle had last evening and in
 
03:32:08.189 --> 03:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
particular rep comments that were made
 
03:32:12.429 --> 03:32:12.439 align:start position:0%
by uh um representative McFarland
 
03:32:15.070 --> 03:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
who appears to have a fair amount of
 
03:32:18.349 --> 03:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
knowledge in this area um that seemed to
 
03:32:21.349 --> 03:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
gel with some with a call I got from a
 
03:32:24.070 --> 03:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
lobbyist representing the IND industry
 
03:32:28.670 --> 03:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
suggesting that um there's there is
 
03:32:32.269 --> 03:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
there are some real concerns about the
 
03:32:35.150 --> 03:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
details of how this would actually work
 
03:32:39.110 --> 03:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
and so given that um I think it does
 
03:32:41.870 --> 03:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
make sense to retain this so that we can
 
03:32:44.389 --> 03:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
I mean my view would be so that we can
 
03:32:47.510 --> 03:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
have a a sub committee look at this and
 
03:32:51.590 --> 03:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
come back with um a proposal with May
 
03:32:53.389 --> 03:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps suggested changes or whatever
 
03:32:55.710 --> 03:32:55.720 align:start position:0%
that would make um that would make us
 
03:32:57.710 --> 03:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
all more comfortable to be able or at
 
03:33:00.630 --> 03:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
least all of us hopefully all of us but
 
03:33:02.189 --> 03:33:02.199 align:start position:0%
at least all of us on my side of the
 
03:33:04.469 --> 03:33:04.479 align:start position:0%
aisle be more comfortable with voting
 
03:33:07.189 --> 03:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
for this um so for that reason I think
 
03:33:09.229 --> 03:33:09.239 align:start position:0%
the retain is a is a good idea and I
 
03:33:13.429 --> 03:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
intend to support it um anything anyone
 
03:33:16.030 --> 03:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
anyone else have any comments all right
 
03:33:18.590 --> 03:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none then I would the motion is
 
03:33:21.590 --> 03:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh to retain House Bill
 
03:33:24.150 --> 03:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
293 and um I would ask the clerk to
 
03:33:26.670 --> 03:33:26.680 align:start position:0%
please call the role Vice chairman
 
03:33:26.680 --> 03:33:29.870 align:start position:0%

03:54:54.070 --> 03:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll speak to both the bill
 
03:54:57.910 --> 03:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
and the amendment so well it's it's kind
 
03:54:59.469 --> 03:54:59.479 align:start position:0%
of all the same it doesn't really it
 
03:55:02.349 --> 03:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't really it still has the same
 
03:55:05.990 --> 03:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
purpose the same statement of intent um
 
03:55:07.630 --> 03:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
it provides that healthc care providers
 
03:55:10.750 --> 03:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
have a right to conscientiously object
 
03:55:15.550 --> 03:55:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:17.790 --> 03:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
in providing abortion or sterilization
 
03:55:19.830 --> 03:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
procedures the amendment
 
03:55:22.110 --> 03:55:22.120 align:start position:0%
removes um the part about
 
03:55:25.110 --> 03:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
conscientiously objecting to artificial
 
03:55:28.710 --> 03:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
um birth control um the bill requires
 
03:55:30.429 --> 03:55:30.439 align:start position:0%
Healthcare institutions to prominently
 
03:55:32.990 --> 03:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
post an employee notice establishes
 
03:55:34.910 --> 03:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
civil remedies including
 
03:55:39.750 --> 03:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
fines um so what this amendment does um
 
03:55:42.070 --> 03:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
it actually updates the definition of
 
03:55:44.030 --> 03:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
abortion because that wasn't consistent
 
03:55:49.189 --> 03:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
with um what's current law in RSA
 
03:55:52.070 --> 03:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
32943 um because it was calling an
 
03:55:55.269 --> 03:55:55.279 align:start position:0%
ectopic the original the bill itself not
 
03:55:56.990 --> 03:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment was referring to an
 
03:56:01.189 --> 03:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
ectopic pregnancy um removing an ectopic
 
03:56:04.429 --> 03:56:04.439 align:start position:0%
pregnancy as an abortion which is not um
 
03:56:05.630 --> 03:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
so then
 
03:56:09.389 --> 03:56:09.399 align:start position:0%
anywhere that it reference so let's see
 
03:56:12.590 --> 03:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
line 17 through 19 from the original
 
03:56:14.790 --> 03:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
bill was removed because that's
 
03:56:18.510 --> 03:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
artificial contraception or
 
03:56:23.429 --> 03:56:23.439 align:start position:0%
contraception and then sorry
 
03:56:25.870 --> 03:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
um in line
 
03:56:29.389 --> 03:56:29.399 align:start position:0%
26 of the on page two of the original
 
03:56:31.550 --> 03:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
bill it removes or the prescription or
 
03:56:34.309 --> 03:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
provision of artificial
 
03:56:37.910 --> 03:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
contraception uh line 28 it removes or
 
03:56:39.349 --> 03:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
the prescription or provision of
 
03:56:39.359 --> 03:56:40.990 align:start position:0%
the prescription or provision of
artificial

03:56:40.990 --> 03:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
artificial
 
03:56:41.000 --> 03:56:43.030 align:start position:0%
artificial
contraception

03:56:43.030 --> 03:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
contraception
 
03:56:47.550 --> 03:56:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:47.560 --> 03:56:52.389 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

03:56:52.389 --> 03:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:55.389 --> 03:56:55.399 align:start position:0%
section four is
 
03:56:59.910 --> 03:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
added after line 35 on page two which
 
03:57:01.349 --> 03:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
was the amendment that representative
 
03:57:04.070 --> 03:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
Pearson brought in which says that this
 
03:57:06.030 --> 03:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
section shall not apply to a health care
 
03:57:07.870 --> 03:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
provider employed by a healthc care
 
03:57:10.189 --> 03:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
institution that provides abortion or
 
03:57:12.590 --> 03:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
sterilization Services as a major part
 
03:57:14.830 --> 03:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
of its services
 
03:57:16.870 --> 03:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
nor shall this section apply to a health
 
03:57:18.790 --> 03:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
care provider who is the only health
 
03:57:20.790 --> 03:57:20.800 align:start position:0%
care provider present in an emergency
 
03:57:23.149 --> 03:57:23.159 align:start position:0%
situation so there was concern that
 
03:57:26.630 --> 03:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody might want to go work at
 
03:57:29.830 --> 03:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
a facility that only performs that's
 
03:57:32.469 --> 03:57:32.479 align:start position:0%
primarily performs abortions and wanted
 
03:57:35.070 --> 03:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
to exercise their right of conscience
 
03:57:36.510 --> 03:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
and that would be against the purposes
 
03:57:38.510 --> 03:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
of that type of a
 
03:57:41.870 --> 03:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
facility um other than that the bill is
 
03:57:45.990 --> 03:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
fundamentally the same and
 
03:57:49.269 --> 03:57:49.279 align:start position:0%
if yeah all right anyone else wish to be
 
03:57:54.110 --> 03:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
heard on uh the amendment uh to HB uh
 
03:57:54.120 --> 03:57:56.790 align:start position:0%
heard on uh the amendment uh to HB uh
232

03:57:56.790 --> 03:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
232
 
03:57:59.710 --> 03:57:59.720 align:start position:0%
FN yes representative far I only need to
 
03:58:01.710 --> 03:58:01.720 align:start position:0%
ask Mr chairman I I was under the
 
03:58:03.710 --> 03:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
impression that this amendment was going
 
03:58:05.630 --> 03:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
to um
 
03:58:09.110 --> 03:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
remove the uh paragraph about artificial
 
03:58:10.389 --> 03:58:10.399 align:start position:0%
contraception or
 
03:58:12.670 --> 03:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
contraception um and make a couple of
 
03:58:14.870 --> 03:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
others minor changes but it seems to
 
03:58:17.189 --> 03:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
have changed other elements of the
 
03:58:19.189 --> 03:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
language as well for example abortion
 
03:58:21.349 --> 03:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
has been
 
03:58:23.229 --> 03:58:23.239 align:start position:0%
redefined I mentioned that at the
 
03:58:26.550 --> 03:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
beginning yes it did it the definition
 
03:58:29.389 --> 03:58:29.399 align:start position:0%
of abort abortion has been changed to be
 
03:58:32.950 --> 03:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
consistent with 329 colon 43 which is
 
03:58:35.710 --> 03:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
our fetal Life protection
 
03:58:40.070 --> 03:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
act are there any other comments oh yes
 
03:58:41.670 --> 03:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
representative Rambo thank you I also
 
03:58:43.229 --> 03:58:43.239 align:start position:0%
had a note that I had understood an
 
03:58:44.790 --> 03:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
amendment was going to address the
 
03:58:46.750 --> 03:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
concern about uh a receptionist for
 
03:58:48.630 --> 03:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
instance be able to turn somebody away
 
03:58:51.269 --> 03:58:51.279 align:start position:0%
without without um explanation for
 
03:58:53.269 --> 03:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
appointment or providing referral but to
 
03:58:55.389 --> 03:58:55.399 align:start position:0%
be clear since we just got this that
 
03:58:57.269 --> 03:58:57.279 align:start position:0%
provision has not been amended or
 
03:58:59.349 --> 03:58:59.359 align:start position:0%

04:00:48.910 --> 04:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
representative oh I'm sorry
 
04:00:51.030 --> 04:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative RBA going to defer to
 
04:00:54.990 --> 04:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
representative Manos first oh all
 
04:00:58.349 --> 04:00:58.359 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chair I I strongly
 
04:01:01.469 --> 04:01:01.479 align:start position:0%
strongly strongly oppose this bill um we
 
04:01:05.110 --> 04:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
all recognize the right of um religious
 
04:01:07.389 --> 04:01:07.399 align:start position:0%
freedom uh both under our Federal
 
04:01:09.910 --> 04:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution and our state constitution
 
04:01:12.750 --> 04:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
and we all respect that however this
 
04:01:14.630 --> 04:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
04:01:18.469 --> 04:01:18.479 align:start position:0%
deny services to people who have other
 
04:01:21.870 --> 04:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
religious points of view there is no
 
04:01:26.510 --> 04:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
balance between um the services that can
 
04:01:30.389 --> 04:01:30.399 align:start position:0%
be denied and there's no liability uh
 
04:01:33.790 --> 04:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
protecting there's no patient protection
 
04:01:35.830 --> 04:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
um most critically this bill could lead
 
04:01:38.429 --> 04:01:38.439 align:start position:0%
to delayed or substandard medical care
 
04:01:41.269 --> 04:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire um and it can
 
04:01:44.790 --> 04:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
result in harm or death to patients
 
04:01:46.550 --> 04:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I think is
 
04:01:49.349 --> 04:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
critically important is that in rural
 
04:01:51.990 --> 04:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
areas um where there are few
 
04:01:54.550 --> 04:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
providers patients can be left without
 
04:01:57.710 --> 04:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
any care particularly in Risky and
 
04:01:57.720 --> 04:01:58.990 align:start position:0%
any care particularly in Risky and
dangerous

04:01:58.990 --> 04:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
04:02:02.469 --> 04:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
situations there's no provision for
 
04:02:06.309 --> 04:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
employees giving notice of their um
 
04:02:08.389 --> 04:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
exercise of their rights to conscience
 
04:02:11.750 --> 04:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
so that patients don't know that they're
 
04:02:14.389 --> 04:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
um dealing with somebody with a medical
 
04:02:18.950 --> 04:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
provider who is exercising that right um
 
04:02:21.510 --> 04:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
there's no exception for emergency
 
04:02:24.269 --> 04:02:24.279 align:start position:0%
medical care which is
 
04:02:24.279 --> 04:02:25.990 align:start position:0%
medical care which is
critical

04:02:25.990 --> 04:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
critical
 
04:02:28.309 --> 04:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
um and then although there is an
 
04:02:34.349 --> 04:02:34.359 align:start position:0%
amendment to exclude um to exclude um uh
 
04:02:37.750 --> 04:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
birth control
 
04:02:42.710 --> 04:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
um even that is not sufficient in my
 
04:02:45.349 --> 04:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
point from my point of view um
 
04:02:47.309 --> 04:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
sterilization is still
 
04:02:47.319 --> 04:02:49.990 align:start position:0%
sterilization is still
included

04:02:49.990 --> 04:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
included
 
04:02:52.950 --> 04:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that I think is is
 
04:02:55.870 --> 04:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
very problematic about this bill is that
 
04:02:59.590 --> 04:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
it precludes health care providers
 
04:03:03.269 --> 04:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
from um making any adjustments in their
 
04:03:07.710 --> 04:03:07.720 align:start position:0%
Staffing to um provide services that it
 
04:03:10.750 --> 04:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
is it would be viewed as discrimination
 
04:03:13.950 --> 04:03:13.960 align:start position:0%
for an employer to reassign people to
 
04:03:17.590 --> 04:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
different shifts or different job titles
 
04:03:21.389 --> 04:03:21.399 align:start position:0%
um and so that impacts again impacts
 
04:03:24.349 --> 04:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
patient care
 
04:03:28.750 --> 04:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
um and um those are my major concerns
 
04:03:31.389 --> 04:03:31.399 align:start position:0%
about this bill I strongly oppose it all
 
04:03:33.790 --> 04:03:33.800 align:start position:0%
right anyone else wish to be heard um
 
04:03:35.389 --> 04:03:35.399 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry somebody over yes
 
04:03:36.630 --> 04:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
representative Rambo I think you were
 
04:03:38.790 --> 04:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
next thank you um I think representative
 
04:03:40.950 --> 04:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
Manis was pretty comprehensive uh I just
 
04:03:42.710 --> 04:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate what I raised during
 
04:03:43.990 --> 04:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment discussion with which is
 
04:03:46.189 --> 04:03:46.199 align:start position:0%
that under the bill we have a scenario
 
04:03:47.990 --> 04:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
where a patient could come seeking
 
04:03:50.710 --> 04:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
Medical Care receptionist could deny
 
04:03:52.830 --> 04:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
that care or an appointment does not
 
04:03:55.149 --> 04:03:55.159 align:start position:0%
need to tell any medical provider at the
 
04:03:57.149 --> 04:03:57.159 align:start position:0%
facility does not need to provide a
 
04:03:59.670 --> 04:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
referral does not need to provide an
 
04:04:01.630 --> 04:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
explanation that strikes me as an
 
04:04:02.990 --> 04:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
extremely dangerous situation to be
 
04:04:05.750 --> 04:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
putting patients in so I I appreciate
 
04:04:07.510 --> 04:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
the efforts with the amendment um but it
 
04:04:07.520 --> 04:04:08.429 align:start position:0%
the efforts with the amendment um but it
does

04:04:08.429 --> 04:04:08.439 align:start position:0%
does
 
04:04:10.870 --> 04:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
not it it does not change the underlying
 
04:04:16.389 --> 04:04:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:17.910 --> 04:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh yes representative
 
04:04:22.349 --> 04:04:22.359 align:start position:0%
Perez So to that point um respectfully
 
04:04:25.110 --> 04:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative maners Catholic Hospitals
 
04:04:27.950 --> 04:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
don't put a big sign out front saying we
 
04:04:29.229 --> 04:04:29.239 align:start position:0%
don't do
 
04:04:33.189 --> 04:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
abortions um and they there's a lot of
 
04:04:37.030 --> 04:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
things that Catholic Hospitals do not do
 
04:04:40.469 --> 04:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
but they don't go and advertise that and
 
04:04:43.309 --> 04:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
if someone comes walking in the door
 
04:04:44.950 --> 04:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
they don't don't say to them oh by the
 
04:04:46.670 --> 04:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
way we don't give our birth control or
 
04:04:50.269 --> 04:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
do abortions or tie your tubes
 
04:04:54.149 --> 04:04:54.159 align:start position:0%
um so are you do you feel that our our
 
04:04:59.429 --> 04:04:59.439 align:start position:0%
uh religious hospitals are providing are
 
04:05:01.910 --> 04:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
discriminating against in the same way
 
04:05:04.229 --> 04:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
that some a bill like this would be I'm
 
04:05:06.389 --> 04:05:06.399 align:start position:0%
not trying to be argumentative no I I
 
04:05:08.590 --> 04:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate your question may I may I
 
04:05:11.429 --> 04:05:11.439 align:start position:0%
respond to of course yes
 
04:05:15.349 --> 04:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
um I think the difference is that
 
04:05:17.670 --> 04:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
Catholic Hospitals
 
04:05:20.590 --> 04:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
um exercise their right to not provide
 
04:05:24.990 --> 04:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
certain services but patients know that
 
04:05:27.030 --> 04:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
and so in the first instance in a
 
04:05:27.040 --> 04:05:28.790 align:start position:0%
and so in the first instance in a
non-emergency

04:05:28.790 --> 04:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
non-emergency
 
04:05:32.550 --> 04:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
situation um depending on the on the
 
04:05:34.710 --> 04:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
patient point of view they wouldn't go
 
04:05:37.469 --> 04:05:37.479 align:start position:0%
to a Catholic Hospital but under this
 
04:05:41.550 --> 04:05:41.560 align:start position:0%
bill um somebody in a a a health care
 
04:05:43.790 --> 04:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
provider at a Catholic Hospital wouldn't
 
04:05:46.790 --> 04:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
be able to even say we cannot provide
 
04:05:49.269 --> 04:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
that service but here are three other
 
04:05:51.229 --> 04:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
places where you might go to receive
 
04:05:53.990 --> 04:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
that service and that is very
 
04:05:56.990 --> 04:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
problematic and particularly if if a
 
04:06:01.189 --> 04:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
patient goes into a uh Catholic
 
04:06:04.830 --> 04:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
Hospital and an emergency is either
 
04:06:07.349 --> 04:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
developing or develops after they're
 
04:06:10.870 --> 04:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
there and they need emergency treatment
 
04:06:14.550 --> 04:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
to then not be referred to another
 
04:06:19.830 --> 04:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
provider is is extremely can lead to
 
04:06:21.870 --> 04:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
severe injury or death Catholic
 
04:06:24.070 --> 04:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
Hospitals in an emergent situation
 
04:06:25.750 --> 04:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
having worked in mostly Catholic
 
04:06:28.710 --> 04:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
Hospitals by chance in an emergent
 
04:06:31.670 --> 04:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
situation they do provide any medical
 
04:06:34.830 --> 04:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
care that is required and I have been in
 
04:06:36.990 --> 04:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
multip you s in your micone yeah can
 
04:06:38.750 --> 04:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
yeah please I have been in multiple
 
04:06:40.870 --> 04:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
situations working in a Catholic
 
04:06:44.469 --> 04:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
Hospital where things that they know
 
04:06:47.269 --> 04:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
do are done because of an emergent
 
04:06:50.309 --> 04:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
situation but to your point that people
 
04:06:52.550 --> 04:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
know Catholic Hospitals don't do that I
 
04:06:55.070 --> 04:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
don't I don't agree with that I I I
 
04:06:58.550 --> 04:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
think we are such a diverse uh Community
 
04:07:01.630 --> 04:07:01.640 align:start position:0%
now and society that I do not believe
 
04:07:04.469 --> 04:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
all people know that when they walk into
 
04:07:07.229 --> 04:07:07.239 align:start position:0%
a Catholic Hospital that they won't be
 
04:07:09.269 --> 04:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
able to get their tubes tied if they
 
04:07:12.469 --> 04:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
wanted to so you know um I just disagree
 
04:07:15.550 --> 04:07:15.560 align:start position:0%
with that so again if I could I don't
 
04:07:17.630 --> 04:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
want to end up with a debate here so
 
04:07:18.910 --> 04:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon you had something
 
04:07:19.910 --> 04:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
you want to
 
04:07:23.189 --> 04:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
say well I'm I'm oppos opposes this bill
 
04:07:25.109 --> 04:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
but um even it's a good idea that it
 
04:07:28.429 --> 04:07:28.439 align:start position:0%
only covers uh one particular set of
 
04:07:32.750 --> 04:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
medical procedures um which one at least
 
04:07:35.189 --> 04:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
certain religious groups object je to so
 
04:07:37.389 --> 04:07:37.399 align:start position:0%
there's like a number of other uh
 
04:07:40.070 --> 04:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
medical procedures with various other
 
04:07:41.750 --> 04:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
religious groups mostly much less
 
04:07:43.910 --> 04:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
powerful and much less uh numerous in
 
04:07:45.710 --> 04:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
the Catholic church are opposed to but
 
04:07:48.630 --> 04:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
there's no if we're going to have right
 
04:07:50.429 --> 04:07:50.439 align:start position:0%
to freedom of conscious for medical
 
04:07:51.870 --> 04:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
professionals which are probably you
 
04:07:53.109 --> 04:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
know would probably be more consistent
 
04:07:55.910 --> 04:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
to expand it you know to include U other
 
04:07:57.429 --> 04:07:57.439 align:start position:0%
things that other religious groups
 
04:08:01.309 --> 04:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
object to but I I feel like uh but my
 
04:08:05.429 --> 04:08:05.439 align:start position:0%
main objection bill is just that um the
 
04:08:07.349 --> 04:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
decision to pursue a medical career is a
 
04:08:09.469 --> 04:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
voluntary one so you know you don't
 
04:08:12.189 --> 04:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
necessar nobody's nobody's forced
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
against their will to pursue a medical
 
04:08:15.550 --> 04:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
career and then also your choice of
 
04:08:17.429 --> 04:08:17.439 align:start position:0%
where to be employed is also voluntary
 
04:08:20.389 --> 04:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
one so if you don't want to be involved
 
04:08:22.990 --> 04:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
in um don't want to be involved in
 
04:08:25.070 --> 04:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
abortions or like ifess we took
 
04:08:27.229 --> 04:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
artificial contraception out or these
 
04:08:29.550 --> 04:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
other things you are free to seek out an
 
04:08:31.269 --> 04:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
employer which doesn't even provide
 
04:08:33.030 --> 04:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
those services and then this issue is
 
04:08:34.910 --> 04:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
not going to come up at all so I think
 
04:08:37.790 --> 04:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
that's uh probably would just leave it
 
04:08:39.670 --> 04:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
up to the individuals to decide whether
 
04:08:42.670 --> 04:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
or not a particular career meets their
 
04:08:45.109 --> 04:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
ethical standards and then then also
 
04:08:46.630 --> 04:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
within the career whether the particular
 
04:08:49.790 --> 04:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
employer that they pick um meets your
 
04:08:52.309 --> 04:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
ethical standards and um so I think you
 
04:08:55.429 --> 04:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
know individuals can make individuals uh
 
04:08:57.229 --> 04:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
can make their own choice about what
 
04:08:59.189 --> 04:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
careers to pursue and where where to
 
04:09:02.070 --> 04:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
where to work so I don't I think I don't
 
04:09:04.510 --> 04:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
think this bill is needed at all so all
 
04:09:06.469 --> 04:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
right anyone uh let's see so
 
04:09:08.070 --> 04:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
representative pel and then
 
04:09:10.309 --> 04:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative tur and then
 
04:09:12.990 --> 04:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
represent uh bur thank you I just want
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
to address a couple of the concerns that
 
04:09:19.070 --> 04:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
have come up one on the amendment at the
 
04:09:22.750 --> 04:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
bottom of page two line 36 it says nor
 
04:09:25.309 --> 04:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
shall this section apply to a health
 
04:09:27.189 --> 04:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
care provider who is the only health
 
04:09:29.189 --> 04:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
care provider present in an emergency
 
04:09:31.429 --> 04:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
situation so that would take care of
 
04:09:34.670 --> 04:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
rural Health Care where the physician or
 
04:09:37.349 --> 04:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
any provider might
 
04:09:41.149 --> 04:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
be making the sole determination of the
 
04:09:43.950 --> 04:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
outcome for the of the patient care and
 
04:09:46.309 --> 04:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
then I also want to point to um
 
04:09:47.910 --> 04:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
testimony from New Hampshire right to
 
04:09:51.670 --> 04:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
life where they stated um gave testimony
 
04:09:55.429 --> 04:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
about a case at University of May oh
 
04:09:57.469 --> 04:09:57.479 align:start position:0%
sorry University of Vermont Medical
 
04:10:00.990 --> 04:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
Center and a nurse
 
04:10:04.309 --> 04:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
was um assigned to scrub into I believe
 
04:10:07.070 --> 04:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
scrub into an abortion procedure and she
 
04:10:09.550 --> 04:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
had been on a list of
 
04:10:13.510 --> 04:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
objectors and unfortunately she um felt
 
04:10:15.229 --> 04:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
that she couldn't say no in that
 
04:10:17.070 --> 04:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
situation even though there were other
 
04:10:20.990 --> 04:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
providers um available and she's been
 
04:10:24.269 --> 04:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
traumatized and then um the case was
 
04:10:26.990 --> 04:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
kind of left to go to the Wayside when
 
04:10:29.910 --> 04:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
Federal Administration changed so that's
 
04:10:32.149 --> 04:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
to me is an example of why we need this
 
04:10:33.630 --> 04:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
in New
 
04:10:36.790 --> 04:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative tur yeah thank
 
04:10:39.990 --> 04:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
you um there's a couple of reasons why I
 
04:10:43.630 --> 04:10:43.640 align:start position:0%
think this is uh somewhat of of a danger
 
04:10:45.630 --> 04:10:45.640 align:start position:0%
Bill and it sort of Builds on what
 
04:10:47.269 --> 04:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
representative Rambo said and also a
 
04:10:48.830 --> 04:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
little bit about what representative
 
04:10:51.510 --> 04:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
Perez brought up
 
04:10:54.750 --> 04:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
um in this bill objecting is something
 
04:10:56.630 --> 04:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
you do in your head there's no process
 
04:10:59.189 --> 04:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
for objecting
 
04:11:01.750 --> 04:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
and the way the bill is
 
04:11:04.550 --> 04:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
structured that means patients will not
 
04:11:09.070 --> 04:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
know if their care is being directed by
 
04:11:11.309 --> 04:11:11.319 align:start position:0%
the choice that someone's making in
 
04:11:14.149 --> 04:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
their head or the available or the
 
04:11:16.670 --> 04:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
organization's policies and getting sort
 
04:11:21.469 --> 04:11:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:23.670 --> 04:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
hospitals fundamentally what this bill
 
04:11:27.550 --> 04:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
is about is your ability to make a care
 
04:11:30.710 --> 04:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
Choice other than the policy of the
 
04:11:33.670 --> 04:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
organization that you're employed for so
 
04:11:36.750 --> 04:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't pertain to a Catholic
 
04:11:39.109 --> 04:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
Hospital that has a policy against
 
04:11:42.910 --> 04:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
providing abortion it basically says you
 
04:11:45.229 --> 04:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
as an individual might have a moral
 
04:11:47.510 --> 04:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
objection to something that your your
 
04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
employed provider organization thinks uh
 
04:11:54.710 --> 04:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
would be their policy and you can just
 
04:11:57.469 --> 04:11:57.479 align:start position:0%
basically in your head object to it it
 
04:12:00.269 --> 04:12:00.279 align:start position:0%
also says if that employer finds out
 
04:12:01.830 --> 04:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
that you made the moral
 
04:12:05.149 --> 04:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
objection that you can't be fired you
 
04:12:07.510 --> 04:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
have to be reinstated to your job your
 
04:12:10.429 --> 04:12:10.439 align:start position:0%
actual job so if we found out that the
 
04:12:14.469 --> 04:12:14.479 align:start position:0%
receptionist is not allowing people to
 
04:12:18.030 --> 04:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
into into the clinic and and you said
 
04:12:19.710 --> 04:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
anything about it as an employer you'd
 
04:12:21.910 --> 04:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
be forced to reinstate that person as a
 
04:12:24.590 --> 04:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
receptionist and continue to allow them
 
04:12:27.630 --> 04:12:27.640 align:start position:0%
to basically disrupt your practice you
 
04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
can't even reassign them to a a
 
04:12:33.109 --> 04:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
different job um
 
04:12:36.670 --> 04:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
and uh sorry I lost my I lost my point
 
04:12:39.070 --> 04:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
for a minute but it
 
04:12:42.590 --> 04:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's opening the door to allowing
 
04:12:45.469 --> 04:12:45.479 align:start position:0%
sort of anyone to make decisions in
 
04:12:47.389 --> 04:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
their head and never have to pay the
 
04:12:49.030 --> 04:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
consequences or never even have to
 
04:12:51.429 --> 04:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
disclose to their provider and I I'll
 
04:12:53.710 --> 04:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
one other thought
 
04:12:56.510 --> 04:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
is as pertains to abortion maybe other
 
04:13:00.109 --> 04:13:00.119 align:start position:0%
care uh not covered
 
04:13:03.149 --> 04:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
here the non-provision of those Services
 
04:13:06.030 --> 04:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
is also something people could object to
 
04:13:07.990 --> 04:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if that's covered or
 
04:13:10.710 --> 04:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
not but basically you might say at
 
04:13:12.389 --> 04:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
Catholic Hospital they say well you
 
04:13:15.510 --> 04:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
can't provide the care it's possible for
 
04:13:17.269 --> 04:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
an organization to say and we don't want
 
04:13:19.269 --> 04:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
you making referrals for that care
 
04:13:21.590 --> 04:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
because that's the equivalent and here
 
04:13:23.710 --> 04:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
you could say well I morally object to
 
04:13:25.630 --> 04:13:25.640 align:start position:0%
that that is the standard of care the
 
04:13:28.389 --> 04:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
care is legal the care is available I
 
04:13:30.269 --> 04:13:30.279 align:start position:0%
should be able to refer someone if we're
 
04:13:32.030 --> 04:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
not going to provide it here so there's
 
04:13:33.670 --> 04:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of things in here that I
 
04:13:37.189 --> 04:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
think if you logically follow what this
 
04:13:41.590 --> 04:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
is saying puts uh provider organizations
 
04:13:44.189 --> 04:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
in difficult positions put patients in
 
04:13:47.030 --> 04:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
the position of not really understanding
 
04:13:48.990 --> 04:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
what their their standing is so thank
 
04:13:58.149 --> 04:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:01.109 --> 04:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
bur and the way I like to do some of
 
04:14:04.750 --> 04:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
these things is to take a few steps back
 
04:14:06.790 --> 04:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
and look at the larger
 
04:14:11.109 --> 04:14:11.119 align:start position:0%
implications of legislation like this so
 
04:14:13.750 --> 04:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to talk specifically about
 
04:14:16.149 --> 04:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
the good parts or bad parts of this
 
04:14:18.349 --> 04:14:18.359 align:start position:0%
legislation because I think it's been
 
04:14:23.590 --> 04:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
covered but what we're doing here as a
 
04:14:28.030 --> 04:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
state what we're doing here is carving
 
04:14:32.109 --> 04:14:32.119 align:start position:0%
out something in my opinion from the
 
04:14:36.550 --> 04:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws of our state so
 
04:14:39.790 --> 04:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
let's we have a definition of
 
04:14:42.429 --> 04:14:42.439 align:start position:0%
conscientious objection object because
 
04:14:45.189 --> 04:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
of religious belief or moral or ethic
 
04:14:48.950 --> 04:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
conviction and I'm wondering what ha
 
04:14:52.670 --> 04:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
what the difference is between somebody
 
04:14:55.389 --> 04:14:55.399 align:start position:0%
who says I don't want to serve a black
 
04:14:59.429 --> 04:14:59.439 align:start position:0%
person because of my I have a moral or
 
04:15:02.349 --> 04:15:02.359 align:start position:0%
ethical conviction I don't want to serve
 
04:15:06.389 --> 04:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
a Jewish person because of my moral or
 
04:15:09.910 --> 04:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
ethical convictions I don't want to rent
 
04:15:13.469 --> 04:15:13.479 align:start position:0%
my home uh to I don't want to sell a
 
04:15:18.990 --> 04:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
cake uh a wedding cake to a gay couple
 
04:15:22.349 --> 04:15:22.359 align:start position:0%
uh because of my moral and ethical
 
04:15:25.269 --> 04:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
convictions so what are we really doing
 
04:15:28.510 --> 04:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
here we're carving out out of our
 
04:15:33.070 --> 04:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws and saying well
 
04:15:36.510 --> 04:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
this one is has to do with abortion but
 
04:15:38.790 --> 04:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
what's the next bill and the next bill
 
04:15:42.670 --> 04:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
and the next bill have to say about we
 
04:15:46.030 --> 04:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
don't don't have to treat people uh if
 
04:15:47.429 --> 04:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
we're open for
 
04:15:49.710 --> 04:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
business uh to the public we hold
 
04:15:52.910 --> 04:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves open to the business public we
 
04:15:56.030 --> 04:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
accept the benefits of whether it's tax
 
04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
or or um corporate status or whatever or
 
04:16:04.790 --> 04:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
nonprofit status but we don't want to
 
04:16:08.550 --> 04:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
hold ourselves open to everyone and I
 
04:16:11.429 --> 04:16:11.439 align:start position:0%
think that runs contrary to the whole
 
04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
history of our anti-discrimination laws
 
04:16:17.109 --> 04:16:17.119 align:start position:0%
and that I think is worth thinking about
 
04:16:20.590 --> 04:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else wish to be heard
 
04:16:23.550 --> 04:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
so I guess I would uh say that I I
 
04:16:24.950 --> 04:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
support this
 
04:16:27.309 --> 04:16:27.319 align:start position:0%
because I think the issues that you
 
04:16:30.469 --> 04:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
raise uh representative Burch um those
 
04:16:33.309 --> 04:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
those are the issues you know about uh
 
04:16:35.550 --> 04:16:35.560 align:start position:0%
the the cake as an example I mean those
 
04:16:37.030 --> 04:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
those issues have been before The
 
04:16:40.030 --> 04:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court now a few times and I
 
04:16:41.630 --> 04:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
think that the Supreme what the Supreme
 
04:16:43.790 --> 04:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
Court has said on the constitutional
 
04:16:49.109 --> 04:16:49.119 align:start position:0%
basis is that the the religious um the
 
04:16:52.109 --> 04:16:52.119 align:start position:0%
the religious uh Freedom aspects First
 
04:16:55.870 --> 04:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment freedom of religion aspects of
 
04:16:59.229 --> 04:16:59.239 align:start position:0%
U of A person's belief are something
 
04:17:01.750 --> 04:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
that are entitled to protection and so
 
04:17:04.630 --> 04:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
what I would say is you say carve out uh
 
04:17:06.389 --> 04:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
from the civil rights laws I would say
 
04:17:09.349 --> 04:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
that this is actually adding to the
 
04:17:12.149 --> 04:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
Civil in other words it is saying that
 
04:17:14.149 --> 04:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
you can't just like you can't
 
04:17:16.189 --> 04:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
discriminate on the basis of race or sex
 
04:17:18.030 --> 04:17:18.040 align:start position:0%
or whatever the other categories are you
 
04:17:19.950 --> 04:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
can't discriminate against someone on
 
04:17:21.830 --> 04:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
the basis of their religious beliefs if
 
04:17:25.950 --> 04:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
they if someone has um a a religious
 
04:17:28.189 --> 04:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
belief that says they don't want to do
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
certain things that's entitled to
 
04:17:34.469 --> 04:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
protection um I I think that's so I I
 
04:17:36.469 --> 04:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
think I guess I think that this operates
 
04:17:38.910 --> 04:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
exactly the opposite of the way you uh
 
04:17:42.109 --> 04:17:42.119 align:start position:0%
you describe it and I think there are
 
04:17:44.309 --> 04:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
the uh you know one of the things that I
 
04:17:45.990 --> 04:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
was very concerned about I that's I
 
04:17:47.510 --> 04:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
raised this first rais this issue with
 
04:17:49.830 --> 04:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson is I was saying
 
04:17:53.149 --> 04:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
well the original bill that as it was
 
04:17:57.630 --> 04:17:57.640 align:start position:0%
worded if if some if some for example
 
04:18:00.189 --> 04:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
pro-life group I suppose wanted to try
 
04:18:02.870 --> 04:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
to you know upend the operations of
 
04:18:05.469 --> 04:18:05.479 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood would they be able to
 
04:18:08.630 --> 04:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
have you know for lack of a better term
 
04:18:10.710 --> 04:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
an undercover a bunch of undercovered
 
04:18:12.910 --> 04:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
doctors go in take accept employment
 
04:18:15.309 --> 04:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
with Planned Parenthood and then say I
 
04:18:17.229 --> 04:18:17.239 align:start position:0%
refuse to perform abortions and I'm
 
04:18:19.229 --> 04:18:19.239 align:start position:0%
covered by I'm entitled to protection
 
04:18:21.469 --> 04:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
under the statute and representative P
 
04:18:22.830 --> 04:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
Pearson understood that and that's why
 
04:18:24.790 --> 04:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
he put in the the change that said if
 
04:18:27.910 --> 04:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's a if a major part of the operate of
 
04:18:30.910 --> 04:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
a the the business's operation is to
 
04:18:34.469 --> 04:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
perform abortions um you can't then go
 
04:18:36.830 --> 04:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
to you know and you know that you you
 
04:18:38.510 --> 04:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
take a job with Planned Parenthood you
 
04:18:40.469 --> 04:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
then can't say I'm not going to perform
 
04:18:42.910 --> 04:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
abortions but if it's not that if it's
 
04:18:45.309 --> 04:18:45.319 align:start position:0%
just you know the hospital performs a
 
04:18:46.990 --> 04:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of different things and
 
04:18:49.510 --> 04:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
abortion might be something that's done
 
04:18:52.469 --> 04:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
um occasionally then then the the
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
person's right to to exercise their
 
04:18:56.109 --> 04:18:56.119 align:start position:0%
freedom of conscience should should
 
04:18:58.109 --> 04:18:58.119 align:start position:0%
apply I think that I think that makes
 
04:19:02.910 --> 04:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
sense I I would just go back to the um
 
04:19:06.590 --> 04:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
cases not the cake cases but the cases
 
04:19:11.389 --> 04:19:11.399 align:start position:0%
that talk about um uh public
 
04:19:12.990 --> 04:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
accommodations they make make a
 
04:19:14.349 --> 04:19:14.359 align:start position:0%
distinction between public
 
04:19:16.910 --> 04:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
accommodations and private if you are
 
04:19:19.590 --> 04:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
going to be a public accommodation you
 
04:19:23.590 --> 04:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
can't have a sign that says no blacks uh
 
04:19:26.790 --> 04:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
because um uh that kind of
 
04:19:29.630 --> 04:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
discrimination has not been accepted so
 
04:19:33.349 --> 04:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
why not have that kind of concept for
 
04:19:34.830 --> 04:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
your hospital if you want to have a
 
04:19:37.109 --> 04:19:37.119 align:start position:0%
private hospital and run it the way you
 
04:19:39.910 --> 04:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
want to and get no benefits from being a
 
04:19:43.229 --> 04:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
public institution fine have ADD it
 
04:19:45.149 --> 04:19:45.159 align:start position:0%
but if you're a public institution and
 
04:19:47.550 --> 04:19:47.560 align:start position:0%
getting all the benefits of being a
 
04:19:50.950 --> 04:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
public institution then be like a public
 
04:19:53.830 --> 04:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
accommodation and say anybody walks in
 
04:19:57.429 --> 04:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
the door that wants our services you
 
04:20:00.229 --> 04:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
know is entitled to our services now if
 
04:20:01.750 --> 04:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
those Services aren't there that's
 
04:20:04.550 --> 04:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
something else that's just my point okay
 
04:20:07.189 --> 04:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
all right representative man the problem
 
04:20:10.189 --> 04:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
is patients won't know and can't know
 
04:20:12.389 --> 04:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
whether they're getting safe reliable
 
04:20:16.990 --> 04:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
and accurate information and that is one
 
04:20:19.910 --> 04:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
of the major problems with this
 
04:20:22.349 --> 04:20:22.359 align:start position:0%
bill all right any other representative
 
04:20:24.630 --> 04:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
CH yeah I just I just wanted to point
 
04:20:27.510 --> 04:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
out um sort of building on some of
 
04:20:30.830 --> 04:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
what's being said um page on the amended
 
04:20:35.269 --> 04:20:35.279 align:start position:0%
version page two line 11 section five it
 
04:20:37.670 --> 04:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
still says a healthc care provider means
 
04:20:39.990 --> 04:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
any individual who as part of her his or
 
04:20:41.910 --> 04:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
her employment may be asked to
 
04:20:44.389 --> 04:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
participate in in any way in an abortion
 
04:20:44.399 --> 04:20:45.229 align:start position:0%
participate in in any way in an abortion
or

04:20:45.229 --> 04:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:20:47.550 --> 04:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
sterilization but not limited to a
 
04:20:50.389 --> 04:20:50.399 align:start position:0%

furnishes to assist Furnishing an
 
04:21:07.710 --> 04:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
abortion or sterilization this is way
 
04:21:12.189 --> 04:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
more than telling a doctor that they
 
04:21:14.030 --> 04:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
have the right to consciously
 
04:21:17.910 --> 04:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
conscientiously object to a performing
 
04:21:19.750 --> 04:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
of an abortion this basically means
 
04:21:21.950 --> 04:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
anyone in any organization who can
 
04:21:24.469 --> 04:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
reasonably claim that they are somehow
 
04:21:27.830 --> 04:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
possibly connected to an abortion or a
 
04:21:29.950 --> 04:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
sterilization which again we took out
 
04:21:31.830 --> 04:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
contraception but sterilization is a
 
04:21:32.910 --> 04:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
form of
 
04:21:35.469 --> 04:21:35.479 align:start position:0%
contraception um I think makes this
 
04:21:37.990 --> 04:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
really open-ended and dangerous I hope
 
04:21:40.389 --> 04:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
people consider that all right anyone
 
04:21:42.950 --> 04:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
else have anything they want to say
 
04:21:44.429 --> 04:21:44.439 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
04:21:47.269 --> 04:21:47.279 align:start position:0%

my colleagues that I was thinking about
 
04:21:50.550 --> 04:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
voting for this but I really after
 
04:21:51.670 --> 04:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
thinking about it I really don't think I
 
04:21:54.790 --> 04:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
can support this bill as written um I'm
 
04:21:57.389 --> 04:21:57.399 align:start position:0%
concerned about um unintended
 
04:21:59.590 --> 04:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
consequences of enacting something like
 
04:22:02.510 --> 04:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
this um especially you know being being
 
04:22:04.109 --> 04:22:04.119 align:start position:0%
a homosexual what the what the
 
04:22:06.950 --> 04:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
implications of not prescribing like you
 
04:22:08.790 --> 04:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
know HIV prevention drugs or something
 
04:22:13.030 --> 04:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
like that if they if it wasn't if it
 
04:22:15.750 --> 04:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
if somebody objected to a lifestyle that
 
04:22:17.950 --> 04:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
somebody else has I guess I'm I'm really
 
04:22:19.269 --> 04:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
really conflicted on this and I just
 
04:22:21.149 --> 04:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
want my colleagues to know I I think I'm
 
04:22:25.229 --> 04:22:25.239 align:start position:0%

this letter I got from chman wer but
 
04:26:08.630 --> 04:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
we've been going too long so I'm just
 
04:26:11.710 --> 04:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
gonna we'll deal with that um yeah
 
04:26:13.750 --> 04:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
either Wednesday or next week so you
 
04:26:16.590 --> 04:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
know what just just for everybody's um
 
04:26:18.990 --> 04:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
information so we're so Wednesday we
 
04:26:21.870 --> 04:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
have hearings we start at nine o'clock
 
04:26:23.950 --> 04:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
we won't be executing anything Wednesday
 
04:26:27.550 --> 04:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
the next executive session which it it I
 
04:26:29.309 --> 04:26:29.319 align:start position:0%
think it's been posted but for somehow
 
04:26:30.990 --> 04:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
some reason it didn't get in the in the
 
04:26:33.229 --> 04:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
calendar this week the next executive
 
04:26:35.429 --> 04:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
session will be a week from today on the
 
04:26:38.149 --> 04:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
10th starting at 1:00 and the reason
 
04:26:40.389 --> 04:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
it's starting at 1 is I have an Ethics
 
04:26:42.750 --> 04:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
Committee meeting at 10:
 
04:26:44.389 --> 04:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
so I and that's going to take a while
 
04:26:46.990 --> 04:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
because we got a bunch of stuff to do so
 
04:26:51.830 --> 04:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
we'll start at 1:00 to exec um the the
 
04:26:56.750 --> 04:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
um a bunch of bills and then um then our
 
04:27:00.750 --> 04:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
last sort of pre crossover meeting will
 
04:27:03.990 --> 04:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
be the following Wednesday on the 12th
