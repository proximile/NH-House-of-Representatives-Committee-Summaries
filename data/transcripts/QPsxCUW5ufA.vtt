00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
I'll open the uh public hear sorry
 
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
public discussion the sub committee for
 
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 align:start position:0%

gifts um chairman
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
McDonald uh was kind of enough to reach
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
out to legal for legal advice and based
 
00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 align:start position:0%
upon that advice which was from
 
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
James Cante thank you Cante um based
 
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
upon his opinion which basically says
 
00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759 align:start position:0%
this is a potential conflict with and
 
00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
preempted by federal law and also
 
00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:01.759 align:start position:0%
potential conflict with urrent New
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law my recommendation I think
 
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
for the committee to discuss is that
 
00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
legal interpretation because if it
 
00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:10.759 align:start position:0%
stands the way it's written I think we
 
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
need to itl the
 
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
bill but I'd love to hear from the other
 
00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:20.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee chairman I yes they just
 
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120 align:start position:0%
following up on that um I talked to
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
attorney seans who's the house legal
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
counsel and and he didn't offer an
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
official opinion but he said that that
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
there's a reason to believe that it
 
00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:36.759 align:start position:0%
could conflict with other state laws I
 
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
was just looking from my copy I printed
 
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
out the email last night and I I don't
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
seem to have it handy but um it
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
indicated it could create a conflict
 
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
with other state statutes and also
 
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
ultimately uh federal law and a there a
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh very problematic to say the least
 
00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:00.430 align:start position:0%
uh very problematic to say the least
so

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
the other thing which I think is also
 
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
Brewing or out unsettled at current time
 
00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
is the federal did federal government
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
did change the federal statutes which
 
00:08:13.149 --> 00:08:13.159 align:start position:0%
CMS is working its way through and
 
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
trying to understand how to interpret
 
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
the federal law uh through regulations
 
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
on how
 
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
to break AP part they consider to be in
 
00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
Monopoly if you will I think at that
 
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039 align:start position:0%
point in time a lot of the Federal
 
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:29.240 align:start position:0%
Regulations are still to be done and
 
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
still to be written and I think at this
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
point in time it's premature for us even
 
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
with the interpretation from our legal
 
00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:36.919 align:start position:0%
council but given what's going on the
 
00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:38.599 align:start position:0%
federal level for us to move forward in
 
00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:42.709 align:start position:0%
federal level for us to move forward in
this

00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:44.389 align:start position:0%
 
bill

00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:08:47.949 --> 00:08:47.959 align:start position:0%
Plaza so I I read the conclusion of
 
00:08:52.509 --> 00:08:52.519 align:start position:0%
legal council is not conclusive it could
 
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
conflict but uh maybe it won't conflict
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
with a uh uh Federal loss or loss in
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
other states and uh I still think that
 
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
there there was some Merit and what this
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
bill was trying to solve like we still
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
have some shortage of organs and uh then
 
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
there are some additional questions
 
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
about like organ quality uh but
 
00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
um I intend to join you uh in in your
 
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
decision because um I see that uh this
 
00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
bill is just not ready uh doesn't have
 
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
enough support and statistics and uh uh
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
as far as I saw uh there are some other
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
ideas some other uh pieces of
 
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
legislation uh coming our way thank you
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you repr yeah thank you um also
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
I've heard and I I got it second hand
 
00:09:57.069 --> 00:09:57.079 align:start position:0%
but from a good source that the prime
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill representative
 
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
Kimbrell's is is comfortable with itl
 
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
also thank you represent mury thank you
 
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
um I was not on the subcommittee for
 
00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
this uh bill that was retained but I was
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
asked to sub in today um uh
 
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
in you know from my perspective from a
 
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.350 align:start position:0%
in you know from my perspective from a
clinical

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
clinical
 
00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:22.519 align:start position:0%
perspective you know regardless of legal
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
you know interpretation you know to me a
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
bill of this nature is antithetical to
 
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
the care of patients meaning that if you
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
give preference to a patient for an
 
00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
organ that they need but because of
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
geography it is not allowed to happen
 
00:10:43.949 --> 00:10:43.959 align:start position:0%
that really does speak to the ethical
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
nature of this and the concerns and I
 
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
think it would also be very harmful as I
 
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously in the spring it'd
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
be very harmful the patients in the the
 
00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:52.839 align:start position:0%
citizens of New
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right now currently the only
 
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
organ transplant that's done in the
 
00:10:59.629 --> 00:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
state is basically basically kidney
 
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
transplants at Dartmouth Hitchcock and
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
if states in the New England organ donor
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
you know group that coordinates these
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
transfers uh these
 
00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
transplants um uh were to be compromised
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
in their ability to facilitate those
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
kind of procedures then our patients our
 
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
citizens would be harmed if for instance
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
somebody needed a heart lung transplant
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
in Boston but Boston says you know they
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
don't take ours we're not going to take
 
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
yours you know I mean we're really
 
00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:31.639 align:start position:0%
harming ourselves in many way because we
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources to do the type
 
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
of transplants that many of our Citizens
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
need in the state um so I understand the
 
00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:41.959 align:start position:0%
intent was to try to protect our own
 
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
individuals but frankly from a clinical
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
perspective it is really going to be
 
00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:48.519 align:start position:0%
harmful to our citizens uh as it was
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
written um it would also be I think
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
unethical to withhold a transplant to a
 
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
patient who is higher on the list
 
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
because of need um and also it would
 
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.990 align:start position:0%
because of need um and also it would
potentially

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
compromise transplants in general
 
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
because time is of a very limiting
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
factor when you have an organ that could
 
00:12:11.629 --> 00:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
be transplanted and if you are
 
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
restricted by the ability of um an organ
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
transplant team to say I have to check
 
00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
with everybody in New Hampshire before I
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
use this organ then I I I think the
 
00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
organ itself could die in a cooling bag
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know before it could get to the
 
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
right person so you know I again I
 
00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
wasn't on the subcommittee but I would
 
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
just voice my concerns about this
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
concept in general from a a medical
 
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
clinical perspective so thank you thank
 
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
committee if not I'd like to entertain a
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
motion by
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%

mind presenting
 
01:08:22.839 --> 01:08:26.550 align:start position:0%
mind presenting
this

01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
but having said that he did I know I'm
 
01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
only kid
 
01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:35.030 align:start position:0%
only kid
um

01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
um um myself and representative Merchant
 
01:08:41.229 --> 01:08:41.239 align:start position:0%
and uh several others are on the um uh
 
01:08:45.149 --> 01:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
HHS oversight Committee in last fall it
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
came to our attention that there was an
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
incident that occurred uh in a health
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
you know facility in the state um that
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
was reported U by an outside um news
 
01:08:59.950 --> 01:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
source uh and what we came to realize
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
was that there was a malpractice there
 
01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
was multiple malpractice suits by a
 
01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
provider 20 in fact that were reported
 
01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
on the Board of Medicine website in
 
01:09:13.709 --> 01:09:13.719 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and this paper was out of
 
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
Boston so they picked up on it and when
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
they curiously looked at the Board of
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
Medicine website in New Hampshire not
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
one of these um lawsuits was U mentioned
 
01:09:25.349 --> 01:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
so it came to our attention that perhaps
 
01:09:29.070 --> 01:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
there was um uh a process problem um uh
 
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
in reporting and in um uh transparency
 
01:09:35.950 --> 01:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
with um um for the patients in the state
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
to understand exactly who is taking care
 
01:09:42.309 --> 01:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
of them and what may be going on so we
 
01:09:44.110 --> 01:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
initially looked at this after about
 
01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
three or four sessions whereby we had
 
01:09:48.510 --> 01:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
multiple people come in and testify
 
01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
about uh what had potentially happened
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
and without trying to specifically
 
01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
uh get into the weeds or even litigate
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
potentially uh the incident itself we
 
01:10:01.229 --> 01:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
became aware that this this is more of a
 
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
process issue so our concern was not
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
with any incidents that happened prior
 
01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
to that it was more of a a go forward
 
01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
process issue that we were looking at
 
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
specifically with reporting of uh
 
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
potential uh malpractice or um um
 
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
grievances or complaints that occur in
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
any Healthcare facility in the state and
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
how does that information then get to
 
01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine uh to oplc and and
 
01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
and how they acted upon how they how do
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
they get the information by whom does
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
that information from whom does that
 
01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
information come from within the
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
healthcare facility um once it gets to a
 
01:10:44.910 --> 01:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine who basically um
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
interprets the the complaint and how is
 
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
a decision made we came to realize that
 
01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
uh one of the issues in the Board of
 
01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
Medicine is that most complaints if not
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
all complaints are vetted by a single
 
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
retired physician and oftentimes you can
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
get with a complaint charts and charts
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
from a patient's record and it's very
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
difficult to sip through them and
 
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
without any executive summary or any
 
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.229 align:start position:0%
without any executive summary or any
clear

01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:12.679 align:start position:0%
understanding issues may be Mis
 
01:11:15.149 --> 01:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted or even missed altogether
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
so we came to realize that it's
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
potentially a problem in the Board of
 
01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
Medicine that they're underst staffed
 
01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
which I think they probably are but also
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that you know there may be a
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
need for a more robust vetting process
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 445 was put forward that
 
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
was basically trying to um uh help
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
support financially oplc it went through
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
Edna and um pass out Edna ought to pass
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
but was retained in I believe Ways and
 
01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
Means subsequent to that so one of the
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
issues that we then came up with was you
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
know maybe we need to understand the
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
process a complaint is made
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
whether it comes to a malpractice suit
 
01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
in a healthcare facility how does that
 
01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
get to the Board of Medicine who then
 
01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
interprets what happened how is the
 
01:12:07.229 --> 01:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
decision made as to any consequences
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
whether it be um basically a reprimand
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
up to and potentially loss of
 
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
license how is that then reported on the
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
board of medicine and how is that then
 
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately available to the public to
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
understand exactly who taking care of
 
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
them what their track record is and that
 
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
sort of thing so we initially thought
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
that potentially we could put forward
 
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
legislation that would give us some
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
guidance and some regulations and we
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
realized quite early on in the process
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
that we really didn't understand the
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
process well enough and therefore
 
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
instead of potentially coming up with
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
regulations or legislation that would um
 
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
either say you got to have more
 
01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
resources for the Board of Medicine or
 
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
um the the reporting facility has to
 
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
generate um um you know a more clear uh
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
executive summary of what happened um
 
01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
how does the process then get through to
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine and then report it
 
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
on the website so that patients know and
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
to my mind it really becomes a quality
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
of care issue you have to understand you
 
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
know who is taking care of you you have
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
to understand if there's been any
 
01:13:22.629 --> 01:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
problems I mean to have 20 lawsuits in a
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
neighboring state none reported on our
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
website really is not very transparent
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't help our patients and
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
becomes potentially dangerous so we
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
didn't want to get into the weeds of and
 
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
so then you have to understand what then
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
gets reported on the
 
01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
website I can tell you that there's a
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
lot of lawsuits that occur that are
 
01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
frivolous you know and you know if if a
 
01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
patient has a complication and they have
 
01:13:48.669 --> 01:13:48.679 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit they're entitled to have a
 
01:13:50.830 --> 01:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
lawsuit but it may be a frivolous
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that never gets to you know a
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
court or any kind of um um adjudication
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
but I mean we have books written on
 
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
complications in surgery I mean there's
 
01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
a reason we have those because they are
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
they exist and every time there's a
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
complication doesn't mean you get sued
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
so we didn't want to have every
 
01:14:10.189 --> 01:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
potential lawsuit you know we could have
 
01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
put forward legislation that said every
 
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
lawsuit is on the website that can be
 
01:14:16.110 --> 01:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
potentially terribly damning to any
 
01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
provider uh it takes a lot of time it
 
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of emotional toll and it's
 
01:14:22.229 --> 01:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
just not fair so we were trying to
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
figure out what we needed to have
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
reported on the website so the bottom
 
01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
line is to all of this is that we
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
understand there's a potential process
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
problem we understand that the public
 
01:14:36.189 --> 01:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
informed in our society we are coming to
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
the point where we are losing trust in
 
01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
some of the more venerable aspects of
 
01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
our society whether it's politics clergy
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
health care and this is a way to try to
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
restore trust in healthc care in the
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
state whereby we can put forward a very
 
01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
transparent process to understand
 
01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
exactly who is taking care of these
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
patients and they can then choose but
 
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
they they have to have available the
 
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
information and so what we decided
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
instead of putting forward any specific
 
01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:10.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the Board of Medicine
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
or any
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
legislation was to simply try to come up
 
01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
with a committee not a commission but a
 
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
committee uh with um a few uh Amendment
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
CLE one amendment that we did that
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant Drew up that uh
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
instead of having three we had four
 
01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
members of the house two from Edna and
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
two from uh HHS uh and then also two
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
members from the Senate and I'm sorry
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
yes could we have the amendment
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
number uh let me see I think it's two at
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:57.870 --> 01:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think we have the amendment
 
01:15:59.229 --> 01:15:59.239 align:start position:0%
I don't think we have the amendment this
 
01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
was what was drawn up and I'm not sure
 
01:16:02.669 --> 01:16:02.679 align:start position:0%
that we have the amendment at this point
 
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
in time is that an amendment you're we
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
want to move forward this morning or I
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
believe so yes um excuse me was it was
 
01:16:13.149 --> 01:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
it if I may Mist yeah sure go ahead was
 
01:16:15.390 --> 01:16:15.400 align:start position:0%
it has it been drafted already or is
 
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
this something that is in drafted I
 
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
think it is in drafting is that correct
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
okay then we can't vote on it now okay
 
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
so if we can't vote on it now it might
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
be a good idea to either wait till the
 
01:16:29.629 --> 01:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
end of this session to see if it's
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
drafted or to take it up on the 13th
 
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
because we can't vote on it unless we
 
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
have of course the event sure of course
 
01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
understood yeah I was going to say this
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
that what we were planning on is
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
basically to change the makeup of the
 
01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
committee and also to incorporate into
 
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
the invited guests that would be invited
 
01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis um as stakeholders in
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
into the process would be the um the
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
nursing association as well aside from
 
01:16:59.390 --> 01:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
that there was no significant material
 
01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
changes uh that we were coming up with
 
01:17:03.629 --> 01:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
but again I wanted to mention it that
 
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
was what the only change that we had to
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
the original bill when was the amendment
 
01:17:10.110 --> 01:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
submitted to
 
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
alls I represent M did you know don't
 
01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
know that CHR is that something you
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
could check on for us or does he have
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.830 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:34.669 align:start position:0%
 
322

01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
322
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
sure yeah and and did you did you submit
 
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
it or because it looks to me looking at
 
01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
the people that nobody submitted it I
 
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
think I thought you
 
01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
did so I I think it needs to be
 
01:17:51.149 --> 01:17:51.159 align:start position:0%
submitted to OS I agree yeah and we need
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
okay y
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.189 align:start position:0%
 
we'll

01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%

01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%

01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:30.520 align:start position:0%

not uh would you like to speak to your
 
01:19:35.709 --> 01:19:35.719 align:start position:0%
motion briefly
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
um uh this was a bill uh to establish an
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
ALS registry in the State uh initially
 
01:19:43.149 --> 01:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
as drafted we were going to have it
 
01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
housed and supported through the state
 
01:19:49.629 --> 01:19:49.639 align:start position:0%
um it became obvious that the fiscal
 
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
note in the responsibility to do so
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
would be better um if we could do it uh
 
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
at DH through the summer so we retained
 
01:19:58.990 --> 01:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
it at that point in the spring through
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
the summer I met with DH legal it uh
 
01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
medical folks and it became very
 
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
apparent to all of us that at this point
 
01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
in time they um were not going to be
 
01:20:11.629 --> 01:20:11.639 align:start position:0%
able to um logistically and
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
operationally set up a registry and
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
support it financially and also dealing
 
01:20:18.910 --> 01:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
with the IT issues of confidentiality so
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
at that point in time we we agreed uh
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
and Dr stel Who a neurologist uh who uh
 
01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
asked me to um submit this um is now
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
trying to think about Alternatives or
 
01:20:32.350 --> 01:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
working on alternatives to get a
 
01:20:34.350 --> 01:20:34.360 align:start position:0%
registry started in the state so as of
 
01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:37.960 align:start position:0%

you like to speak to your motion sure so
 
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
um as the prime sponsor of House Bill
 
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
406 um I was concerned with the uh the
 
01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:21.639 align:start position:0%
need for parents and I am concerned with
 
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
the need for parents to have um adequate
 
01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
access to their children's medical
 
01:23:30.510 --> 01:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
records um what uh and and Hippa does
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
Grant parents access to most of their
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
children's medical records with certain
 
01:23:38.590 --> 01:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
exceptions um defined in New Hampshire
 
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
statute and federal law um the real
 
01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:44.719 align:start position:0%
sticking point here or the real concern
 
01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:23:50.110 --> 01:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
um portal access which is how most
 
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
people typically get information about
 
01:23:54.270 --> 01:23:54.280 align:start position:0%
their medical records medical
 
01:23:57.870 --> 01:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
appointments and so forth um is simply
 
01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
turned off when a child turns 12 and um
 
01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
what we learned through this process is
 
01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
that that is primarily driven by a
 
01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
technical limitation in the software
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
provided by uh vendors who who um create
 
01:24:16.590 --> 01:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
software for electronic medical records
 
01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:20.199 align:start position:0%
and so forth and the portal software
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
that accesses those records so um it is
 
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
a technical limitation at this point um
 
01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
the federal government has acknowledged
 
01:24:30.510 --> 01:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
this as well because they excluded
 
01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
patient portals from the uh the
 
01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
information blocking rule uh for
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
technical reasons as well this is still
 
01:24:39.709 --> 01:24:39.719 align:start position:0%
an issue that I would like to see
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
resolved however it does not seem
 
01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate to try to resolve it with
 
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
legislation at this time uh which is why
 
01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:50.679 align:start position:0%
I'm moving itl thank
 
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%

for this
 
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
bill okay is there a second
 
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
um would you like to speak to your
 
01:26:27.070 --> 01:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
motion sure I apologize for sending two
 
01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
long-winded amendments to you that we
 
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
don't really need anymore I hope um so
 
01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
this bill is very important to me I've
 
01:26:37.709 --> 01:26:37.719 align:start position:0%
been involved in this bill for about
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
five years now um it's been presented a
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
couple times basically the goal of it is
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
we understand that an opioid Crisis
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
happen because patients don't have
 
01:26:51.669 --> 01:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
access to other therapies and it's been
 
01:26:53.310 --> 01:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
our goal for a long time for me
 
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
personally for over 30 years to improve
 
01:26:58.510 --> 01:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
access to other options for care um
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where this bill came from
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
originally it was originally presented
 
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
by um representative Maja py I think
 
01:27:06.910 --> 01:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
four years ago was
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
preco and um we looked at it as a group
 
01:27:11.709 --> 01:27:11.719 align:start position:0%
of stakeholders and we looked at the
 
01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
bill and we we like the concept but we
 
01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
didn't like the bill and we sat down and
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
talked with her about it and wanted to
 
01:27:20.669 --> 01:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
create a an ad hoc Group which we
 
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
eventually did to study it come up with
 
01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
a better bill um subsequently
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative lungren who was the
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill and is involved in
 
01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
what our current efforts are um took it
 
01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
on really without changing anything and
 
01:27:36.910 --> 01:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
we sat down talked with them and said we
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
really need to fix this bill we think
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
that it's important but not the way it
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
is the St was when I gave it to him he
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
functionally took our bill stuck it in
 
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
that bill and now we have two bills in
 
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
one one of which actually made it to
 
01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
Commerce so this bill exist exists in
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
two different forms and two different
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
committees which became a real problem
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
um with that said um and I've talked to
 
01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
Chairman hunt about this as well and I I
 
01:28:04.270 --> 01:28:04.280 align:start position:0%
think that this bill is extremely
 
01:28:07.709 --> 01:28:07.719 align:start position:0%
important um going forward to really
 
01:28:09.629 --> 01:28:09.639 align:start position:0%
drive the discussion about how do we
 
01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
improve access to care to a bride
 
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
variety of therapies and what's the best
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
ways to do it the good news is we passed
 
01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
HB 66 which has created a committee to
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
look at these issues and we feel um in
 
01:28:23.790 --> 01:28:23.800 align:start position:0%
our committee that this is extremely
 
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
important that we um keep this bill
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
alive um if necessary work on it the
 
01:28:31.390 --> 01:28:31.400 align:start position:0%
good news is the interim committee
 
01:28:34.189 --> 01:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
already exists um representative McKay
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant myself and
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative lren are already working
 
01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
on these issues right now and we have a
 
01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
broad group of stakeholders that are
 
01:28:43.629 --> 01:28:43.639 align:start position:0%
involved including insurers which I
 
01:28:46.109 --> 01:28:46.119 align:start position:0%
think is incredibly important um as well
 
01:28:48.030 --> 01:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
as all the different providers of the
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
different services that would be
 
01:28:52.350 --> 01:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
affected by this and I think that that's
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
important it's unusual to see that kind
 
01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
of cooperation in healthc care issues
 
01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
like this so um at this point the bill
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
is important to me that it stay alive um
 
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
that I think that it can be worked on if
 
01:29:07.149 --> 01:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
we need to and that we can make it um
 
01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
work to improve access to these
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
therapies that these people really don't
 
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
have right
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
now okay thank you any discussion
 
01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:19.669 align:start position:0%
now okay thank you any discussion
representative

01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:22.030 --> 01:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
Weber I just wanted to say that I I
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
think that that's a good resolution for
 
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
this bill because um all of us I think
 
01:29:33.310 --> 01:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
join in the concerns about providing the
 
01:29:36.510 --> 01:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
widest range of treatment options for
 
01:29:41.109 --> 01:29:41.119 align:start position:0%
people in chronic pain uh the issue is
 
01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
that the bill is
 
01:29:46.030 --> 01:29:46.040 align:start position:0%
drafted um and this has been an issue
 
01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
that's been hard to Grapple with is the
 
01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
the number of modalities ities that are
 
01:29:56.109 --> 01:29:56.119 align:start position:0%
in here some of which are licensed
 
01:29:59.310 --> 01:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
professions and therefore might lend
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
themselves well to insurance
 
01:30:04.709 --> 01:30:04.719 align:start position:0%
reimbursement some of which are things
 
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
that uh may have a variety of
 
01:30:11.470 --> 01:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
practitioners who vary from the very
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
well-trained very ethical very competent
 
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
to the completely unregulated and that
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
that's a concern I think again for all
 
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
of us so um knowing that the people
 
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
involved are are in fact very involved
 
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
and want to keep this conversation going
 
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
forward and there is a study committee
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
I'm very comfortable with the interim
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
study recommendation and I thank the
 
01:30:40.750 --> 01:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
committee for its work and I thank you
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%

01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
perfect I mean we all agreed with
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
everything that you just said and it's
 
01:30:49.629 --> 01:30:49.639 align:start position:0%
been exciting to create Innovative
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
strategies on how to finance all these
 
01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
things in in a New Hampshire way because
 
01:30:56.109 --> 01:30:56.119 align:start position:0%
that's the challenge is to do it our way
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
not somebody else's way um but that's
 
01:31:00.510 --> 01:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
what we're doing thank

House Bill 322 the only changes that

01:34:51.870 --> 01:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
members of the house two two of whom
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
would be from HHS and two would be from

Edna two members from the house from the

Senate and also includes in the um
 
01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
invited um uh uh members of the um for
 
01:35:08.590 --> 01:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
for attendance would be a member of the
 
01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire nurse practitioner
 
01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
Association uh there was one date change
 
01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:16.360 align:start position:0%
at the very bottom um from November 20
 
01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
November 1st of 2023 to November uh 1st
 
01:35:23.629 --> 01:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
of 2024 so substantively no real changes
 
01:35:29.149 --> 01:35:29.159 align:start position:0%
uh to the original Bill thank you other
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Merchant oh
 
01:35:33.709 --> 01:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative uh Leon uh
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I had also seen
 
01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
this whole process as it showed up over
 
01:35:40.590 --> 01:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
that previous summer and did it happen
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
in an area where I had I had worked I
 
01:35:44.189 --> 01:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
had worked with these implantable
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
devices um so to me some of that path
 
01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
was a little bit more transparent than
 
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
people working in other areas of
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
medicine we had submitted another bill
 
01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill 4554 which made it through
 
01:35:56.109 --> 01:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
the house but unfortunately died on the
 
01:35:58.669 --> 01:35:58.679 align:start position:0%
other side over in the Senate and
 
01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
therefore I think let's move full steam
 
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
ahead with this because we need to make
 
01:36:04.590 --> 01:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
sure that um people aren't going in
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
blind to procedures when there's
 
01:36:08.109 --> 01:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
information about risks especially
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
regarding the person doing the procedure
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
that they're otherwise unaware
 
01:36:16.830 --> 01:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing no other discussion
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the clerk to call the all
 
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%

off with we recognized that we did not

have enough information we asked our uh
 
01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
for additional research information to

funding was already in the house budget
 
01:39:41.589 --> 01:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
as well as from outs outside resources
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%

like several others that we've
 
01:40:03.550 --> 01:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
considered in subcommittees is a prime
 
01:40:06.589 --> 01:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
example of a bill that was filed at a
 
01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
time when there was a very great need
 
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
and and circumstances have changed I'm
 
01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
I'm glad that we held on to it but it
 
01:40:18.750 --> 01:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
appears that the problem has
 
01:40:21.790 --> 01:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
been nibbled at if not addressed
 
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:26.480 align:start position:0%

01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
anatomical
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
gifts um I'm I'm going to make a motion
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
to itl that bill uh do I have a second
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
second okay representative Merchant
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
seconds um
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee for that bill I was
 
01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
comprised of Representative Merchant is
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
the chairman representative Parmer
 
01:42:30.430 --> 01:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
representative POF and
 
01:42:34.270 --> 01:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
myself uh there was a question about um
 
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
how that might about the legal aspects
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
of that uh I did uh confer with house
 
01:42:43.109 --> 01:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
legal counsel and uh that does have the
 
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
potential of conflicting with current
 
01:42:47.709 --> 01:42:47.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state law specifically RSA
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
263 col 41 by allowing a New Hampshire
 
01:42:53.950 --> 01:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
first check box but such an amendment
 
01:42:55.830 --> 01:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
might conf conflict with the provisions
 
01:43:00.109 --> 01:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
of RSA 291a The Uniform Anatomical Gift
 
01:43:03.950 --> 01:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
Act um so that's that's one concern that
 
01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
this bill raises another bill another
 
01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
issue is it might conflict or be
 
01:43:11.709 --> 01:43:11.719 align:start position:0%
preempted by federal
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
law so uh after uh after being um after
 
01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
hearing these things from house legal
 
01:43:20.830 --> 01:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
councel uh he's not offering a
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
definitive opinion but certainly he's
 
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
raised some serious questions it makes
 
01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
no sense to to um pass a law that's
 
01:43:30.109 --> 01:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
going to conflict with other statutes
 
01:43:32.270 --> 01:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
and that and hence my recommendation I
 
01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
also heard last night that Prime sponsor
 
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
of this amend of this legislation is um
 
01:43:41.470 --> 01:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
amenable to the itl motion from what I
 
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
recall uh from last night uh any
 
01:43:47.470 --> 01:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
discussion at all on this
 
01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
motion uh representative Lon uh thank
 
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair chman um yes the prime
 
01:43:54.189 --> 01:43:54.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill uh believes that
 
01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
this bill and other efforts were part of
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
the understanding that um that there
 
01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
were some challenges in the Unos organ
 
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
organ Network and um so this whole
 
01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
process has changed there's some work
 
01:44:07.270 --> 01:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
being done at the federal level which
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
may lead to more Equitable um
 
01:44:10.990 --> 01:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
distribution of organs so he believes
 
01:44:13.229 --> 01:44:13.239 align:start position:0%
that this bill should be ited but the
 
01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
fact that we discussed about it was very
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
very helpful so he thanks everybody for
 
01:44:17.119 --> 01:44:19.270 align:start position:0%
very helpful so he thanks everybody for
their

01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:44:21.790 --> 01:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
time any other the discussion yes
 
01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:23.470 align:start position:0%
time any other the discussion yes
representative

01:44:23.470 --> 01:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr chair I think this
 
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
bill was uh trying uh to address some
 
01:44:35.550 --> 01:44:35.560 align:start position:0%
real problems that uh we don't have
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
enough organs uh uh for organ donations
 
01:44:43.790 --> 01:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
and uh anything we can do to stimulate
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
it uh we should do while balancing
 
01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
balancing with possible
 
01:44:52.189 --> 01:44:52.199 align:start position:0%
abuse uh uh one point of data we
 
01:44:54.109 --> 01:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
received when we were working on this
 
01:44:57.550 --> 01:44:57.560 align:start position:0%
bill uh is that the number of kidney
 
01:45:01.390 --> 01:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
transfers in New Hampshire is not going
 
01:45:06.189 --> 01:45:06.199 align:start position:0%
down um but um um one point of that is
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
that we did not receive with quality
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
because quantity is very important but
 
01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
quality uh too because sometimes in this
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
process uh the same organ are being
 
01:45:22.350 --> 01:45:22.360 align:start position:0%
offered uh to to different uh let's say
 
01:45:23.870 --> 01:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
states to different medical
 
01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
organizations and um uh if let's say
 
01:45:33.229 --> 01:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
kidney like uh if it's low quality it
 
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
would need to be replaced sooner than uh
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
we would uh like it to be uh so some
 
01:45:44.589 --> 01:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
opionions of this bill were saying that
 
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh it will be immoral to deny some
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
people uh if um but uh that's what
 
01:45:56.910 --> 01:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
happening uh we we live in a world where
 
01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
resources are scar including organ
 
01:46:04.750 --> 01:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
transplants so and there's uh uh the
 
01:46:07.709 --> 01:46:07.719 align:start position:0%
current legal framework doesn't allow
 
01:46:11.550 --> 01:46:11.560 align:start position:0%
Market to regulate this scarcity so we
 
01:46:13.149 --> 01:46:13.159 align:start position:0%
are left to
 
01:46:15.589 --> 01:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
arbitrary uh
 
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
decisions why why it's important like
 
01:46:21.790 --> 01:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
for example some unhealthy habits let's
 
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
say um let's say some State like
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
indulges more in in drug abuse like uh
 
01:46:33.950 --> 01:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
can can it be adjusted when deciding who
 
01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
is a higher priority in the line usually
 
01:46:41.189 --> 01:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
not but we can have the opposite problem
 
01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
with some drug
 
01:46:47.149 --> 01:46:47.159 align:start position:0%
hesitancy uh let's say New Hampshire has
 
01:46:51.109 --> 01:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
high hesitancy when uh it takes to
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
people uh
 
01:46:56.430 --> 01:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
taking what I see an effective drug that
 
01:47:00.149 --> 01:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
is called Co vaccine and we have some
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
cases like Daniel coas of New Hampshire
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
he was on on this organ donation line uh
 
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
but he made personal decision not to
 
01:47:13.790 --> 01:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
take the drug that is called coid
 
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine and decision was made uh to
 
01:47:21.910 --> 01:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
remove him from organ Nation waiting
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
list and now he's dead so yeah it's an
 
01:47:29.070 --> 01:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
important issue of life and death this
 
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
bill as was told before me uh maybe it
 
01:47:35.870 --> 01:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
will conflict with other laws maybe it
 
01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
not but uh we don't have all the data to
 
01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
support it uh so uh I'm fine with it
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
tailing it but I urge you to continue
 
01:47:48.189 --> 01:47:48.199 align:start position:0%
looking into other ways how can we solve
 
01:47:53.070 --> 01:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh organ shortage issues and improve
 
01:47:55.629 --> 01:47:55.639 align:start position:0%
the situation thank
 
01:47:57.390 --> 01:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%

discussion see no other discussion okay

we'll put that on the consent
 
01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
calendar okay the final uh piece of
 
01:49:13.109 --> 01:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
legislation for us to consider this
 
01:49:15.510 --> 01:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
morning uh is SB
 
01:49:18.270 --> 01:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
236 relative to establishing a committee
 
01:49:20.589 --> 01:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
to study nonprofit organizations
 
01:49:22.510 --> 01:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
Contracting for the Department of Health
 
01:49:24.990 --> 01:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
and Human Services for children's
 
01:49:28.189 --> 01:49:28.199 align:start position:0%
services I'm I will move on to pass for
 
01:49:31.310 --> 01:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
that that bill uh the subcommittee is
 
01:49:33.870 --> 01:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
comprised of myself um representative
 
01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
kushman representative Weber
 
01:49:37.709 --> 01:49:37.719 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter upam and
 
01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative tez we heard from the
 
01:49:42.830 --> 01:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Insurance who was
 
01:49:46.109 --> 01:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
supportive of it and um again it's a
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
study committee and um you know
 
01:49:51.070 --> 01:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Insurance spel uh spoke at
 
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
length about um what they could see as a
 
01:49:57.270 --> 01:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
very valuable uh aspect to this so for
 
01:49:58.709 --> 01:49:58.719 align:start position:0%
that reason the committee voted
 
01:50:00.109 --> 01:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
unanimously subcommittee voted
 
01:50:02.910 --> 01:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
unanimously to recommend it um for us
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
for our passage this morning I would
 
01:50:06.229 --> 01:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
second the
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
motion yes okay thank you representative
 
01:50:16.950 --> 01:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.709 --> 01:50:19.719 align:start position:0%
Weber the only thing I would like to add
 
01:50:23.310 --> 01:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
is that this is really an incredibly
 
01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
difficult problem because it deals with
 
01:50:30.430 --> 01:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
the it the bill sounds like it's very
 
01:50:33.149 --> 01:50:33.159 align:start position:0%
broad but it really very much deals with
 
01:50:36.910 --> 01:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
the children who are receiving Services
 
01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
through um organizations that contract
 
01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:40.750 align:start position:0%
through um organizations that contract
with

01:50:40.750 --> 01:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:50:44.350 --> 01:50:44.360 align:start position:0%
DCF these are our most vulnerable kids
 
01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
the kids who need the most
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
services and the problem is that the
 
01:50:52.350 --> 01:50:52.360 align:start position:0%
organiz ations who arrange for the
 
01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
services like Waypoint and Easter Seals
 
01:50:58.270 --> 01:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
and the others um are finding that the
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
cost of insurance for running the
 
01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
programs is rapidly getting to the point
 
01:51:05.950 --> 01:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
where they are going to have to drop the
 
01:51:08.830 --> 01:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
programs and that would be exceedingly
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunate because these are kids that
 
01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:16.679 align:start position:0%
need help need help here and need help
 
01:51:20.069 --> 01:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
in the least restrictive environments
 
01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
that we can find that will appropriately
 
01:51:26.350 --> 01:51:26.360 align:start position:0%
deal with whatever trauma or issues that
 
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
they are dealing with so um getting it
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
studied and and trying to find an issue
 
01:51:33.310 --> 01:51:33.320 align:start position:0%
a way of dealing with that particular
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
issue is particularly important and I
 
01:51:36.669 --> 01:51:36.679 align:start position:0%
think the
 
01:51:40.189 --> 01:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative
 
01:51:43.550 --> 01:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes thank you Mr chairman I I um
 
01:51:46.229 --> 01:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
know that there's a lot of resistance to
 
01:51:48.870 --> 01:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
um creating study committees and I've
 
01:51:51.870 --> 01:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
been on a at least one study committee
 
01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
that was incredibly broad um and
 
01:51:58.709 --> 01:51:58.719 align:start position:0%
impossible to really study in full and
 
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
this seems to be an issue that's um
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
really perfect for a study committee
 
01:52:05.550 --> 01:52:05.560 align:start position:0%
because it's extremely the task is
 
01:52:08.589 --> 01:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
extremely narrow and um whether they
 
01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
solve the issue or not I think it's one
 
01:52:14.030 --> 01:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
that can be studied in a concise amount
 
01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
of time and um I'm wrong about this uh
 
01:52:20.109 --> 01:52:20.119 align:start position:0%
one of the things we suggested as a
 
01:52:22.350 --> 01:52:22.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee was that when the report is
 
01:52:25.390 --> 01:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
written it is written to suggest that of
 
01:52:27.870 --> 01:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
the uh house members of the study
 
01:52:32.189 --> 01:52:32.199 align:start position:0%
committee that um one a minimum of one I
 
01:52:34.069 --> 01:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
I think there are only two from from the
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
house but I could be wrong about that
 
01:52:38.069 --> 01:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
but one from Health and Human Services
 
01:52:40.510 --> 01:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
and one from Commerce because those are
 
01:52:42.189 --> 01:52:42.199 align:start position:0%
the areas of expertise that are
 
01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
particularly needed that is correct and
 
01:52:46.589 --> 01:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
when I did the committee report and sent
 
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
it to committee Services I mentioned
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
that recommendation thank you I specifi
 
01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:52.390 align:start position:0%
that recommendation thank you I specifi
that

01:52:52.390 --> 01:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:55.550 --> 01:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation other
 
01:52:58.430 --> 01:52:58.440 align:start position:0%

yes 20 to zero okay thank you once again
 
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
we will put that on the consent calendar
 
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
if that there was no
 
01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
objection again please myself included
 
01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
we need to get our committee reports in
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
and again we uh if we get them in in the
 
01:54:13.470 --> 01:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
next two or three days that would be
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
great uh representative Lon would um
 
01:54:18.870 --> 01:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
next um Monday we've talked about having
 
01:54:22.350 --> 01:54:22.360 align:start position:0%
our executive session begin at 10: but
 
01:54:25.390 --> 01:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
um uh the subcommittee for 378 would
 
01:54:28.669 --> 01:54:28.679 align:start position:0%
like to meet at 10:00 a.m. and then so
 
01:54:30.069 --> 01:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
that would mean the executive session
 
01:54:31.229 --> 01:54:31.239 align:start position:0%
would begin at
 
01:54:34.750 --> 01:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
10:30 uh so I'd like to notice that now
 
01:54:37.149 --> 01:54:37.159 align:start position:0%
and that'll be reflected in the calendar
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
also chair yes representative Merchant I
 
01:54:43.069 --> 01:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
think there's also an amendment I'd like
 
01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
to have the sub committee for the vision
 
01:54:48.109 --> 01:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
580 so if we could actually meet at
 
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
10:00 amongst us
 
01:54:53.550 --> 01:54:53.560 align:start position:0%
um before that to go over the amendment
 
01:54:56.310 --> 01:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
okay so the sub committee for 580 580 at
 
01:54:57.629 --> 01:54:57.639 align:start position:0%
10 o00 as well all right so the
 
01:55:00.109 --> 01:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for 580 and 378 they'll
 
01:55:03.030 --> 01:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
both be meeting at 10:00 a.m. next
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
Monday and again the executive session
 
01:55:08.109 --> 01:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:11.149 --> 01:55:11.159 align:start position:0%
10:30 other yes representative Murray
 
01:55:12.669 --> 01:55:12.679 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I only just noticed you
 
01:55:16.350 --> 01:55:16.360 align:start position:0%
know being new here um it says with um
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
SB 236 the date is November 1st 2023 did
 
01:55:22.510 --> 01:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
that get
 
01:55:25.589 --> 01:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
changed for submitting the report honor
 
01:55:33.189 --> 01:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
2023 I don't know we could handle that
 
01:55:38.430 --> 01:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
with a floor Amendment a friendly floor
 
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment or if um if cens this is on
 
01:55:43.149 --> 01:55:43.159 align:start position:0%
consent perhaps we may want to
 
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
reconsider the vote so we can just have
 
01:55:46.229 --> 01:55:46.239 align:start position:0%
a floor Amendment and put it on to
 
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
consent I'm not sure what would be the
 
01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
fastest approach probably be an even
 
01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
better idea representative and I
 
01:55:54.870 --> 01:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
certainly would go along with that okay
 
01:55:57.550 --> 01:55:57.560 align:start position:0%
so if we could get a floor Amendment for
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
next week just to change that date
 
01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
basically push it out a year push it out
 
01:56:06.189 --> 01:56:06.199 align:start position:0%
a year okay if they want to report
 
01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:09.719 align:start position:0%
sooner it's not not no harm no foul but
 
01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
and then to keep our paperwork straight
 
01:56:13.990 --> 01:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
should um should somebody like myself
 
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
move to reconsider now then vote to
 
01:56:18.430 --> 01:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
reconsider and then recess this until
 
01:56:20.109 --> 01:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
next week would that be the cleanest way
 
01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
to move forward to allow this to go on
 
01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
to consent then I will move to
 
01:56:26.950 --> 01:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
reconsider the vote on Senate Bill 236
 
01:56:29.069 --> 01:56:29.079 align:start position:0%
with great thanks to representative
 
01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
