Justice thank
 
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
you as I said yesterday we're going to
 
00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 align:start position:0%
today we're going to be working on the
 
00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 align:start position:0%
list of crimes that has been proposed to
 
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
be non PR
 
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 align:start position:0%
bailable um specifically SP
 
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
252 I believe the other Senate Bill
 
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
deals with the same thing but we'll look
 
00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
minute so what we're going to do is
 
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to go down the list um as a
 
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm going to open it up
 
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
for discussion on each of these crimes
 
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
and everyone please feel free to weigh
 
00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
in on whether you think this should or
 
00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 align:start position:0%
should not be eligible for PR
 
00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 align:start position:0%
bail before I do though I would like to
 
00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 align:start position:0%
hear from
 
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
um the Manchester police chief who might
 
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
help us in our
 
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
deliberations as we um discuss these
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 align:start position:0%
Chief someone's going to give you a copy
 
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
of that bill that has I have it in front
 
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
of me oh you have it okay thank you
 
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
you yeah I don't want to get into um I
 
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
think I've been here before chairman uh
 
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
in offer Dan doen off other other datter
 
00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
and um I think what I would say is you
 
00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
know law enforcement but more
 
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
importantly uh the communities at large
 
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
across the state of New Hampshire um
 
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
something needs to flex U something
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
needs to change I'm not a proponent of
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
putting everybody into jail
 
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily I don't think that's the
 
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
right method um but I will tell you that
 
00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
um I'll give you one quick statistic
 
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
from May of 2022 to August of this year
 
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
the Manchester police department has
 
00:06:58.589 --> 00:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
made just under 5,800 arrests of those
 
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
arrests 1,500 just over 1500 had active
 
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
bail conditions at the time of the
 
00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:05.479 align:start position:0%
arrest now those could have been bail
 
00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
conditions from anywhere across the
 
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 align:start position:0%
state um what the data needs to be next
 
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
dive in on the data needs to be how many
 
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
of those people were uh previously
 
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
arrested for a violent offense perhaps
 
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
the ones that El listed in this bill and
 
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
how many reoffended with the violent
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
offense um so I think we owe that to
 
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
this committee we owe that to um at
 
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
least from the Manchester side to
 
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
provide that to you so that that data is
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
being put together now because I think
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
that will offer a little bit more
 
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
perspective um but again we're talking
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
about the quality of life across the
 
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I think it's no
 
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
secret in Manchester that it's um it's
 
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
deteriorated um because a lot of people
 
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
that continue to reoffend and reoffend
 
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
and reoffend um where these people were
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
out on bail what we started doing why
 
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
the data starts in that a um May of last
 
00:07:54.149 --> 00:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
year is when we arrest people we now
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
have a spot on our arrest report are you
 
00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
currently out on bail so the individual
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
is self-reporting and I I think this
 
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
committee's talked about before kind of
 
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
synchronizing that system across the
 
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
state so that we know where somebody
 
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
actually is out on bail um and I think
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
that's been brought up before I think
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
that would be very helpful to law
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement I think it would be very
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
helpful to the courts um so that we have
 
00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:16.039 align:start position:0%
a true understanding of where somebody
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
is out on bail when they reoffend so we
 
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
can notify that agency um so they can
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
take the appropriate steps if they
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
choose to do so um but again you know
 
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
get to the ground truth ladies and
 
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
gentlemen um I'm out there my men and
 
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
women are out there every day dealing
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
with people who have reoffended and
 
00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
reoffended um it's it's quite frankly
 
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
it's getting old for my police office
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
it's getting old for the community that
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
I that I serve in and a lot of these
 
00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
people that are reoffending will will
 
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
tell you if you get out and have
 
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
conversations with them that they're not
 
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
getting help for their substance abuse
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
they're not getting help for their
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
mental health and they're not getting
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
help towards employment um all things
 
00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
that are real and that law enforcement
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't turn a blind eye to we fully
 
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
understand the substance abuse issue
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
trust me we fully understand the mental
 
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
health issue but these people will tell
 
00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:07.959 align:start position:0%
you that they're not getting the help
 
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
they need and they being in jail is at
 
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
least a start on a path to getting well
 
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully um sure there's Street
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
Outreach that takes place there's many
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
nonprofits out there doing work but when
 
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
people are dealing with mental health
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
and substance abuse then you're you know
 
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:25.240 align:start position:0%
lack of a better ter lack of a better
 
00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
term you're turning and burning them out
 
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:29.320 align:start position:0%
of a police department or out of a out
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
of a court on some type of low bail or
 
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
PR bail for multiple re offenses um that
 
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
they're not going to they're not going
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
to be in position to get themselves help
 
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
and really at the end of the day I think
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's what we all want is to help
 
00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
people but the current system frankly is
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
not designed it's not getting the people
 
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
the help that they need um I'll give you
 
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions you may have but
 
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
I think this bill that's in front of you
 
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
certainly these are egregious offenses
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
that people should at least be held for
 
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
a short period of time until they can
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
get in front of a judge and let the
 
00:09:59.790 --> 00:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
judge make the decision
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
um I think sometimes um you know we ask
 
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
our bail Commissioners to do a lot um
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
they're great in the city of Manchester
 
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that but I'll go a little
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
step further they need to get paid all
 
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
right they need to get paid ladies and
 
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:15.959 align:start position:0%
gentlemen um whatever that mechanism is
 
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
when I'm calling these people in at 2
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
3:00 in the morning Christmas morning
 
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
every holiday you can think of every
 
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
inconvenient time and then not being
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
compensated um this doesn't seem like
 
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
the American way to me so I'll end with
 
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.110 align:start position:0%
the American way to me so I'll end with
that

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Chief uh I I have a few
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
questions it seems to me um back in the
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
day if you were
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
arrested no one from a police department
 
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
would call a bail commissioner unless
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
you had the bail money present um would
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
that in your mind if if if regardless of
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
you end up on PR bail or not you had to
 
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:53.240 align:start position:0%
come up with the $40 to pay the bail
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
commissioner for that service do you
 
00:10:56.629 --> 00:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
think that that would change things in
 
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you um I think there
 
00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:09.959 align:start position:0%
probably be some legalities around that
 
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:11.240 align:start position:0%
I think that's a dangerous road to go
 
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
down that hey if you don't have 40 bucks
 
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
on you we're not going to allow you to
 
00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:14.839 align:start position:0%
see a bail commission there's probably
 
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
some constitutionality issues there I'm
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
sure my friends in the in the room would
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh probably agree um
 
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah did that maybe happen in the
 
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
past I'm not sure I don't have any
 
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
experience with that but yeah if so if
 
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
the def
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't have $40 then generally in the
 
00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:34.639 align:start position:0%
past they would go to court and some
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
judges at Manchester District Court
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
would make arrangements for them to you
 
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
know come up with the $40 um but I think
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of time you know they
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
don't present the 40 at the time of bail
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner gives them an envelope
 
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
hey please pay me please pay me um as a
 
00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:53.959 align:start position:0%
baill commission in the room he can
 
00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:55.240 align:start position:0%
probably give the percentage of the time
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
he receives payment back probably pretty
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
low yeah we heard testimony in that
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
yesterday and it it was extremely low
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
right um with regard to the reoffending
 
00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:08.839 align:start position:0%
um this list of crimes that we're
 
00:12:08.839 --> 00:12:10.269 align:start position:0%
um this list of crimes that we're
looking

00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
looking
 
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:13.720 align:start position:0%
at could you tell us what the majority
 
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
or category of the crimes that these
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
folks keep getting picked up on I'm
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
assuming it's not this list of of very
 
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
dangerous uh violent crimes yeah well I
 
00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
tell you the city of Manchester um you
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
know homicides are what they right I
 
00:12:30.269 --> 00:12:30.279 align:start position:0%
mean why we know what our homicide rate
 
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
is but obvious I think that's a
 
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
no-brainer um you have first degree
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
assault second degree assault uh
 
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
domestic violence afsa um FSA um
 
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
kidnappings um we we do get a rash of
 
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
those um you know stalking human
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
trafficking I mean all of these are
 
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
applicable in the city of Manchester um
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
and probably applicable across the state
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I just have a greater
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
volume of them um so yeah I think this
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
is this is is a start and it's
 
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:01.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate start but I think we need to
 
00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
keep having the conversation about these
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
people that are continuing to
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
reoffend definitely that are not on this
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
list my question I guess was what I'm
 
00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:12.519 align:start position:0%
trying to get is are are you seeing bail
 
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
Commissioners releasing people on these
 
00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
crimes um yes I am
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
okay does anyone else have any questions
 
00:13:23.949 --> 00:13:23.959 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
chief um yes uh representative follow up
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
to the question that chairman Roy just
 
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
asked how many approximately would you
 
00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
say are violent crimes that are being
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
led out by Bell Commissioners I think
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the next dive into
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
the data that we would owe this
 
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
committee um from the Manchester side um
 
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
so I had somebody sted working on that
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
this morning um and we won't take long
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
to to glean that data but I don't want
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
to give you an answer that may be wrong
 
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
so we will get that back I commit to get
 
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:07.839 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that you you said
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
is being in jail uh is at least a start
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
and one of the things I think that we've
 
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:19.720 align:start position:0%
heard consistently in this committee uh
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
from folks who maintain and manage the
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
county jails is essentially how under
 
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
resource and under staff they are when
 
00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:29.079 align:start position:0%
it comes to actually dealing with mental
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
health and substance abuse so um I I'm
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering um what kind of a
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
start is Jail uh in in your mind uh for
 
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
somebody who is
 
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
rearrested um and may be rearrested for
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
similar crimes over and over again um
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
what kind of a start does it provide it
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
could be part of their plea agreement
 
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0%
sir that um hey you you've agreed to
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
plead to this particular crime for you
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
know x amount of time in in the county
 
00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
facility and part of your conditions are
 
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
that you enroll in substance abuse that
 
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
you get Mount to health counseling um
 
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
some you know some communitybased
 
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
corrections if you will and that would
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
then to effectively monitor these people
 
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
upon release um so there's some type of
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
accountability or at least checks and
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
balance because quite frankly sir what
 
00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:20.839 align:start position:0%
happens is people are released from jail
 
00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:22.959 align:start position:0%
and in my city there you know the door
 
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:25.160 align:start position:0%
opens on Willow Street and and out they
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
go and and that's not really fair to the
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
individual um because a lot of these
 
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
people do want help um but when the when
 
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
to your point resources are limited um
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps Staffing is we all have staffing
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
issues in every Walk of Life right now
 
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
right so I don't really accept that we
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
got to find a way just like I have to
 
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
find a way every day um but just to open
 
00:15:48.189 --> 00:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
the door and release these people with
 
00:15:51.069 --> 00:15:51.079 align:start position:0%
no real connections or no hey who do I
 
00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:52.839 align:start position:0%
contact who do I reach out to who's
 
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
going to check on me um we're we're
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
failing them as well um because again a
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
lot of them them want to get better and
 
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
I believe like many that the criminal
 
00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
justice system has a role in that other
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
than simply arresting people and putting
 
00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
them in jail um what you know I'm sure
 
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
the correction folks can come in here
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
and speak to the programs that they
 
00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
offer and how to properly connect with
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
these people and how to properly track
 
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
them so they're on a path to being well
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
and and decreasing the Harms in our
 
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:25.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
you representative gath
 
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
I don't know if this is a question for
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
you but you mentioned that um I guess
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's not then you mentioned you
 
00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned that they would uh if they
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
have mental officials or drug abuse you
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
know they sort of want to be in jail and
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
this is their starting point I might
 
00:16:49.309 --> 00:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
understand that if it's a issue with
 
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
drugs but with mental health I'm not
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
understanding why that unless the jail
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
is given meds because if they're just
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
sitting in jail because we literally
 
00:17:03.629 --> 00:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
went to a hearing and listened to a man
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
asked to go to the mental health
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
facility and unfortunately could not be
 
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:11.720 align:start position:0%
released to do that so I'm just yeah I
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
guess that specific case but what I will
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
tell you representative is um people
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
that are struggling with mental health
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
um and say if they're homeless or say if
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
they're vast majority of time substance
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
abuse is on board as well unfortunately
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
um and when they're um released into the
 
00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:33.799 align:start position:0%
community without any type of connection
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
to back to the resources that are
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
available these people vanish or they go
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
to places that they're hard they're hard
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
to find and hard to connect them with
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
those resources because the greater
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Center of Manchester
 
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:49.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps had contact with them
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
reestablished that relationship upon
 
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
arrest or upon being a facility and then
 
00:17:56.149 --> 00:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
when they're released it's hard to
 
00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
maintain that connection because they go
 
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
back into wherever they came from
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's in the woods or at a
 
00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:05.799 align:start position:0%
homeless camp or again I'm not so we're
 
00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:08.039 align:start position:0%
sensitive to that but trying to keep
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
these people connected with the services
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
that are available is the challenge it's
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
very difficult for every every
 
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
discipline and I would imagine if
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
somebody's in a jail and they need to
 
00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
get into some type of mental health
 
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
counseling I I know that jails make
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
those arrangements to do
 
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
so and chief um if I could what type of
 
00:18:32.909 --> 00:18:32.919 align:start position:0%
services or liaison do you have with
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
mental health at your station do you
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
have a a worker or anyone like that
 
00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:40.039 align:start position:0%
who's there um for example during the
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
evenings when you're busiest yeah the
 
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis unit that's our main
 
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
conduit um between police department and
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
the Mental Health Center Greater
 
00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester so it could be 2 in the
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
morning that we have somebody in Mental
 
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
Health crisis the mobile crisis team
 
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
will respond with a clinician and peerto
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
peer um and hey oh this hey this
 
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
person's already a client let's get them
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
reconnected or this person's not a
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
client let's start getting him or her
 
00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
connected the best way that we
 
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
can is that a Manchester funded
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
organization that's a mobile crisis
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
teams are across the state so it's
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
funded by the Department of Health and
 
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
Human Services across the state the
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
funding I would I or controlled or
 
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
organized by yes
 
00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
yeah then they're they're they're tapped
 
00:19:27.549 --> 00:19:27.559 align:start position:0%
out they're going out of catchman areas
 
00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
and they're they're busy
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
yeah perpendicular to what chairman Roy
 
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
just asked are there what pre- trial
 
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:39.640 align:start position:0%
Services exist in the jail uh right now
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
for people who are incarcerated that for
 
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
the Hillsboro County it's called the ACT
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
program I can send you the literature on
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
that sir I can send it to this committee
 
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
um and that's a superintendent castano
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
who came from bar County um to Hillsboro
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
County was lacking pre-trial services at
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County House of Correction um
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
were essentially non-existent and
 
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
superintendent castano recognized that
 
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
having come from Mar County and he's
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
trying to get that get that right um
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
back to my point about every facet of
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
the Criminal Justice System having a
 
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:13.799 align:start position:0%
role in trying to do what we can for
 
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
these people because again I'm not a
 
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
proponent of just putting people in jail
 
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
and locking the door and tell them to
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
have a good day all right those I don't
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
think you're going to find any police
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
mentality well I would hope me phrase it
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
that way go ahead thank you Mr chairman
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I want
 
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
to go I want to go back to one of your
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
very first original statements when you
 
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
had given us the number of arrests and
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
then how many of those arrests were uh
 
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
people that had bail conditions that
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
that appeared to have been
 
00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
broken then you went to the people that
 
00:20:51.549 --> 00:20:51.559 align:start position:0%
were looking for help right Looking For
 
00:20:53.549 --> 00:20:53.559 align:start position:0%
assistance with the mental health or the
 
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
the substance abuse right do you know
 
00:20:59.070 --> 00:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
out of those people the 1500 that you
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned how many of those or in
 
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
opinion was receiving the treatment part
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
of the conditions that were given and if
 
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
one they just didn't follow through with
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
that themselves or was it a lack of not
 
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
being able to provide what was ordered a
 
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
great question I don't have that data
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question um I would
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
think there's a a decent majority of
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
those people um
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
you know again there's a lot of
 
00:21:32.909 --> 00:21:32.919 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and Outreach you know doing
 
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
doing great work and trying to do more
 
00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:36.919 align:start position:0%
great work um but there's also a
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
population of those people that um no
 
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
matter what you offer them um in their
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
mind they're not at Rock Bottom yet um
 
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
so they're going to refuse the vast
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
majority of people that we deal with
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
every day on our Outreach that the
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
police department does along with the
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
fire department
 
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
um a good majority of those people will
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
refuse your services you know right to
 
00:22:02.909 --> 00:22:02.919 align:start position:0%
your face um okay but does that mean we
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
give up on them no um but how long they
 
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
are they going to be allowed to remain
 
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
in the community to cause further harm
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
um to businesses and and innocent people
 
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
where we eventually we got to draw a
 
00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
line and you got to you know these
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
people got to get help they're going to
 
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
continue to cause harm and that's the
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
balance right that's that's I think
 
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
that's the challenge may I have follow
 
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
up so ju just for clarification
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
you're you're not aware if if that was
 
00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
part of their part of the bill
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
conditions was just was to actually
 
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
receive this treatment you no but one
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
one standard Bill condition for
 
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
everybody is not to use illegal drugs or
 
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
excessive alcohol right so we know that
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
they've all that's a standard bail
 
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.149 align:start position:0%
they've all that's a standard bail
condition

00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
condition
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
so you know okay a lot of them are
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
violating that right out of the gate now
 
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
what they're head condition or part of
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
their agreement to to enroll in some
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
type of program and then could be drug
 
00:23:04.029 --> 00:23:04.039 align:start position:0%
court right MH um drug court has its
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
successes but there are some people that
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
I reoffend while in drug court and three
 
00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
or four or five times over um
 
00:23:15.269 --> 00:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
so I I would I would imagine to I would
 
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
hope that the courts would have that
 
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
information they could provide that to
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
you yeah thank you um Chief I if if
 
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
there were a a component that had
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
mandatory inhouse treatment as a
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
diversion to some of these people is are
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
you aware of even a place that could
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
handle the number of people that that
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
you see day in and day out in this state
 
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
in my County uh Hillsboro County I mean
 
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
I know that the population at the County
 
00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
facility is not what it what it was preo
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
uh their numbers are down substantially
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to speak to their
 
00:23:59.310 --> 00:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
population but um
 
00:24:02.269 --> 00:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
I know they can take in more people um
 
00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
and perhaps start connecting more people
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
with more services because again what's
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
happening right now on the streets is
 
00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.390 align:start position:0%
happening right now on the streets is
not

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
working and that's that's just a m
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
matter of general practice and living it
 
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
and seeing it every day of my life
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative Stone thank you Mr
 
00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:23.240 align:start position:0%
chairman chief from your experience
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
under the current bail system that we're
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
utilizing what's the impact on the
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
victims of some of these yeah a great
 
00:24:30.389 --> 00:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
Point yeah especially domestic violence
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
victims or any victim right a victim is
 
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
a victim um and now those are the people
 
00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
that we hear from quite a bit
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
representative of what do you mean he or
 
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
she got released you know especially if
 
00:24:42.669 --> 00:24:42.679 align:start position:0%
it was a some of these crimes that you
 
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
listed in this bill involving Firearms
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
or or stabbings um again I don't want to
 
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
give you anecdotes but you know last
 
00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
week had a riot of 10 people that
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
arrested um felony Riot first deegree
 
00:24:56.669 --> 00:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
assault um hope you know thankfully the
 
00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
the main aggressive was hell
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
um so that's good but yeah we hear from
 
00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
victims all the time um and I'll be
 
00:25:07.149 --> 00:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
frank with you what I'm telling them now
 
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
is to engage with your elected officials
 
00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
um and be vocal and speak to the people
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
that you're sending up to conquet on
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
your behalf um to to do the state's
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
business um because I can only do as
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
much as I can do the courts can do what
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
they can do but again I'm not looking
 
00:25:27.789 --> 00:25:27.799 align:start position:0%
for overwhelming change I'm looking for
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
this is a good start this is this is
 
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
kind of heading us back in the right
 
00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
direction and amongst all the other
 
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
things that a lot of other agencies are
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
doing to help people follow up real
 
00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:40.919 align:start position:0%
quick followup Chief since 2018 in the
 
00:25:42.669 --> 00:25:42.679 align:start position:0%
implementation of the new baill system
 
00:25:44.389 --> 00:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
do you feel that law enforcement hands
 
00:25:44.399 --> 00:25:47.110 align:start position:0%
do you feel that law enforcement hands
been

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
tied tied no because I we still have the
 
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
ability to enforce the laws right that
 
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
are on the books and we're doing that um
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
I think what you're seeing is um you
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
know we operate within the you know the
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
left and right limits of the of the
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
state laws what you're seeing is a
 
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
massive drain on the people that put on
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
this uniform um yes we signed up to do
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
this job but when you're dealing with
 
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
the same people over and over and over
 
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
it's hurting law enforcement it's
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
hurting you if you don't see what if you
 
00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
don't think when people consider being a
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer especially this
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
this generation now they do their
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
homework a lot more than perhaps I did
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
when I got on the job um they're paying
 
00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
attention they're paying attention to
 
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the state and what's
 
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
the what's the temperature and and you
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
know what are criminal behaviors what
 
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
are they getting away with or you know
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
how much are they being held accountable
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
um so I think really there's a sense of
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
especially in my community I 100%
 
00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
confident saying it that the temperature
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
in Manchester is that people are not
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
being held accountable for their
 
00:26:59.549 --> 00:26:59.559 align:start position:0%
criminal Behavior and that's the
 
00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
reality Chief a lot of what we hear in
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
the public hears is from the media um
 
00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's not exactly accurate
 
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh could you help there was a a case
 
00:27:13.389 --> 00:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
that we saw just a few weeks ago where
 
00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
there were two brothers arrested I
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
believe it was for a shooting in
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
Manchester and the judge let him go and
 
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
everybody was like how is that possible
 
00:27:23.669 --> 00:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
could you give us a little background if
 
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
you could on that case it's an open
 
00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
investigation so I that would be
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
slippery for me to to get into that um
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
but we do have people that have
 
00:27:33.149 --> 00:27:33.159 align:start position:0%
committed gun violence who have been um
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
no granted a superior court judge May
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
set a cash bill that the person is able
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
to meet okay then you know yeah but um
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
there have been cases where people have
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
committed violent offenses and have been
 
00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
um have been released on extremely low
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
bail or in some instances uh PR bail so
 
00:27:57.149 --> 00:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
in in your opinion if the district
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
attorney had the ability to appeal which
 
00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
they currently do but they don't appear
 
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of it very often
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
because the offender is already gone at
 
00:28:07.509 --> 00:28:07.519 align:start position:0%
the door I think um Mr Shear brought
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
this up before I do agree with him in
 
00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
terms of revoking people's bail um yes
 
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
that happens at the district court level
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
um and but at the superior court level
 
00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
um at least in Hillsboro County the
 
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
county attorney's office or an assistant
 
00:28:23.389 --> 00:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
County attorney has to file the motion
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
to violate the person's bail um so yes
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
we provide them with the report and the
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
information and say Hey you know Alan
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
aldenberg was out on bail out of
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
Superior Court he reoffended on a
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
violent offense you know hey filed the
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
motion um I think that's a great
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
question for the County attorneys in
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
those cases how many times are they
 
00:28:48.669 --> 00:28:48.679 align:start position:0%
exercising what's currently available to
 
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
them yeah um to go ahead and do that um
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
I'll be frank I mean I'll had a
 
00:28:56.909 --> 00:28:56.919 align:start position:0%
conversation with an assistant County
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
attorney one of my people did a couple
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
weeks ago and he was not even
 
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
aware that he could appear he could do
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
that right so that's concerning yeah all
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
right um and I I think that's probably
 
00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
Mr shear and I agree maybe we is he
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
nodding his head I don't know um well
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
what I was getting at is also what
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
if if a judge says okay I'm going to let
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
someone go on one of these crimes on PR
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
or extremely low
 
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
bail it because with the the change from
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
felonies first everything's going to end
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
up back in the district court originally
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
sure is and if the district court just
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
says okay
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
PR and the district attorney had the
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
ability to appeal to the superior court
 
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
and as part of that the person would be
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
held until the
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
appeal versus just walking out of the
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
district court with that do you think be
 
00:29:54.509 --> 00:29:54.519 align:start position:0%
help I I mean once that case is you know
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
once felon's first and goes in effect
 
00:29:59.509 --> 00:29:59.519 align:start position:0%
goes back to district court and you have
 
00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
that probable cause hearing at district
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
court and that the judge find probable
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
cause the case will be bound over to
 
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:06.200 align:start position:0%
Superior Court um so the whole case goes
 
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
there um you
 
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
know I would I would defer an attorney
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
on that if they would then want to you
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
know argue for a bail hearing um but
 
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
usually requests for bail hearings come
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
from defense counsel um to have the
 
00:30:23.549 --> 00:30:23.559 align:start position:0%
baill changed okay all right yeah the
 
00:30:25.389 --> 00:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
Felon first thing is going to be
 
00:30:27.549 --> 00:30:27.559 align:start position:0%
interesting that's a whole another topic
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
yeah one one thing at a time any further
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
questions represent wheeler first of all
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
Chief aldenberg thank you for your time
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
and your testimony um can you ensure
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
that the data that you compile around
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
people getting re arrested uh
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
distinguishes between judges who have
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
released them and the bail Commissioners
 
00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:48.679 align:start position:0%
who have released them I can certainly
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
do my best thank you um again I think I
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
think the tracking system at the courts
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
needs to be needs to be enhanced I think
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
we try that last year I believe or um
 
00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:01.799 align:start position:0%
because that would really so that we're
 
00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
all on the same page on one system I
 
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
know it's going to take a while to to
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
get that to where it needs to be but
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
then that would provide you with you
 
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
would be able to get that in in real
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
time I would believe in in the future
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
because those are those are those are
 
00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
great questions absolutely Y and
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
thankfully chair I would want to know it
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
too yeah thankfully chairman Roy is
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
really passionate about upgrading the
 
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
system so hopefully we'll get that done
 
00:31:25.389 --> 00:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
and I would assume the information that
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
you have is going to be pre-arranging
 
00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
anyway you are you tracking these cases
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
all through all through the no all the
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
stuff is uh is pre-arraignment
 
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm pretty confident I'm very
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
confident in our our system and our
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
numbers yeah thank you Chief so I think
 
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
what I owe this committee at some point
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman is um the deeper dive on
 
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
those 1500 I mentioned um if you would
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
like that absolutely I mean that's a
 
00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
startling number of 1500 out of 58 that
 
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:55.240 align:start position:0%

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I
 
00:33:37.789 --> 00:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:40.629 --> 00:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
was boy that's unusual for
 
00:33:40.639 --> 00:33:42.509 align:start position:0%
was boy that's unusual for
me

00:33:42.509 --> 00:33:42.519 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:33:42.519 --> 00:33:45.430 align:start position:0%
me
um

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
um a couple preliminary points number
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
one uh the bail
 
00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
system has never been designed nor
 
00:33:59.629 --> 00:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
should be designed to hold people
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
accountable for their crimes that's what
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
the subsequent criminal justice system
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
is about I appreciate uh the immense
 
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
difficulties that victims uh of crimes
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh suffer uh and how how hard it is
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
for them in so many different
 
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances but I think uh anyone who
 
00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
represents to a victim of the crime that
 
00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
the bail
 
00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
system will make sure that uh the person
 
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
who's alleged to have committed the
 
00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
crime will hold them accountable it's
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
it's they're misrepresenting that to a
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
victim the the criminal legal system as
 
00:34:43.069 --> 00:34:43.079 align:start position:0%
a whole is designed to hold people
 
00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
accountable but not the bail system at
 
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
the front end and and that uh I
 
00:34:49.869 --> 00:34:49.879 align:start position:0%
understand people's
 
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
frustration uh that uh accountability is
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
not as doesn't happen as quickly as it
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
should um in many circumstances but uh
 
00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
that's not because of problems with the
 
00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:07.079 align:start position:0%
bail system that's because of problems
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
with other parts of the Criminal Justice
 
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
System uh and uh the resources that are
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
in place um so uh Point number one point
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
number two uh I I appreciate Chief
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
aldenberg comments uh that uh about uh
 
00:35:26.349 --> 00:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
those uh who are struggling with
 
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
substance AB issues or mental health
 
00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
issues it's really the bail system has
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
never been designed nor does it
 
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
particularly work
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
well to uh address those issues as a
 
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
part of the system you know the bail
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
system as a constitutional matter has
 
00:35:50.589 --> 00:35:50.599 align:start position:0%
always been viewed as uh having two
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
purposes one uh to protect the public uh
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
from dangerous people uh while a charge
 
00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.430 align:start position:0%
from dangerous people uh while a charge
is

00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
pending um and two to make sure they
 
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
show up for court a lot of you know
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
there's an infinite variety of bail
 
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
systems across the United States and um
 
00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
they all you almost all of them try and
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
do it a different way you know there's
 
00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.710 align:start position:0%
do it a different way you know there's
there's

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:19.720 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
51 uh different bail systems in the
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
United States the federal system and the
 
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
50 states plus there's uh tribal Juris
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
addtions who have their own system so um
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
I think there are uh counties in New
 
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for example straford County
 
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
which has a lot of resources because
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
they h house and get paid for housing a
 
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
lot of federal inmates they have a very
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
sophisticated uh pre-trial Services
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
Program where a judge can say well I'm
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
going to let you out on pale you need to
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
engage in this system in this way and
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
that way and those are those tend to be
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh much more
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
effective uh than counties without uh
 
00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
formal pre-trial Services um it's it you
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
know I won't say uh it's I think it's
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
obvious why um but when when it's a
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
county that's trying to piece together
 
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
ways to deal with those who are mentally
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
ill or suffer from mental health issues
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
or substance abuse issues or who are
 
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
homeless uh the baell system just
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't work well that way and and and I
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
understand uh the general Public's
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
concern Police Department's concerns or
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
what do we do with these people uh I
 
00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:44.839 align:start position:0%
just we've always struggled you know
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
I've been at this bail stuff since
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
2017 and we've always struggled with how
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
to deal with those societal issues uh um
 
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
and how much we really can ask of a bail
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
system to to deal in you know in an
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
immediate sense or certainly not a
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
long-term sense with homelessness with
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
uh uh those struggling with mental
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
health issues those with substance abuse
 
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
problem I think you know most people who
 
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
deal with homelessness know uh and try
 
00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
and address those issues uh know that um
 
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
and all the re Arch says this also that
 
00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
the most important thing to deal with
 
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
with homelessness is finding ways to
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
House people that's the key uh to
 
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
homelessness um obviously that doesn't
 
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
mean housing them in the jail um but um
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
so I make those two points in terms of
 
00:38:55.309 --> 00:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
the specific uh crimes uh I think that
 
00:39:00.309 --> 00:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
um the list that is in uh what was last
 
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
uh session the Susi bill which or that
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
which has been in the uh in past bills
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
put forward by uh Senator Bradley too
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
expansive you know I'm I'm an advocate
 
00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
of the list only
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
including uh
 
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
felonies um uh I I think that is uh um
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
that's a better
 
00:39:31.309 --> 00:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
system um it's it's less inclusive I
 
00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
think this committee has heard in the
 
00:39:36.309 --> 00:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
past from the court system when that
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
list includes
 
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors that means the court system
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
is going to have to deal with in short
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
term four to 5 th 3 to 4,000 more
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
hearings and it's a profound resource
 
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
drain on the court system that they
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
won't be able to handle
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
um so I think including misdemeanor on
 
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
that list of crimes is uh is a mistake
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
and it's a it's a mistake for resource
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
reasons you know some of the crimes that
 
00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
particularly when it's a misdemeanor
 
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
particularly when it's a person who's
 
00:40:15.309 --> 00:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
the first time they've committed a
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor it's very unlikely they're
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
going to get jail time uh on those
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
offenses and if they end up at the front
 
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
end being held pre-trial they're going
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
to end up serving time that they
 
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't serve if they were convicted
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
and sentenced on the case
 
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
um I also am an advocate of finding ways
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh and I I think the concern that uh the
 
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
police and Senator Bradley have
 
00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
expressed that gave rise to that list of
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
crimes in what's now Senator susi's Bill
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
before the
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
committee I think the A system that
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
solves that problem is one that gets
 
00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.349 align:start position:0%
solves that problem is one that gets
individuals

00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
uh in front of a judge quicker than the
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
current system
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
does um that
 
00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:11.079 align:start position:0%
way a system that uh uh has those crime
 
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
has a list of crimes for which the
 
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
person will not see a bail
 
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner um but they will see a and
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
they they they are held until they see a
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
judge that's a much more pal mble system
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh to me if they see a judge within 24
 
00:41:35.069 --> 00:41:35.079 align:start position:0%
hours whereas the way it is now if that
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
were to pass with that list you know
 
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
they if they're arrested on Friday
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
evening they're not going to see a judge
 
00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
at the earliest until Monday morning or
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
if it's a long weekend until Tuesday
 
00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:47.720 align:start position:0%
morning depending on the court
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
scheduling so you know I think that's
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
one of my fundamental problems with
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
grafting on that list of crimes to a
 
00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:57.640 align:start position:0%
system as the way in the way it works
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
now is people sit in jail too long on on
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances where they otherwise might
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
be released waiting to see a judge
 
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
because it's on those list of crimes if
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
we shorten that period of time to 24
 
00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:13.640 align:start position:0%
hours um then you know uh that list of
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
crimes uh is uh I think that list of
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
crimes with only felonies on it I think
 
00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
that's a palatable uh and manageable
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
list you know and I have in the ideal
 
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
world I have the bail system as I was
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
design it but you're not here to listen
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
to me talk about the ideal World
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
Professor if you could I don't mean
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
interrupt you but could you tell me
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
which on the list are misdemeanors um
 
00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:43.400 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the list do you have it I
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
do not have it in front of me from my
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
memory such as it is I believe Chief Al
 
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
is going to give it to you just an
 
00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.589 align:start position:0%
is going to give it to you just an
uncharacteristic

00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
uncharacteristic
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I will note for the record
 
00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
Chief halberg said he agreed with me on
 
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
something earlier we have that on tape
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate that we'll edit
 
00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
that please
 
00:43:05.599 --> 00:43:11.270 align:start position:0%
that please
do

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
um uh domestic violence some of them are
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors uh I believe some of the
 
00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
trafficking in persons can be
 
00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors uh I uh and I am uncertain
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh as to uh the uh computer pornography
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
and child exploitation um you know I
 
00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:37.720 align:start position:0%
I'll be uh
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
straightforward uh my list would be
 
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
homicides first degree assault second
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
degree assault felony domestic violence
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
aggravated felonia sexual assault
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
felonia sexual assault kidnapping felony
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
stalking stalking is another one that
 
00:43:58.109 --> 00:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
frequently is misdemeanor uh trafficking
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
in persons uh felony trafficking in
 
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
persons uh manufacturer of child sexual
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
abuse images uh I I would not put on
 
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
this list possession or
 
00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
distribution uh I think those are less
 
00:44:14.349 --> 00:44:14.359 align:start position:0%
inherently dangerous in the immediate
 
00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
sense you know if we release somebody
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
from on bail on possession of child
 
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse images I don't think uh
 
00:44:27.549 --> 00:44:27.559 align:start position:0%
there's any uh t able enough danger to
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
other people while that person is out on
 
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
bail that said manufacturing child
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse images certainly is a very
 
00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.430 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse images certainly is a very
dangerous

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
crime um and felony computer pornography
 
00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:43.480 align:start position:0%
and child exploitation so that's the
 
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:45.640 align:start position:0%
list that I would recommend to this
 
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
committee um I think that uh
 
00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
uh it would reduce the chance that
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
people will be held on crimes pre-trial
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't get jail time post
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
Tri uh post disposition of the hearing
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
post conviction assuming they're
 
00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:07.240 align:start position:0%
convicted number one and number two it
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
would reduce the cost uh to the court I
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
would add uh one more thing there is
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
some data out there that suggest that in
 
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
the research I've done and uh some
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
testimony I heard from both the court
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
system and the public defender program
 
00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
several years ago in a work a study
 
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
commit involving the office of Cost
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
Containment that collects poor people
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
from collects money from poor people who
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
are appointed counsel um uh there was
 
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
some evidence that somewhere between 25
 
00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.309 align:start position:0%
some evidence that somewhere between 25
and

00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
35% of all criminal cases uh in which
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
council is appointed end up being
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
dismissed so whatever this list
 
00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:57.160 align:start position:0%
contains and if it results in people
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
being held uh
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
pre-trial there's an uncomfortably large
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
number of people who are going to be
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
held for crimes that eventually will get
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
dismissed or for which they will be
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
found not guilty so that's another check
 
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
on how expensive we want to make this
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
list uh I appreciate that the
 
00:46:26.549 --> 00:46:26.559 align:start position:0%
concern should should be with this list
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of thinking about
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
dangerousness how dangerous are they
 
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
going to be while they're out on bail
 
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:39.640 align:start position:0%
until this case is disposed of it's not
 
00:46:42.309 --> 00:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
a more Cosmic is this person in general
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
a dangerous person it's while they're
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
out on ba the point of bail is are they
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
going to be dangerous to themselves or
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
others while they're out on bail with
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
this charge pending um so those are my
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
my thoughts on uh on this list more than
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
more than willing to answer
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um I I've got a
 
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
question it's not necessarily pertaining
 
00:47:08.589 --> 00:47:08.599 align:start position:0%
to the list but it's to the issue of
 
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
getting the bill Commissioners paid um
 
00:47:14.109 --> 00:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the office of Cost
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
Containment if a if a if a defendant
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
were released and it were ordered by the
 
00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
court for him or her to pay the for
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
$ first before any fines restitution or
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
anything else would the offs of Cost
 
00:47:34.589 --> 00:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
Containment be the ones who would go
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
after them for that or would that be the
 
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
court trying to maintain followup that
 
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
would be the court the office of Cost
 
00:47:43.549 --> 00:47:43.559 align:start position:0%
Containment statutorily is set up to
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
collect money from PE now from people
 
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
who have been convicted of crimes for
 
00:47:53.309 --> 00:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
which they had a lawyer appointed okay
 
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
um you know I I have my own concerns
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
about the office because the true nature
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
of the office is let's com collect money
 
00:48:03.309 --> 00:48:03.319 align:start position:0%
from poor people who've been appointed
 
00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:05.559 align:start position:0%
lawyers because they're poor uh you know
 
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
there's a certain measure of
 
00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
inconsistency with the whole idea behind
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
the office of cause containment separate
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
topic not for us to deal with um but
 
00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.910 align:start position:0%
topic not for us to deal with um but
uh

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
um I think it would be the the
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
court if they were
 
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
ordered by the court
 
00:48:28.109 --> 00:48:28.119 align:start position:0%
to pay the
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
$40 it would be up to the court to
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
enforce in some other in some fashion
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
whatever they choose uh the payment of
 
00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.109 align:start position:0%
whatever they choose uh the payment of
those

00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
$40 you
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
know I'll just add this uh not intending
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
to confuse the issue but it will you
 
00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
know there's an interesting moral
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
question of if somebody's arrested for a
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
crime they don't have the $40 they're
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
order to pay the $40 and the charge
 
00:48:59.349 --> 00:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
against them is later dismissed or
 
00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
they're found not guilty you know do we
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
want the system to still collect the 40
 
00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
bucks from them they're not the ones who
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
chose to be arrested and go in front of
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner it's an obligation
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
that it was imposed on them by the fact
 
00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
that they were
 
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
charged involving the charge that would
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
later go
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
away um you know there's there's a
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
inconsistency there that it's a wrinkle
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
that probably is worthy of attention but
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
yeah it be the court the short answer
 
00:49:29.549 --> 00:49:29.559 align:start position:0%
which I usually don't give is yes it
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
would be up to the court system I I I
 
00:49:33.549 --> 00:49:33.559 align:start position:0%
might agree if they were found not
 
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
guilty um dismissal doesn't by any
 
00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:38.839 align:start position:0%
stretch mean that they're not guilty and
 
00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
I think that it's a service that they're
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
availing themselves up correct me if I'm
 
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
wrong but there's no constitutional
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
right to bail there's only a
 
00:49:47.069 --> 00:49:47.079 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to not have
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
excessive bail so if that is correct
 
00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:52.799 align:start position:0%
they have the option to stay in jail if
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
they want till the morning if they Avail
 
00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
themselves of the service service it
 
00:49:58.109 --> 00:49:58.119 align:start position:0%
seems they should at some point have to
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
pay for it
 
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
um or is that did I just open a large
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional can of worms uh there's a
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
can of worms there and I won't address
 
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
the can of worms and we can we can fight
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
in some other context over with the
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
meaning of a dismissal you know some
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes a dismissal means the
 
00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
prosecutor looks at the case and says
 
00:50:24.589 --> 00:50:24.599 align:start position:0%
boy this is so bad a case I'm not going
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
to trial and risking getting a not
 
00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
guilty you know that kind of dismissal
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
is one thing if a dismissal that's a
 
00:50:33.309 --> 00:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
part of
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh multi-jurisdictional plea bargain
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's a whole another thing so oh let me
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
add one more thing you
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
know and I've raised this with some on
 
00:50:45.359 --> 00:50:46.910 align:start position:0%
know and I've raised this with some on
the

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
committee the police have the authority
 
00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:52.359 align:start position:0%
on misdemeanors and violations to
 
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
instead of arresting somebody and going
 
00:50:58.109 --> 00:50:58.119 align:start position:0%
through the bail commissioner process to
 
00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
the extent they do with misdemeanors
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
usually they don't with violations to
 
00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:05.799 align:start position:0%
summons the person to court rather than
 
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh to take them through uh the temporary
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
custody the arrest and um and a bail
 
00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh you know uh embedding in
 
00:51:20.349 --> 00:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
in the bail system a uh let's call it a
 
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
preference rather than make it mandatory
 
00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:25.720 align:start position:0%
but a preference in those in
 
00:51:28.349 --> 00:51:28.359 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors for the police to summons
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
that person to court rather than having
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
them have to go through the bail
 
00:51:35.309 --> 00:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner process uh might save
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
everybody time I mean there's some
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
potential downsides to that but um I um
 
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
I throw that out as as a something for
 
00:51:45.069 --> 00:51:45.079 align:start position:0%
the committee to think
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
about I worry that would that might end
 
00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
up though in just a a slew of default
 
00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
warrants because if someone's uh
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
homeless I don't know how they would get
 
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
their mail but it there is some
 
00:51:58.349 --> 00:51:58.359 align:start position:0%
something to think about I think in that
 
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
yeah you know I I the way I would set it
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
up is there would be a um uh when they
 
00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
were summons they would be summoned for
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
a particular court date the summons
 
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
itself which they would be given in hand
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
the police would have to coordinate with
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
the court system on this but have a list
 
00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:15.559 align:start position:0%
of court dates that people could be
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
summoned to for an arraignment on that
 
00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
uh on that misdemeanor then again the
 
00:52:21.789 --> 00:52:21.799 align:start position:0%
police would have an option depending on
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
the misdemeanor if they wanted to arrest
 
00:52:25.589 --> 00:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
a person and see a bail commissioner ask
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
for a a lack of of of uh you know to be
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
held without bail um you know that
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
option should be there still thank you
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
00:52:40.109 --> 00:52:40.119 align:start position:0%
scitec Mr chairman as I said before I'd
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
like to testify later but this is a
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
great opportunity when do I ever get the
 
00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
chance to add something to Professor
 
00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:49.640 align:start position:0%
Sher and that's this don't feel the
 
00:52:52.589 --> 00:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
obligation oh well I understand the
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
thing is that we will the police police
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
are aware of what you've said they don't
 
00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839 align:start position:0%
choose as you said to implement it but
 
00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
when it does come in why they want a
 
00:53:04.589 --> 00:53:04.599 align:start position:0%
bail sometimes is to you can't with a
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
Summons issue bail conditions so that's
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
why they like the bail process and and I
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
think um you could amend the current I
 
00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
59714 it's 59414 or I can't remember the
 
00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.230 align:start position:0%
59714 it's 59414 or I can't remember the
exact

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
exact
 
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
RS statute number I think you could
 
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
amend that to have with any summons for
 
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor uh to a future court date uh
 
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
a set of statutory conditions that
 
00:53:35.549 --> 00:53:35.559 align:start position:0%
accompanied accompanied the summons uh
 
00:53:35.559 --> 00:53:36.870 align:start position:0%
accompanied accompanied the summons uh
and

00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:41.549 --> 00:53:41.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
thought welcome to the bail
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
system uh representative
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
Muse um yeah first just uh just a
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
comment uh uh for the chief it would be
 
00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
enormously helpful if um that uh data
 
00:53:58.270 --> 00:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
that you're going to provide us actually
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
would somehow get correlated to the list
 
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
of crimes that are in uh s SP2 42 to
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
whatever extent is possible um that
 
00:54:09.789 --> 00:54:09.799 align:start position:0%
would really help us see where the the
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
biggest pain points are areas that maybe
 
00:54:16.829 --> 00:54:16.839 align:start position:0%
are are are less relevant um uh having
 
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:19.559 align:start position:0%
data like that and it's always really
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
hard for us to get data like that would
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
be enormously helpful as we uh try
 
00:54:28.109 --> 00:54:28.119 align:start position:0%
finalize the list um the the other thing
 
00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to ask you about is I know
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
one of the problems uh that uh has been
 
00:54:38.349 --> 00:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
kind of an ongoing issue with bills that
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
have listed these crimes is either the
 
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:45.640 align:start position:0%
written in uh wording that there is a
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
presumption of dangerousness or the the
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
fact even when you take the word out
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
there's a presumption of
 
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
dangerousness um does reducing the the
 
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
time that somebody can be held without
 
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
seeing a judge does that make basically
 
00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
make that issue go away so if it's less
 
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
than 24 hours if it's 24 hours or less
 
00:55:13.589 --> 00:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
substantially yeah it makes that issue
 
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
dissol relatively speaking dissolve um
 
00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:17.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:55:20.829 --> 00:55:20.839 align:start position:0%
constitutionally you can probably it's
 
00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward that you can hold
 
00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
someone certainly for at least 2 hours
 
00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:31.160 align:start position:0%
without having them see a judge um that
 
00:55:33.789 --> 00:55:33.799 align:start position:0%
uh so yes it does reduce that time so
 
00:55:35.549 --> 00:55:35.559 align:start position:0%
you know that's a that's an additional
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
benefit to reducing that time and of
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
course you know that's a conversation
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
with I think
 
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
as uh chair Roy had expressed you know
 
00:55:47.029 --> 00:55:47.039 align:start position:0%
that that merits a conversation with the
 
00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
court system thank you um Professor Shar
 
00:55:55.029 --> 00:55:55.039 align:start position:0%
just while I have you here one of the
 
00:55:57.309 --> 00:55:57.319 align:start position:0%
main issues we're going to be addressing
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
and and this applies to you from a more
 
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
you have experience in the research
 
00:56:04.349 --> 00:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
Department with our courts
 
00:56:08.349 --> 00:56:08.359 align:start position:0%
recently what do you think the need is
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
for us to just I mean I know they have
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
J1 and and some other systems of just
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
starting from scratch and implementing a
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
a a broad comprehensive it system that
 
00:56:23.549 --> 00:56:23.559 align:start position:0%
links the court the police probation
 
00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
parole everybody real time and finally
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
get us all where we need to be and would
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
be able to allow the public to come in
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
and make request for data that would
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
actually be accurate without having to
 
00:56:38.349 --> 00:56:38.359 align:start position:0%
go to every different courthouse in the
 
00:56:41.029 --> 00:56:41.039 align:start position:0%
State uh as I think as I said before
 
00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
this Committee in my efforts to
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes vain sometimes slightly less
 
00:56:49.789 --> 00:56:49.799 align:start position:0%
than vain to uh provide you know partial
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
data to the court best I can given the
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
difficulty that court system uh provides
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
in extracting any data from it I think
 
00:57:04.589 --> 00:57:04.599 align:start position:0%
it's essential for reasons related to
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
bail and for reasons related to other
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
parts of the the criminal legal system I
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
think we you know ever since I uh
 
00:57:16.349 --> 00:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
started thinking about bail and working
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
with many legislators and others about
 
00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
bail uh we always bump up against the
 
00:57:24.029 --> 00:57:24.039 align:start position:0%
lack of data problem because the court
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
system had is only a case management
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
software system it doesn't have a data
 
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
collection system and that's a
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
fundamental problem nor are any of those
 
00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
nor since they don't have a data
 
00:57:38.349 --> 00:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
collection system it's not connected to
 
00:57:41.069 --> 00:57:41.079 align:start position:0%
the to the police um or other
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
significant the court system the to to
 
00:57:47.789 --> 00:57:47.799 align:start position:0%
the Daily court system so I I think uh
 
00:57:47.799 --> 00:57:49.510 align:start position:0%
the Daily court system so I I think uh
that's

00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:54.839 align:start position:0%
um That's essential you know uh I I know
 
00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
Chief allenberg and others are very
 
00:57:59.309 --> 00:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
aware you know it's discussions we
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes have on the Port Smith police
 
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:05.720 align:start position:0%
commission that um the communication
 
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
problem between the police and the
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and the courts so that
 
00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
prosecutors know what's um uh what the
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
background of the individual that's in
 
00:58:22.829 --> 00:58:22.839 align:start position:0%
front of them when they are first
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
dealing with when they're dealing with
 
00:58:26.029 --> 00:58:26.039 align:start position:0%
that person person at a bail hearing
 
00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:27.640 align:start position:0%
with which is their first
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
encounter you know uh the description
 
00:58:33.549 --> 00:58:33.559 align:start position:0%
that Chief aldenberg gave conversation
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
with uh an assistant County attorney is
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
just uh outrageous that they weren't
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
even aware that they could file a motion
 
00:58:45.549 --> 00:58:45.559 align:start position:0%
as I understood what he said they
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
weren't even aware they could file a
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
motion to revoke
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
bail yeah it it um I
 
00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
mean members of this committee have
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
heard me talk about uh you know the the
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
statute's fine the bail statute's fine
 
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
it's just got to be people got to use it
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
I mean there's mechanisms for people who
 
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
are rearrested after being out on bail
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
on a misdemeanor or a felony there are
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
plenty of me mechanisms in the bail
 
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
statute as it is for them to be called
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
to account for being rearrested is just
 
00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:25.559 align:start position:0%
prosecuted it's not that police's fault
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
except in those jurisdictions where
 
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
there's a police prosecutor it's the
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
prosecutor's fault they're just not
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
doing it uh maybe it's a staffing issue
 
00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
what Chief Al the story Chief aldenberg
 
00:59:38.349 --> 00:59:38.359 align:start position:0%
told me you know said testified to you
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
just like that's an education problem um
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully it wasn't one of my former
 
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
students who said
 
00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.789 align:start position:0%
students who said
that

00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
well and I this would be a good time for
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
me to um say this and um I I want to
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
make sure that the the members of the
 
00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
committee and the public we we are not
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
um we're not blaming any particular
 
01:00:01.029 --> 01:00:01.039 align:start position:0%
especially you know we're talking a lot
 
01:00:03.549 --> 01:00:03.559 align:start position:0%
about the courts and it always strikes
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
me when I watch a state of the union
 
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
where the courts have to sit on their
 
01:00:10.270 --> 01:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
hands whilst somebody berate them
 
01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
because they are um they're not supposed
 
01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:13.839 align:start position:0%
to have opinions and they're not
 
01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:16.039 align:start position:0%
supposed to be defending themselves so I
 
01:00:17.309 --> 01:00:17.319 align:start position:0%
want to make it clear we're not bashing
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
the court we're not bashing the
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
prosecutors we're not bashing anybody um
 
01:00:23.789 --> 01:00:23.799 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to fix a problem and
 
01:00:26.349 --> 01:00:26.359 align:start position:0%
um if if a district attorney wasn't
 
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
aware of that then um I I I don't I
 
01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
don't think that it's I'm not going to
 
01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
Advocate that we make them go to school
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
again I just hope that they maybe get
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
wind of it and they realize they can but
 
01:00:41.029 --> 01:00:41.039 align:start position:0%
right now I'm concerned with this
 
01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
information system and it seems like
 
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
everything we're discussing is
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
predicated upon someone having the
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
proper information so a DA who doesn't
 
01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
know someone's full record or may not
 
01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
even want to appeal it because it seems
 
01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
like you know all he's dealing with is a
 
01:00:58.349 --> 01:00:58.359 align:start position:0%
case in front of him and a a bail
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner not being able to see that
 
01:01:03.309 --> 01:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
someone has a history of defaults can't
 
01:01:05.789 --> 01:01:05.799 align:start position:0%
make an informed decision um so it seems
 
01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:07.160 align:start position:0%
like it all is heading back to that
 
01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:09.839 align:start position:0%
information problem I I I I agree with
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Roy and you know
 
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh more broadly but in vain with what
 
01:01:21.069 --> 01:01:21.079 align:start position:0%
you're saying I mean I uh I've had
 
01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
concerns about the BL statute being
 
01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
blamed for all the problems in the
 
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
system and and I think uh there's a lot
 
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
in there that if used properly it would
 
01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
be fine that said I think I think the
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
the chair's goal and this committee's
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's goal to uh look more
 
01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:43.799 align:start position:0%
comprehensively at systemic problems is
 
01:01:46.589 --> 01:01:46.599 align:start position:0%
going to involve you know the court
 
01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
system putting a little skin in the game
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
and making some changes prosecutors
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing the public defender
 
01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
office in terms of Staff Staffing

we want to make this the bail statute
 
01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:09.200 align:start position:0%

request the money it's going to take to
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
fix this that the whole system agrees
 
01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
that it needs to be fixed and it's not
 
01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
just this committee trying to fix it the
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
agrees wheeler thank you Professor shear
 
01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
and I agree with you chairman Roy that
 
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
it is we're not blaming anybody this is
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
a multifaceted problem and it's a
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
systemic one that needs to be addressed
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
um would you say to that point that HB
 
01:03:01.630 --> 01:03:01.640 align:start position:0%
46 FN fiscal note um the bill put
 
01:03:04.029 --> 01:03:04.039 align:start position:0%
forward by ranking member Harriet goth
 
01:03:05.269 --> 01:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
which would have replaced bail
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
Commissioners with magistrates would
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
that go anywhere in helping people get
 
01:03:12.029 --> 01:03:12.039 align:start position:0%
in front of a judge and not uh be held
 
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
without trial it would um um you know
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
I've thought long and hard about that
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the expense of that uh
 
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the time it'll take to
 
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
implement that um I you know I'm
 
01:03:30.029 --> 01:03:30.039 align:start position:0%
supportive of that idea I think there
 
01:03:32.349 --> 01:03:32.359 align:start position:0%
may be other options that might be
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
cheaper and quicker to implement that
 
01:03:38.109 --> 01:03:38.119 align:start position:0%
would have the same effect um but that's
 
01:03:40.029 --> 01:03:40.039 align:start position:0%
as much you know talking with the court
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
system about what's possible what isn't
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
possible um you know I I have no
 
01:03:50.069 --> 01:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
philosophical or ideological problem
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
with a Magistrate Judge system I I'm
 
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
more than willing to
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
consider um there might be other
 
01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
possibilities um that would get us at
 
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
least for bail purposes uh something
 
01:04:08.109 --> 01:04:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%

Department the bill is
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
proposed is a step in the right
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
direction in regards to giving all
 
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
parties time and that's the issue here
 
01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
it's the time
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
to look at the criminal history it's the
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
time to reach out once again we don't
 
01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:05:34.589 --> 01:05:34.599 align:start position:0%
system where I can print up and the
 
01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:37.480 align:start position:0%
Commonwealth does Massachusetts
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
probation parole they prepare a report
 
01:05:42.549 --> 01:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
for the court and that lists everything
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
from juvenile offenses up if they're on
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
probation what is the status of the
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
probation what the offenses are here I
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
can have my dispatch run a record
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
check then I have to review
 
01:05:59.549 --> 01:05:59.559 align:start position:0%
it and look at the look at the history
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
look at the sentencing and then I have
 
01:06:04.349 --> 01:06:04.359 align:start position:0%
to look up to see okay I think he's
 
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
still on probation now I make a phone
 
01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
call to
 
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:09.559 align:start position:0%
probation is this guy still on probation
 
01:06:11.309 --> 01:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
who's a probation
 
01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
officer so these are all things that
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
01:06:17.269 --> 01:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
done when you're calling in a bail
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%

01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
not going to have or she's not going to
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
have any of this
 
01:06:25.269 --> 01:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
information what we're asking for in
 
01:06:26.589 --> 01:06:26.599 align:start position:0%
this bill and and what the bill is
 
01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:29.240 align:start position:0%

01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
crimes the person will be held they're
 
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
going to come in they're going to get a
 
01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
fair Hearing in front of a judge in
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
other words they're going to have a
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
defense attorney that defense attorney
 
01:06:40.269 --> 01:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
is going to have time to talk to that
 
01:06:43.829 --> 01:06:43.839 align:start position:0%
person get their personal history and be
 
01:06:45.789 --> 01:06:45.799 align:start position:0%
able to argue that intelligently to the
 
01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
judge the prosecutor is also going to
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
have the time to do what I just said to
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
review the record to look at the record
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
and then investigate make some phone
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
calls and once again I can present my
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
case to the judge the defense can
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
present theirs and the judge can make an
 
01:07:04.799 --> 01:07:06.710 align:start position:0%
present theirs and the judge can make an
informed

01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
informed
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
for thank you um if we did have a a Bop
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
system like that um would it not make it
 
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
a lot simpler easier and safer um I mean
 
01:07:24.029 --> 01:07:24.039 align:start position:0%
you referenced the Board of Probation
 
01:07:26.589 --> 01:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts the record check I believe
 
01:07:28.829 --> 01:07:28.839 align:start position:0%
it covers all of mass Juvenile and you
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
can do a triple I as well um if you had
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
all that information available to the
 
01:07:35.789 --> 01:07:35.799 align:start position:0%
officer on the street um the bail
 
01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner you as the police
 
01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
prosecutor You Could See Clearly default
 
01:07:42.029 --> 01:07:42.039 align:start position:0%
default default I mean it shows
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
everything all the history and you would
 
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
know if they're on probation if they're
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
on parole um I believe the mass system
 
01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
if a police officer runs a record check
 
01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
on a parole the that system notifies the
 
01:07:58.510 --> 01:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
parole officer that one of his parole Le
 
01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
has been has been bopped his record
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
checks been pulled which triggers him to
 
01:08:04.269 --> 01:08:04.279 align:start position:0%
call his Poley and say what are you
 
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
doing or call the police department say
 
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
why were you running my guy so I I
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
continue to go back to I think that
 
01:08:11.119 --> 01:08:12.109 align:start position:0%
continue to go back to I think that
rather

01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
rather
 
01:08:15.309 --> 01:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
than this right away we need to get that
 
01:08:18.749 --> 01:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
information system fixed as part of
 
01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
this what you're looking for is a is a
 
01:08:24.669 --> 01:08:24.679 align:start position:0%
huge um it is
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's a huge take and it and it's
 
01:08:29.789 --> 01:08:29.799 align:start position:0%
momentous for a state especially a rural
 
01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
State like we are um I worked in those
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
small police departments yeah um I can
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
tell you that 2 in the morning when I've
 
01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:38.440 align:start position:0%

01:09:14.669 --> 01:09:14.679 align:start position:0%
dating myself we didn't have email um it
 
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't emailed um so there was no way
 
01:09:21.309 --> 01:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
for me other than them on the phone
 
01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
telling me what it is and I'm writing
 
01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
down as much as I possibly
 
01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
can even with a connected system I still
 
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
think I'm not going to be able to get
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about small towns
 
01:09:34.829 --> 01:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
that just don't have that capability or
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
ability where we do is giving the time
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
that 24 hours or that 48 depending on
 
01:09:44.669 --> 01:09:44.679 align:start position:0%
over a weekend or whatever is giving the
 
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
person time to be able to get all that
 
01:09:49.149 --> 01:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
information to be able to come in and as
 
01:09:50.669 --> 01:09:50.679 align:start position:0%
I say this is not
 
01:09:52.829 --> 01:09:52.839 align:start position:0%
one-sided this now allows the defense
 
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
attorney time to sit down whether it's
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
going to be 20 minutes a half hour an
 
01:09:59.470 --> 01:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
hour to get that information before we
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
have that hearing if we come in in Derry
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
um where our time is we at nine o'clock
 
01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
and then it goes from different courts
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the day U for the
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
arraignments so depending on the time
 
01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
people you know the defense attorney and
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
the prosecutors will have time to
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
present that once again so the court has
 
01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
all the information to make an informed
 
01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:24.870 align:start position:0%
all the information to make an informed
decision

01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:10:26.910 --> 01:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
and that's what that bill this bill will
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
allow the um the dairy police department
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
has a leaps terminal I assume correct
 
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the dairy police department
 
01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
has a leaps terminal I I assume the to
 
01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
to run the records to do we run yes
 
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
we're able to run it at our station and
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
print them out at our station do you
 
01:10:44.669 --> 01:10:44.679 align:start position:0%
have any idea about how many departments
 
01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
in the state are not interconnected or
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
have not the ability to run a record
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
check that I could
 
01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.510 align:start position:0%
check that I could
ballpark

01:10:54.510 --> 01:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
ballpark
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
I want to say less than
 
01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.310 align:start position:0%
I want to say less than
50%

01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
50%
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
probably well a lot less I I would
 
01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:03.640 align:start position:0%
probably say you're down to a quarter
 
01:11:05.950 --> 01:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
25% is Chief
 
01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.790 align:start position:0%
25% is Chief
here

01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:11:11.070 --> 01:11:11.080 align:start position:0%
um okay but the majority of police
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
departments they're not their own
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
dispatch dispatches are run by the
 
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
counties or a bigger community so they
 
01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
don't th those communities who have the
 
01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
dispatch those will have centers they
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
will be able to run those records mhm
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
but that police officer cannot go back
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
to the majority of the small towns the
 
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
part-time police departments they do not
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
have the capability of Running Records
 
01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
out of their office or have a mobile
 
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
data terminal in their
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle as I say they it depends on on
 
01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.669 align:start position:0%
vehicle as I say they it depends on on
their

01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
connectivity um and I mean when I was a
 
01:11:45.310 --> 01:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
police officer granted I'm we're
 
01:11:48.669 --> 01:11:48.679 align:start position:0%
talking 20 30 years ago now actually 30
 
01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
years ago now um I had a portable that
 
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
was this big and we used it to throw at
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
people because that's all it was good
 
01:11:58.590 --> 01:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
for I mean you didn't have any
 
01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
connection okay all right thank you any
 
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
questions for go ahead Stone one of the
 
01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
questions and I can't recall is breach
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
of bail a standalone charge in New
 
01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no it is not it's criminal
 
01:12:15.550 --> 01:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
contempt that's what we charge criminal
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
contempt is in your experience to many
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
officers utilize
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
that there are well quite frankly there
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
are departments who charge breach of
 
01:12:27.149 --> 01:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
bail there is we don't believe that is
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
under the statute but it is charged uh
 
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
criminal contempt we do charge and we do
 
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
it on a regular basis yes uh I don't
 
01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:34.709 align:start position:0%
it on a regular basis yes uh I don't
know

01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
how I I would say it's underutilized
 
01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's really not charged U but it is
 
01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:42.280 align:start position:0%
a criminal contempt of the court and the
 
01:12:43.709 --> 01:12:43.719 align:start position:0%
problem with that is the criminal
 
01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
contempt is for the actual court so if
 
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
somebody's out on bail say from
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester and we stop him in Dairy for
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
a violation then we know the ify
 
01:12:55.229 --> 01:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
Manchester because they would have to
 
01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
file the criminal contempt because it's
 
01:13:01.709 --> 01:13:01.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony thank
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
you uh representative scitec would you
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
committee um for the purposes of the
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee representative citex is not a
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
member of the subcommittee he is here
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
just to provide information and to help
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
us because of his experience as a bail
 
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner in as many years in the
 
01:13:28.990 --> 01:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
house thank you for listening um I'm
 
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
us anyone in the back row that can't
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
hear please feel free to move to the
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
front row and we'll try and talk a
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
little bit louder and we just uh the
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative kindly just turned up the
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
speaker I
 
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
believe Okay I uh I think what I want to
 
01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
do here is to present
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
a the uh ba a bail commissioner's point
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
of view I think I can speak for many of
 
01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
them I know four personally I know a
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
dozen through our meetings our uh yearly
 
01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
meetings and I don't think I'm talking
 
01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
uh want to be careful not to overstate
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
anything uh I want to uh uh Chief
 
01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:23.719 align:start position:0%
ferber's gone I did about 10 baales in
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
Manchester and they really treated me
 
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
right so it's nice to know I wish he had
 
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
heard that
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh I'm also mildly annoyed Professor
 
01:14:35.629 --> 01:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
Sher because he said a lot of the things
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to say in
 
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
particular what he talked about and what
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
I'm going to f argue with uh prosecutor
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
Jordan about is the front end what the
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
bail system does what it's intended to
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
do it is the front end it's not a judge
 
01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
judging of Innocence or guilt and what
 
01:14:59.470 --> 01:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
if you follow the dynamic of today's
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Muse opened
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
the door and representative gaite piled
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
right in on conflating the pro the
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
overwhelming problem of substance misuse
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
chief chief says we let them out where
 
01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
do they go what do we do and Professor
 
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
sir Sher corrected that to
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
that's not quite what the that's not at
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
all what the bail process is about and I
 
01:15:33.149 --> 01:15:33.159 align:start position:0%
want to focus on the bill from as I said
 
01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
from a bail commissioner's point of view
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
even though those problems are so
 
01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
overwhelming as to almost blunt what
 
01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
anything we do here because we're
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
talking about lives too over drugs oh my
 
01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
god um one of the problems I have is
 
01:15:55.229 --> 01:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
with what uh uh the chief said and the
 
01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
prosecutor has said is if someone I
 
01:15:59.550 --> 01:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
don't know what they're calling it I
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
don't but if you're out on bail and you
 
01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
commit a
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
crime you do not the police don't have
 
01:16:10.629 --> 01:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
to call any bail commissionary they just
 
01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
they can send them to in our case
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
Brentwood in Rockingham County they
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
don't I don't want to be called if there
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
are certain other crimes that already
 
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
exist that we can't bail we can't bail
 
01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
murder we can't bail fugitive from
 
01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
Justice and we can't bail violations of
 
01:16:32.310 --> 01:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
of a restraining order and I'm that's
 
01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:34.470 align:start position:0%
of a restraining order and I'm that's
perfectly

01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
perfectly
 
01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:36.149 align:start position:0%
perfectly
fine

01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
fine
 
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
now why
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
I'm I have a problem with what the
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
um uh prosecutor Jordan has talked about
 
01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.310 align:start position:0%
um uh prosecutor Jordan has talked about
is

01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
this sure the records aren't great we
 
01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
don't know who's on bail from Manchester
 
01:16:55.149 --> 01:16:55.159 align:start position:0%
when Derry Picks Them Up I understand
 
01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
that but whenever I'm bailed do a bail I
 
01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
get the person's history now I look at
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
that history and I say it's
 
01:17:05.550 --> 01:17:05.560 align:start position:0%
largely not
 
01:17:09.629 --> 01:17:09.639 align:start position:0%
relevant I am there to judge Flight Risk
 
01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
please don't lose sight of that and
 
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
danger to society I don't care what he
 
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
did in
 
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
2017 I don't care if he has
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
defaults unless they're excessive when I
 
01:17:25.229 --> 01:17:25.239 align:start position:0%
talk to PE I you they have the right to
 
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
a face to face I talk to I didn't get a
 
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
letter well maybe he didn't maybe he's
 
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
not telling me the truth I
 
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
moved he has a side to his story on a
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
default I'm not going
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
to so I I want to tell you from our
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
point of view from
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
a uh bail commissioner's point of view
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
we're we're very we're very careful what
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
I'm I want to talk about one crime in
 
01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
the bill and that is the domestic
 
01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
violence we see lots of them and no
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
every judge everybody what they're not
 
01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
they're not going to incarcerate they're
 
01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
going to say are you going to obey the
 
01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
criminal bail protective order and if
 
01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
they feel that they're they're going to
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
go live with their brother and they're
 
01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
not going to be go with their wife and
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
they'll sit for s for a civil standby to
 
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
get their underwear so they to work the
 
01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:24.990 align:start position:0%
get their underwear so they to work the
next

01:18:24.990 --> 01:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
day everybody does that I've had an I
 
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
have my copy books if anybody wants to
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
see them later the 3,500 Bales I've done
 
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
I've done maybe under 10 in my history
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
fonus domestic violence fonus is he put
 
01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
his hands on her throat uh he shouldn't
 
01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
do anything but it isn't that he had her
 
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
on the floor choked her to death I
 
01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
mean it's all done on allegation
 
01:18:57.629 --> 01:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
now the two in the morning business look
 
01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
at 2 in the morning I am deciding Flight
 
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
Risk not their history not a lot of are
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
they going to show up for court are they
 
01:19:09.310 --> 01:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
going to misbehave if I let them out
 
01:19:12.270 --> 01:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm judging not all these
 
01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
other things that are useful interesting
 
01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
that occur farther in the
 
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
process I'm going
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
to so I wanted to talk about that one
 
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
aspect I'm going to finish with a bold
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
statement I don't really want to say
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
anything further because Professor
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
sher's idea of felonies and maybe not
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
all felonies I'm talk that maybe violent
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
felonies or where you suspect that
 
01:19:41.629 --> 01:19:41.639 align:start position:0%
there's going to not obey a restraining
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
order or they're going to continue
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
Behavior but now we're fine-tuning I
 
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
have the his list as he's proposed is
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
okay but I don't think the Bill's
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
necessary at all because because bail
 
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
commission I heard the chief I don't
 
01:19:59.870 --> 01:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
believe that we're letting people out on
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
fonus sexual assault on of course I
 
01:20:04.990 --> 01:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
haven't done one as a matter in all that
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
time because look when we aren't sure
 
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
and as I said I'm speaking to be I'm
 
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
going to say to myself and out loud I'm
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
not com comfortable here letting this
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
person go I want the judge to decide
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
this now I may have my own opinion and I
 
01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
may be right but the judge is
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
final not because he's right but because
 
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
he's final I'll conclude if I may with
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
or I think I'm going to conclude I don't
 
01:20:38.110 --> 01:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
know I scribbled here look the first
 
01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
couple years I did this I'm very care I
 
01:20:43.709 --> 01:20:43.719 align:start position:0%
try to be look I I I sometimes talk a
 
01:20:46.669 --> 01:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
little flip but I try to be careful
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
about we're dealing with people's loss
 
01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
of Liberty come on you you just can't be
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
Cavalier about that but so for the first
 
01:20:57.790 --> 01:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
couple years I was doing
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
this and by the way there were very few
 
01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:01.719 align:start position:0%
almost everything is personal
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
recognizance there there are very few
 
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
cash bails very few hes I spent out
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
three hours I spent in exitor hospital
 
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
because the guy threatened two police
 
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
departments I'm going to find out who
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
arrested me I'm going to kill him or
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
take him out that the guy's drunk he
 
01:21:23.229 --> 01:21:23.239 align:start position:0%
would probably be all right but said I
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to take any chances so for
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
three hours I sat there while they tried
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
to sober and said finally we did a
 
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
preventive detention and I went home
 
01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
because I just didn't want to take any
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
chances with this situation and I don't
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
think any bail commissioner is going to
 
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
take any chances whether this bill
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
exists or whether it doesn't exist but
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
as again I said I have no problem with
 
01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
Professor sher's thing so I as I said
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
for two years I tracked no judge ever
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
changed my bail
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
one one did I put a cash bail on
 
01:22:01.870 --> 01:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
somebody I wasn't comfortable with but I
 
01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to give them some opportunity
 
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
that if they knew this money was at risk
 
01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
they might behave and the
 
01:22:13.390 --> 01:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
judge just held them but that that's one
 
01:22:16.629 --> 01:22:16.639 align:start position:0%
out of I don't know 10 15 that I
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
actually Chas once you once you finished
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
your paperwork you God you go home you
 
01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
don't but I followed them the Superior
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
Court to see I asked our clerk locally
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
what happened to Joe Blow and no judge
 
01:22:34.030 --> 01:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
has and I think I I'm trying to speak
 
01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
for other I I don't believe I'm out of
 
01:22:39.070 --> 01:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
turn I don't want to be speaking for
 
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
other bail Commissioners they can speak
 
01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
for themselves but I don't think we're
 
01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
too big for our britches whether this
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
bill exists or whether it doesn't exist
 
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm not in favor of the bill I think
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
if if you had a compromise with
 
01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
Professor sher's felonies I wish he
 
01:22:57.629 --> 01:22:57.639 align:start position:0%
hadn't said so many interesting and
 
01:22:57.639 --> 01:22:58.709 align:start position:0%
hadn't said so many interesting and
useful

01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
useful
 
01:22:58.719 --> 01:23:00.430 align:start position:0%
useful
things

01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
um all
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
right representative if if you could I'm
 
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
done what is your not the notice that
 
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
you've um since be reform in 2018 how
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
has that affected if at all how you
 
01:23:15.270 --> 01:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
conduct your job you know the truth is I
 
01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
tried to do my job irrespective of that
 
01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
I did not want to be incarcerating
 
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
people for lack of as indigent I just
 
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
didn't do that I somebody didn't I we
 
01:23:29.310 --> 01:23:29.320 align:start position:0%
were told look District bail
 
01:23:31.709 --> 01:23:31.719 align:start position:0%
Commissioners follow the orders of their
 
01:23:35.709 --> 01:23:35.719 align:start position:0%
District Court Judge we see them once a
 
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
year for a conference and we'll get
 
01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes get periodic updates okay for
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
example judge Corby and Salem said don't
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
ever bail a be state police come with
 
01:23:50.629 --> 01:23:50.639 align:start position:0%
bees I don't want to bail you but they
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
that's their tradition so I no Drive
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
just to put a bail condition but there's
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
some inconsistencies in the court system
 
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
too I'm not bashing anybody but one hand
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't always know what the other hand
 
01:24:07.229 --> 01:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
is doing look I don't live in the Ivory
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
Tower I live in the booking room okay
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
and I see this stuff and I try I think
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
other bail Commissioners try to respect
 
01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
you're talking about person's personal
 
01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
Liberty who wants to spend a night in
 
01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
jail oh it's only 24 hours who who wants
 
01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
to spend 24 hours in Brentwood jail I I
 
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
don't know no thank you for
 
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
listening thank you represent you have a
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
question representative wheeler and then
 
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
representative Muse first of all
 
01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
representative scitec thank you very
 
01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony I think that was
 
01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
incredibly helpful um my question has to
 
01:24:44.109 --> 01:24:44.119 align:start position:0%
do with the topic that we were talking
 
01:24:46.030 --> 01:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
about earlier today and I want to hear
 
01:24:48.189 --> 01:24:48.199 align:start position:0%
your opinion maybe you can't give it do
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
you think that bail Commissioners should
 
01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
be paid for the work that they do
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
more so than they already are in some
 
01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
case as I told you yes yesterday I'm
 
01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
very lucky it's two out of 10 one out of
 
01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
10 I miss not so when I did Manchester I
 
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
did about 10 there paid for half and I'm
 
01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
driving from Salem to as a for the team
 
01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
I I didn't want to let Manchester down
 
01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
um yes they should be paid I mean if
 
01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:20.870 align:start position:0%
um yes they should be paid I mean if
we're

01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
contemplating what I I think it Prof I
 
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
would disagree with Professor Sher about
 
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
the magistrate system I think right now
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
we're paying nothing
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
mag 10 15 magistrates covering the State
 
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
247 really on the on another you're
 
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
going to wake up a magistrate an
 
01:25:41.229 --> 01:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
important person at two in the morning
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
youve waking up a schnook like me at two
 
01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
in the morning I'll come in Magistrate's
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
going to Justice may be short Change
 
01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
there leave them in jail let
 
01:25:53.310 --> 01:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
them yes they should be paid I don't
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
know the mechanism uh but it's just not
 
01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
maybe not the full I I just don't know
 
01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's an important topic perhaps
 
01:26:06.270 --> 01:26:06.280 align:start position:0%
for another day not this not this I'm
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
trying to keep it to this bill as much
 
01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
as I can but I didn't want to not answer
 
01:26:16.669 --> 01:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
then every time a a baill commissioner
 
01:26:23.070 --> 01:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
testifies uh we we we do get an educ
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
um but one of the things that always
 
01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
strikes me uh in just hearing different
 
01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
people tell your story their stories and
 
01:26:31.629 --> 01:26:31.639 align:start position:0%
this is the first time I've I've heard
 
01:26:36.109 --> 01:26:36.119 align:start position:0%
you tell yours um is it it just always
 
01:26:39.390 --> 01:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
strikes me how much subjectivity is part
 
01:26:44.590 --> 01:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
of the process so so for example um you
 
01:26:47.310 --> 01:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
had said that having having those
 
01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:49.480 align:start position:0%
electronic records uh that we've been
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
talking about may not necessarily be
 
01:26:52.830 --> 01:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
helpful to you
 
01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
in in making your decision um and and it
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
sounds like a lot of what you decide is
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
sort of based on your impression of the
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
person how they conduct themselves what
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
they're charged with what the police
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
what the police say so um what I'm
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
curious about is uh
 
01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
is are you is the way that you approach
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
it is that the model for all B bail
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
Commissioners or is that the way you
 
01:27:24.030 --> 01:27:24.040 align:start position:0%
approach it and and what level of
 
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
consistency is there uh from bail
 
01:27:29.470 --> 01:27:29.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner to bail commissioner in New
 
01:27:32.189 --> 01:27:32.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I can definitely tell you I
 
01:27:32.199 --> 01:27:33.310 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I can definitely tell you I
don't

01:27:33.310 --> 01:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
know uh I believe from I have tried to
 
01:27:42.189 --> 01:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
be more articulate than others but I
 
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
believe that's a kind of cultural aspect
 
01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
of bail Commissioners I think we have
 
01:27:51.870 --> 01:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
another one here may two you might ask
 
01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:53.510 align:start position:0%
another one here may two you might ask
them

01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
to comment on my testimony to see how
 
01:27:59.830 --> 01:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's at variance with their
 
01:28:02.669 --> 01:28:02.679 align:start position:0%
experience with their world view you
 
01:28:07.470 --> 01:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
said also if I may about
 
01:28:10.189 --> 01:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
subjectivity yes even judges are going
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
to be have some element of
 
01:28:17.070 --> 01:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
subjectivity I I do people talk to me I
 
01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:20.719 align:start position:0%
want to hear what they're to they have
 
01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
the right to be heard
 
01:28:26.350 --> 01:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
in my view and many times it's just cut
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
and dried but there are other times that
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
I really didn't get the letter I really
 
01:28:34.109 --> 01:28:34.119 align:start position:0%
please understand that that and look
 
01:28:37.149 --> 01:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
there was another perhaps irrelevant
 
01:28:40.109 --> 01:28:40.119 align:start position:0%
story I was called This is everything's
 
01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
two in the morning it seems but this
 
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
really was maybe not that gu the police
 
01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
this guy has been long record of drugs
 
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
drug misuse he was was picked up for
 
01:28:57.550 --> 01:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
selling we want High cash
 
01:29:00.310 --> 01:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
bail oh this sounds like a tough bad
 
01:29:04.109 --> 01:29:04.119 align:start position:0%
customer I come into the police station
 
01:29:05.950 --> 01:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
look I normally agree with the police
 
01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
but I come in I I want to talk to this
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
guy and when to ask for a bail
 
01:29:13.109 --> 01:29:13.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner what comes out of this cell
 
01:29:15.070 --> 01:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
but a Sad
 
01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:16.590 align:start position:0%
but a Sad
Sack

01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
Sack
 
01:29:21.229 --> 01:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
near derel is too strong but just this
 
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
is not drug he must I don't know what
 
01:29:26.109 --> 01:29:26.119 align:start position:0%
the deal was he probably had some wanted
 
01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:28.280 align:start position:0%
to buy a fix or something from somebody
 
01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
else or and maybe offered to sell
 
01:29:34.189 --> 01:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
something so I'm looking this guy did
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
not warrant you talked about
 
01:29:39.390 --> 01:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
subjectivity that was my subjectivity
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
this guy was not worth a felony
 
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
Char I can't change the charge that the
 
01:29:47.310 --> 01:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
police make that's their
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
business but I can set conditions of
 
01:29:54.030 --> 01:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
bail and I check no no drug use for your
 
01:29:57.109 --> 01:29:57.119 align:start position:0%
own good please don't do this and let
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
him go on personal recognizance this is
 
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
not this was
 
01:30:03.709 --> 01:30:03.719 align:start position:0%
not it was subjective but I believe I
 
01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
did the right thing furthermore as I
 
01:30:09.149 --> 01:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
want to repeat you see this judge 20 12
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%

ourselves um their relevance and how we

02:21:01.389 --> 02:21:01.399 align:start position:0%
um yes a lot of people were very hungry
 
02:21:03.349 --> 02:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
um at this point I would invite we have
 
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
an Alderman here from Manchester I would
 
02:21:07.550 --> 02:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
invite her to uh come up and address the
 
02:21:15.670 --> 02:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:18.870 --> 02:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
to thank you chair o sorry a little loud
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
in uh committee members uh I'm Christy
 
02:21:24.750 --> 02:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
canor a concerned Citizen and um an
 
02:21:28.110 --> 02:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
alderman in Manchester and I'm a victim
 
02:21:30.550 --> 02:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
of stalking and I definitely don't want
 
02:21:34.349 --> 02:21:34.359 align:start position:0%
it taken off the list um and I'm highly
 
02:21:37.550 --> 02:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about um really helping people
 
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
and slowing the process um to get people
 
02:21:44.230 --> 02:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
to get help that they need and I know as
 
02:21:48.710 --> 02:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
a victim of um stalking and so forth
 
02:21:52.469 --> 02:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
from a previous time that it escalates
 
02:21:55.389 --> 02:21:55.399 align:start position:0%
and it's um it's a known fact that
 
02:21:58.550 --> 02:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
you're not born a pedophile um there's a
 
02:22:01.510 --> 02:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
process that it it's a it elevates and
 
02:22:03.990 --> 02:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
that is my biggest concern is um you
 
02:22:05.630 --> 02:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
know stopping that process and getting
 
02:22:07.990 --> 02:22:08.000 align:start position:0%

02:22:11.429 --> 02:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
need thank you um could you tell us in
 
02:22:12.830 --> 02:22:12.840 align:start position:0%

hat on for a second what are you are
 
02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:18.640 align:start position:0%

bail so what we're what we're seeing is
 
02:22:32.190 --> 02:22:32.200 align:start position:0%
um people are let out right away and
 
02:22:34.389 --> 02:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
committing more crimes and it's
 
02:22:37.630 --> 02:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
affecting everyone's livelihood and
 
02:22:40.030 --> 02:22:40.040 align:start position:0%

been re uh arrested a second time um
 
02:22:50.950 --> 02:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
after they've been out on bail so it's
 
02:22:55.389 --> 02:22:55.399 align:start position:0%
really affecting um feeling feeling safe
 
02:22:55.399 --> 02:22:58.790 align:start position:0%
really affecting um feeling feeling safe
in

02:22:58.790 --> 02:22:58.800 align:start position:0%

02:23:23.230 --> 02:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday and you didn't really want but
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:53.790 align:start position:0%
 
ahead

02:23:53.790 --> 02:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:55.030 --> 02:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee
 
02:23:56.230 --> 02:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
02:23:58.389 --> 02:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
testify my name is Frank kak with the
 
02:24:01.710 --> 02:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
ACLU of New Hampshire um the handout I
 
02:24:03.469 --> 02:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
gave you I know you all probably looks
 
02:24:04.910 --> 02:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
familiar because i' given it to you all
 
02:24:06.550 --> 02:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
or at least part of it last session and
 
02:24:07.990 --> 02:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm giving it to you today
 
02:24:10.150 --> 02:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
and it's about the a bill that's not
 
02:24:13.150 --> 02:24:13.160 align:start position:0%
spec it's one of the bills before is uh
 
02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
because uh both uh Professor Sher and um
 
02:24:20.150 --> 02:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative scitec mentioned uh under
 
02:24:23.110 --> 02:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
existing law the Myriad ways that uh
 
02:24:26.469 --> 02:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
people can be held um if they are um in
 
02:24:28.190 --> 02:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
violation if they commit a new offense
 
02:24:30.510 --> 02:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
Etc and so I just wanted to point
 
02:24:32.309 --> 02:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
specifically we actually went through
 
02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
the bails code which is quite long and
 
02:24:36.990 --> 02:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
pulled uh into just kind of easily
 
02:24:39.870 --> 02:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
digestible section so the it's like the
 
02:24:43.389 --> 02:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
third page in uh we go through and list
 
02:24:45.550 --> 02:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
just the verbatim code section so I
 
02:24:47.190 --> 02:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
literally just copy pasted so it's word
 
02:24:49.830 --> 02:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
for word um these are all the ways in
 
02:24:52.950 --> 02:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
current law that people can be held if
 
02:24:55.030 --> 02:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
they violate uh if they commit a new
 
02:24:58.070 --> 02:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
offense also includes I believe I forget
 
02:25:00.269 --> 02:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
who reference but around restraining
 
02:25:02.269 --> 02:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
orders and how there's no court judicial
 
02:25:04.750 --> 02:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
involvement how people can just be um
 
02:25:07.630 --> 02:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
rearrested and and detained um so all
 
02:25:10.910 --> 02:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
those are in there and I think as as uh
 
02:25:12.389 --> 02:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
profess sh mentioned it was quite
 
02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
telling that um the it sounds like
 
02:25:16.349 --> 02:25:16.359 align:start position:0%
what's happening in Manchester the fact
 
02:25:17.950 --> 02:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
that it sounds like it's just a public
 
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
education problem that prosecutors don't
 
02:25:22.309 --> 02:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
know that all these tools exist in
 
02:25:25.190 --> 02:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
current law um and so I think you know a
 
02:25:27.030 --> 02:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
really great first step would be to do
 
02:25:29.710 --> 02:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
education to you know let folks know who
 
02:25:31.990 --> 02:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
are in the judicial system about what
 
02:25:34.230 --> 02:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
the current law is what it what it isn't
 
02:25:36.630 --> 02:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
what they can use um to ensure that we
 
02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
are not defaulting to just incarcerating
 
02:25:40.990 --> 02:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
people because people don't know what
 
02:25:45.510 --> 02:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
they tools they already have um also uh
 
02:25:47.750 --> 02:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
just really appreciate um the
 
02:25:50.269 --> 02:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
conversation we've had today about um
 
02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that existing law or um um um
 
02:25:58.670 --> 02:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
um apologize lost my place where is it
 
02:26:03.910 --> 02:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
oh um the fact that um um sorry I just
 
02:26:05.550 --> 02:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I'm getting all my
 
02:26:09.030 --> 02:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:11.790 --> 02:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
apologize the uh so we had talked about
 
02:26:14.550 --> 02:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
um um um specific criminal laws and
 
02:26:16.030 --> 02:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
whether we want to have you know blanket
 
02:26:17.349 --> 02:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
holds on folks
 
02:26:19.190 --> 02:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
um uh in whether we want to have a
 
02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
blanket hold system which sb2 52 and
 
02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
some of the other bills before this or
 
02:26:25.389 --> 02:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
we want to have a more individualized
 
02:26:27.670 --> 02:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
approach and I think you know building
 
02:26:29.790 --> 02:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
on what uh chairman Roy had talked about
 
02:26:32.469 --> 02:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
last session and has alluded to today
 
02:26:34.150 --> 02:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
about trying to create use modern
 
02:26:36.309 --> 02:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
technology it is 2023 we have all this
 
02:26:38.750 --> 02:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
ability to take all this data and to get
 
02:26:42.309 --> 02:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
it to people who need it quickly um and
 
02:26:44.269 --> 02:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
to prioritize that so that judges or
 
02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
others making these important decisions
 
02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
have all that information before them
 
02:26:50.309 --> 02:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
right away we think is appropriate um
 
02:26:51.990 --> 02:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
and the reason that we are concerned
 
02:26:53.790 --> 02:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
about the some of the approaches that
 
02:26:55.630 --> 02:26:55.640 align:start position:0%
would just say for all these offense
 
02:26:58.469 --> 02:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
types we're automatically holding you uh
 
02:27:00.830 --> 02:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
is because you know the facts matter in
 
02:27:03.190 --> 02:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
these cases and so um and I don't mean
 
02:27:05.269 --> 02:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
to minimize the harm that some folks
 
02:27:07.469 --> 02:27:07.479 align:start position:0%
have felt and some of these do accompany
 
02:27:10.590 --> 02:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
very serious acts that that would result
 
02:27:12.990 --> 02:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
in these charges we just heard um from
 
02:27:15.790 --> 02:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker about stalking um
 
02:27:17.150 --> 02:27:17.160 align:start position:0%
and you know we agree that there are
 
02:27:20.110 --> 02:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
probably instances where people who are
 
02:27:22.230 --> 02:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
um charged with stalking may need to be
 
02:27:25.030 --> 02:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
held pre-trial um but just because
 
02:27:26.990 --> 02:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
someone is charged with stalking doesn't
 
02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
mean that it is a horrible fact in each
 
02:27:31.349 --> 02:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
case and so I actually spoke with a
 
02:27:34.550 --> 02:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
couple of criminal defense attorneys um
 
02:27:36.830 --> 02:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
who hear lots of these cases and so
 
02:27:38.349 --> 02:27:38.359 align:start position:0%
stalking was actually one of the ones
 
02:27:41.190 --> 02:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
that was flagged for me um they talked
 
02:27:42.950 --> 02:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
about how it you know conjures up these
 
02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
horrible images of someone hiding out in
 
02:27:46.750 --> 02:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
the bushes as like you know what when
 
02:27:48.349 --> 02:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
you think stalking this is what you
 
02:27:50.950 --> 02:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
often think about but in their practice
 
02:27:52.910 --> 02:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
what they usually saw was that it
 
02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
involved text messages and calls and
 
02:27:58.590 --> 02:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
often times the it was initiated by the
 
02:28:01.110 --> 02:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
victim um in those cases and so those
 
02:28:02.950 --> 02:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
people ended up being released by the
 
02:28:04.269 --> 02:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
baill commissioner because the baill
 
02:28:05.550 --> 02:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner could look at those
 
02:28:07.630 --> 02:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
specific facts in that specific case and
 
02:28:11.190 --> 02:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
say this doesn't Merit holding you um
 
02:28:12.429 --> 02:28:12.439 align:start position:0%
and that's what our current law the
 
02:28:14.269 --> 02:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
beauty of our current law it allows this
 
02:28:16.750 --> 02:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
individualized assessment um for the
 
02:28:19.190 --> 02:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
offense types so um we have other
 
02:28:22.950 --> 02:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
offenses uh that we heard about um for
 
02:28:26.269 --> 02:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
example um aggravated fenus sexual
 
02:28:28.750 --> 02:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
assault um what I heard from talking
 
02:28:31.110 --> 02:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
with the fence council is often times
 
02:28:33.670 --> 02:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
again horrific offenses um if they're
 
02:28:36.830 --> 02:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
true um but what we heard is that um
 
02:28:38.670 --> 02:28:38.680 align:start position:0%
often times in these cases the charges
 
02:28:41.469 --> 02:28:41.479 align:start position:0%
are filed years afterward where the
 
02:28:44.110 --> 02:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
alleged victim and the alleged offender
 
02:28:45.990 --> 02:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
no longer live together no longer have
 
02:28:48.670 --> 02:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
contact um and so again the facts in
 
02:28:50.950 --> 02:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
those cases should be brought before a
 
02:28:52.510 --> 02:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner or a judge they should
 
02:28:54.550 --> 02:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
be able to look at that and decide on
 
02:28:56.230 --> 02:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
that individual case whether or not
 
02:28:58.870 --> 02:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
someone should be held um and finally I
 
02:29:00.429 --> 02:29:00.439 align:start position:0%
know we talked about this a lot but it
 
02:29:02.269 --> 02:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
just came up um from the alderman in
 
02:29:05.150 --> 02:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester um is is just kind of what
 
02:29:07.110 --> 02:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
the facts are around Public Safety post
 
02:29:09.750 --> 02:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
bail reform and so again in that packet
 
02:29:13.150 --> 02:29:13.160 align:start position:0%
I handed yall um I we pulled this again
 
02:29:16.230 --> 02:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
this is directly from the state database
 
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
on on um crime so uh Department of
 
02:29:21.790 --> 02:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
safety's crime stats list from
 
02:29:24.389 --> 02:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
Manchester for group a crimes which are
 
02:29:26.150 --> 02:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of offense types all
 
02:29:28.870 --> 02:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
violent offenses in Manchester crime
 
02:29:32.590 --> 02:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
since between 2018 and 2020 the most uh
 
02:29:37.230 --> 02:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
2021 um crime is down for group a 13.9%
 
02:29:38.830 --> 02:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
arrests are down
 
02:29:43.110 --> 02:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
33% and for Group B arrests are down
 
02:29:45.790 --> 02:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
32% um so again the notion that we're
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
seeing in uptick in off crime is is not
 
02:29:51.269 --> 02:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
born out by the actual data that the
 
02:29:54.230 --> 02:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
police have provided to the state um so
 
02:29:55.590 --> 02:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions and really
 
02:29:57.630 --> 02:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate um the thoughtfulness that
 
02:30:00.030 --> 02:30:00.040 align:start position:0%
this committee is approaching this way
 
02:30:04.429 --> 02:30:04.439 align:start position:0%
thank you um if you if you could um the
 
02:30:08.030 --> 02:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
the arrests and and crimes being up or
 
02:30:10.950 --> 02:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
down it really it it doesn't really
 
02:30:12.830 --> 02:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily correlate to whether or not
 
02:30:15.150 --> 02:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
someone's rearrested on on a charge if
 
02:30:17.429 --> 02:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
they're already out on bail this numbers
 
02:30:19.750 --> 02:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
just speak to the overall crime which
 
02:30:21.830 --> 02:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily be impacted either
 
02:30:24.710 --> 02:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
way by bail it's based on a whole
 
02:30:28.070 --> 02:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
plethora of social um economic things is
 
02:30:29.830 --> 02:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
that is that correct I totally agree
 
02:30:31.190 --> 02:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
with that I think but our concern is
 
02:30:33.269 --> 02:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
that the the rhetoric that this is
 
02:30:35.110 --> 02:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
putting forth is that Manchester is this
 
02:30:36.670 --> 02:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
dangerous PL that these cities have
 
02:30:39.389 --> 02:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
become dangerous because of baale um and
 
02:30:40.990 --> 02:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
so I think you know building on that
 
02:30:43.150 --> 02:30:43.160 align:start position:0%
point you know we've we've heard these
 
02:30:45.469 --> 02:30:45.479 align:start position:0%
stories um we've seen no specific
 
02:30:49.030 --> 02:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
evidence that this person was rearrested
 
02:30:51.710 --> 02:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
was out on bail um and you know when we
 
02:30:53.630 --> 02:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
started this conversation last session
 
02:30:56.309 --> 02:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
around the horrific murder in Manchester
 
02:30:58.550 --> 02:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
um Professor shur actually dug into the
 
02:31:00.510 --> 02:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
facts in that case and it had nothing to
 
02:31:01.910 --> 02:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
do with the failure of the bail system
 
02:31:04.030 --> 02:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
it had to do with the fact that lawyers
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
did not prosecutors did not use the
 
02:31:07.269 --> 02:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
tools that they had and it wasn't even
 
02:31:08.710 --> 02:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
about a bail commissioner it was judges
 
02:31:11.309 --> 02:31:11.319 align:start position:0%
who had released the the individual I I
 
02:31:13.190 --> 02:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
don't think I don't think anyone on the
 
02:31:15.950 --> 02:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
committee um would argue that that
 
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
necessary neily that the crime rates are
 
02:31:21.469 --> 02:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
not down but we are concerned about is
 
02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
the the the numbers of people who are
 
02:31:25.870 --> 02:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
are rearrested while they were on bail
 
02:31:27.870 --> 02:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
is what seems to be driving the
 
02:31:30.429 --> 02:31:30.439 align:start position:0%
consternation of the um the Manchester
 
02:31:32.190 --> 02:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
public and that's the problem we have is
 
02:31:34.830 --> 02:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
with the data once again it's how do we
 
02:31:38.550 --> 02:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
get it I mean do do you have any way to
 
02:31:40.309 --> 02:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
to to get that kind of data yeah and
 
02:31:42.309 --> 02:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
that's we I think there's two issues one
 
02:31:44.790 --> 02:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
is why we so support your realtime bail
 
02:31:47.269 --> 02:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
tracking system so that everyone has all
 
02:31:49.070 --> 02:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
the information in front of them and
 
02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
there are other states that have done
 
02:31:52.990 --> 02:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
bail data collection New York state for
 
02:31:55.429 --> 02:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
one has done bail data collection um and
 
02:31:56.790 --> 02:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
I think the findings there have been
 
02:31:58.870 --> 02:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
actually helpful from a bail reform
 
02:32:00.630 --> 02:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
perspective um so there's definitely
 
02:32:01.950 --> 02:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
models that we could take I mean they
 
02:32:04.710 --> 02:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
cost money yeah um but I think you know
 
02:32:06.110 --> 02:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
we were talking about spending money on
 
02:32:07.510 --> 02:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
any of these Solutions I think it would
 
02:32:08.950 --> 02:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
be most appropriate to put the money
 
02:32:10.389 --> 02:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
into things that will actually get us
 
02:32:12.590 --> 02:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
the data to make informed decisions I
 
02:32:14.110 --> 02:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
guess my question was kind of rhetorical
 
02:32:15.110 --> 02:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
because I don't think there's a way you
 
02:32:17.790 --> 02:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
could get the data for him right now on
 
02:32:19.950 --> 02:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
who's been rearrested across the state
 
02:32:21.910 --> 02:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
on bail and I think one other thing to
 
02:32:23.950 --> 02:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
lift up as well is and and it would
 
02:32:25.630 --> 02:32:25.640 align:start position:0%
maybe be helpful to get someone in who
 
02:32:27.070 --> 02:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
really focuses on this but my
 
02:32:28.269 --> 02:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
understanding too is there are federal
 
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
dollars available for updating court
 
02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
systems um and so this also could be
 
02:32:34.510 --> 02:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
done potentially in a way that doesn't
 
02:32:36.630 --> 02:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal note for the State of New
 
02:32:39.269 --> 02:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or at least minimize the
 
02:32:40.870 --> 02:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on a state of New Hampshire
 
02:32:43.429 --> 02:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to hear anything about that
 
02:32:46.070 --> 02:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
so if you have it please send it our way
 
02:32:48.230 --> 02:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
um does anyone have any questions from
 
02:32:51.830 --> 02:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
Mr Knack I do I do okay you go ahead you
 
02:32:53.510 --> 02:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
haven't asked any questions yet no I got
 
02:32:56.550 --> 02:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
a question uh do you believe bail
 
02:32:58.590 --> 02:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
bondsman should be
 
02:33:00.830 --> 02:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
judges the bail bondsmen or bail
 
02:33:00.840 --> 02:33:02.230 align:start position:0%
judges the bail bondsmen or bail
Commissioners

02:33:02.230 --> 02:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
Commissioners
 
02:33:05.070 --> 02:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry which well I you you
 
02:33:06.550 --> 02:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
talked about varying amounts and
 
02:33:07.950 --> 02:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
different crimes instead of just saying
 
02:33:10.309 --> 02:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
a crime you want like a different levels
 
02:33:12.349 --> 02:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
of a different crime stalking is a
 
02:33:14.990 --> 02:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
serious thing staring uh is a
 
02:33:17.070 --> 02:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
progressive crime starts out as one
 
02:33:18.510 --> 02:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
level it goes to the next level it goes
 
02:33:19.630 --> 02:33:19.640 align:start position:0%
to the next level just like child
 
02:33:21.550 --> 02:33:21.560 align:start position:0%
pornography starts off with pitches but
 
02:33:24.030 --> 02:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
it goes up and up and up so I don't
 
02:33:26.349 --> 02:33:26.359 align:start position:0%
think you can take different levels of a
 
02:33:29.469 --> 02:33:29.479 align:start position:0%
crime and have a baales bondsman uh be
 
02:33:31.309 --> 02:33:31.319 align:start position:0%
responsible for deciding if he's at
 
02:33:33.230 --> 02:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
level one level two level three I think
 
02:33:35.429 --> 02:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
all you're doing uh the purpose of the
 
02:33:37.590 --> 02:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
bailes bond is to protect the safety of
 
02:33:39.309 --> 02:33:39.319 align:start position:0%
the public so if you have somebody
 
02:33:41.469 --> 02:33:41.479 align:start position:0%
that's on one of those steps you only
 
02:33:43.230 --> 02:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
ask them to be detained until the point
 
02:33:44.710 --> 02:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
that a judge can make a decision where
 
02:33:47.550 --> 02:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
that person should be released mm
 
02:33:49.230 --> 02:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
I think that's I'm sorry you agree with
 
02:33:50.710 --> 02:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
that I think that's the beauty of our
 
02:33:52.910 --> 02:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
current system is it allows for that if
 
02:33:54.790 --> 02:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
as we heard from um representative
 
02:33:56.510 --> 02:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
scitec if a bail commissioner is not
 
02:33:59.550 --> 02:33:59.560 align:start position:0%
sure then the judge can can look at that
 
02:34:01.309 --> 02:34:01.319 align:start position:0%
case um so I think that's what we want
 
02:34:02.830 --> 02:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we have that
 
02:34:05.590 --> 02:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
individualized versus a blanket we you
 
02:34:07.710 --> 02:34:07.720 align:start position:0%
know and so also I mean it's I think
 
02:34:09.230 --> 02:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
it's important to remember that these
 
02:34:11.950 --> 02:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
charges are just what the police have
 
02:34:14.190 --> 02:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
brought often times prosecutors once
 
02:34:15.910 --> 02:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
they get the case File will realize oh
 
02:34:18.590 --> 02:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
this is way overcharged and will reduce
 
02:34:20.670 --> 02:34:20.680 align:start position:0%
and so I think it's important that we we
 
02:34:22.349 --> 02:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
get away from these like just you know
 
02:34:24.110 --> 02:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
one size fits-all approaches and have
 
02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
individualized assessments that kind of
 
02:34:27.950 --> 02:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
brought me to my next question uh you
 
02:34:30.950 --> 02:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
think the police followup please thank
 
02:34:33.590 --> 02:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
you so um do you believe the police are
 
02:34:36.349 --> 02:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
erroneously arresting people or I'm
 
02:34:37.870 --> 02:34:37.880 align:start position:0%
sorry do you think people are the police
 
02:34:39.389 --> 02:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
are erroneously arresting people
 
02:34:42.429 --> 02:34:42.439 align:start position:0%
erroneously yes um I don't believe the
 
02:34:44.950 --> 02:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
police erroneously I'm not alleging that
 
02:34:47.150 --> 02:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
the police erroneously arrest people but
 
02:34:50.469 --> 02:34:50.479 align:start position:0%
you know um I in an earlier job I was
 
02:34:52.750 --> 02:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
the I ran the Montana Innocence Project
 
02:34:55.070 --> 02:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
and so we worked to free people who were
 
02:34:57.309 --> 02:34:57.319 align:start position:0%
wrongfully convicted and if you actually
 
02:34:59.550 --> 02:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
look at the National Data thousands and
 
02:35:01.309 --> 02:35:01.319 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of people have
 
02:35:04.190 --> 02:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
been exonerated um because the state got
 
02:35:06.030 --> 02:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
it wrong and so I think it's really
 
02:35:07.910 --> 02:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
important to remember that the state is
 
02:35:10.550 --> 02:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
not always right and so having
 
02:35:12.550 --> 02:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
individualized versus blanket I think is
 
02:35:13.990 --> 02:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
better and so the I'm not saying the
 
02:35:15.349 --> 02:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
police are intentionally doing anything
 
02:35:17.269 --> 02:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
but everyone police are human everyone
 
02:35:19.590 --> 02:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
makes mistakes so it sounds like the
 
02:35:22.309 --> 02:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
system worked I'm sorry sounds like the
 
02:35:24.070 --> 02:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
system worked if somebody got by
 
02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
accident get stopped and uh get arrested
 
02:35:29.710 --> 02:35:29.720 align:start position:0%
then it works no I think I think the the
 
02:35:31.510 --> 02:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
Innocence case I brought up is how the
 
02:35:34.429 --> 02:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
system didn't work but for the fact that
 
02:35:37.230 --> 02:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
there are nonprofits of that have
 
02:35:39.469 --> 02:35:39.479 align:start position:0%
private dollars raised those people
 
02:35:41.429 --> 02:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
would still be sitting in jail the state
 
02:35:43.110 --> 02:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
didn't do anything to get those people
 
02:35:44.910 --> 02:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
out the state actually fought all those
 
02:35:46.550 --> 02:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
cases tooth and nail
 
02:35:48.230 --> 02:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't because the system was
 
02:35:50.830 --> 02:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
working it was because nonprofits came
 
02:35:52.630 --> 02:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
together and realized that there was a
 
02:35:54.030 --> 02:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
fundamental flaw in the way the state
 
02:35:56.469 --> 02:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
was operating and so we still have
 
02:35:58.950 --> 02:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
efforts to fix laws that we have decid
 
02:36:01.070 --> 02:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
you know even in New Hampshire there's
 
02:36:03.910 --> 02:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
legislation every year around um um um
 
02:36:05.830 --> 02:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
recording of police interrogations
 
02:36:08.950 --> 02:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
because we know from innocent work that
 
02:36:11.790 --> 02:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
police um that that false confessions
 
02:36:13.950 --> 02:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
happen they don't they happen for Myriad
 
02:36:16.429 --> 02:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
reasons um that have to do with bi you
 
02:36:19.710 --> 02:36:19.720 align:start position:0%
know brain science Etc um particularly
 
02:36:23.150 --> 02:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
with youth um and so instead of actually
 
02:36:25.950 --> 02:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
you know when when um I guess look at it
 
02:36:28.950 --> 02:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
this way when a plane crashes what
 
02:36:31.230 --> 02:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
happens we look at all the facts why did
 
02:36:32.790 --> 02:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
that plane crash and then we do
 
02:36:34.550 --> 02:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
everything we can to mitigate the
 
02:36:37.190 --> 02:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
chances of that ever happening again so
 
02:36:39.150 --> 02:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
they'll do safety new safety protocols
 
02:36:41.950 --> 02:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
Etc same when someone dies in a hospital
 
02:36:44.230 --> 02:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
but when there's a wrongful conviction
 
02:36:45.950 --> 02:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
that the actual opposite happens there's
 
02:36:48.150 --> 02:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
no effort by the state to figure out why
 
02:36:50.269 --> 02:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
did this happen and how can we take
 
02:36:51.790 --> 02:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
steps immediately to make sure this
 
02:36:54.309 --> 02:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
never happens again it's only because of
 
02:36:56.070 --> 02:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
U nonprofit groups that any of those
 
02:36:58.910 --> 02:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
reforms really ever happen Okay well
 
02:37:00.870 --> 02:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
we're we're getting far field now so
 
02:37:02.510 --> 02:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's all right um
 
02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
representative uh Stone and then
 
02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:05.790 align:start position:0%
representative uh Stone and then
representative

02:37:05.790 --> 02:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:37:08.710 --> 02:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
Muse real quickly on the issue of the
 
02:37:10.910 --> 02:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
data has anything been given for this
 
02:37:12.830 --> 02:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
data collection involving the reduction
 
02:37:14.990 --> 02:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
of police across the state including
 
02:37:16.389 --> 02:37:16.399 align:start position:0%
Manchester where I'm sure they've had
 
02:37:17.910 --> 02:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
their staff shortages obviously if you
 
02:37:20.070 --> 02:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
have less police officers you have less
 
02:37:21.630 --> 02:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
uh activity and actual work being
 
02:37:23.429 --> 02:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
produced has that been put into this
 
02:37:25.750 --> 02:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
factor for these numbers I don't know if
 
02:37:27.950 --> 02:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
that's been put in but also this has
 
02:37:29.910 --> 02:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
crimes which are not necessar I mean
 
02:37:32.030 --> 02:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
those are often Community initiated you
 
02:37:34.710 --> 02:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
know reported and crimes are also down
 
02:37:36.510 --> 02:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
substantially and just follow up these
 
02:37:38.790 --> 02:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
going to be any designation for multiple
 
02:37:40.870 --> 02:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
Crimes by the same defendant it's the
 
02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
same methodology AC it's the way it's
 
02:37:44.389 --> 02:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
been reported to the state so I wouldn't
 
02:37:46.190 --> 02:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
imagine things like that I assume the
 
02:37:47.349 --> 02:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
state has always used the same
 
02:37:48.910 --> 02:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
methodology if they're reporting it the
 
02:37:50.990 --> 02:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
same way yeah the data that he's given
 
02:37:53.110 --> 02:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
us is just data that the police reported
 
02:37:55.630 --> 02:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Justice so um
 
02:37:57.830 --> 02:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
whatever they got is what we got
 
02:37:57.840 --> 02:38:00.110 align:start position:0%
whatever they got is what we got
representative

02:38:00.110 --> 02:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:38:04.670 --> 02:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you um something that uh
 
02:38:08.429 --> 02:38:08.439 align:start position:0%
Professor Sher said um really did catch
 
02:38:12.349 --> 02:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
my ear and it's the fact that uh lists
 
02:38:14.030 --> 02:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
like the ones that we're looking at
 
02:38:16.389 --> 02:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
become a lot less relevant in if another
 
02:38:18.830 --> 02:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
part of the law requires people to
 
02:38:22.070 --> 02:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
actually see a judge within 24 hours uh
 
02:38:24.990 --> 02:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
which uh which he was saying meets
 
02:38:27.030 --> 02:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirements in in in a
 
02:38:29.190 --> 02:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
in a bunch of states and seems to be a
 
02:38:30.550 --> 02:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
good ongoing
 
02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:32.550 align:start position:0%
good ongoing
practice

02:38:32.550 --> 02:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
practice
 
02:38:35.389 --> 02:38:35.399 align:start position:0%
what what it seems to me that we might
 
02:38:37.710 --> 02:38:37.720 align:start position:0%
be able to do is to craft something that
 
02:38:40.790 --> 02:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
has a list of some of these crimes and
 
02:38:43.630 --> 02:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
and essentially what it would become is
 
02:38:45.990 --> 02:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
a list of offenses where the bail
 
02:38:50.030 --> 02:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner doesn't have discretion um
 
02:38:52.590 --> 02:38:52.600 align:start position:0%
but uh there is a a requirement that if
 
02:38:54.070 --> 02:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
you're accused of committing one of
 
02:38:57.429 --> 02:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
these crimes uh that you have to see a
 
02:39:00.030 --> 02:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
judge within within 24
 
02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:01.910 align:start position:0%
judge within within 24
hours

02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
hours
 
02:39:05.309 --> 02:39:05.319 align:start position:0%
um I guess what I'm searching for is we
 
02:39:07.790 --> 02:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
we've spent a lot of time in past
 
02:39:09.389 --> 02:39:09.399 align:start position:0%
committee sessions kind of reviewing the
 
02:39:11.070 --> 02:39:11.080 align:start position:0%
list of crimes and trying to pick out
 
02:39:13.309 --> 02:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
the ones that might touch on misdemeanor
 
02:39:15.150 --> 02:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors and which ones might be a
 
02:39:17.630 --> 02:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
little more dangerous than others and
 
02:39:20.110 --> 02:39:20.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering does that whole
 
02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:21.550 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering does that whole
conversation

02:39:21.550 --> 02:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
02:39:25.910 --> 02:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
become a whole lot less relevant if we
 
02:39:28.790 --> 02:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
have a 24-hour limitation so if we if we
 
02:39:31.790 --> 02:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
basically shrink that amount of time
 
02:39:33.469 --> 02:39:33.479 align:start position:0%
maximum amount of time people can be
 
02:39:34.950 --> 02:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
held without seeing a
 
02:39:37.389 --> 02:39:37.399 align:start position:0%
judge for all intents and purposes does
 
02:39:39.670 --> 02:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of this go away from a
 
02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:40.950 align:start position:0%
a lot of this go away from a
constitutional

02:39:40.950 --> 02:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
02:39:43.349 --> 02:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
perspective I think as I think Professor
 
02:39:44.950 --> 02:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
Sher spoke about the Constitutional
 
02:39:47.910 --> 02:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
issues there and that restricts or
 
02:39:49.870 --> 02:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
minimizes the chance of a concern there
 
02:39:52.309 --> 02:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
and I would really defer to him on on on
 
02:39:55.790 --> 02:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
that answer um I think you know two
 
02:39:58.349 --> 02:39:58.359 align:start position:0%
things from our perspective um you know
 
02:39:59.830 --> 02:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
I think while we would definitely
 
02:40:02.349 --> 02:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
support reducing that to 24 hours I
 
02:40:03.550 --> 02:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
think it's also important to remember
 
02:40:04.950 --> 02:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
that for someone who's like a shift
 
02:40:07.830 --> 02:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
worker or a primary caregiver 24 hours
 
02:40:09.950 --> 02:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
is eternity you can lose your job you
 
02:40:12.590 --> 02:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
can you know your kids don't have access
 
02:40:16.190 --> 02:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
um I think what we'd be more um I think
 
02:40:18.750 --> 02:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
lean towards would be you know under
 
02:40:20.870 --> 02:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
existing law prosecutors can challenge
 
02:40:23.910 --> 02:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
any release order they disagree with um
 
02:40:25.630 --> 02:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
but the very valid argument has been
 
02:40:27.710 --> 02:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
brought up by those who say that well
 
02:40:30.309 --> 02:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
that person's then been released and you
 
02:40:32.309 --> 02:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
know then it's too late so I think you
 
02:40:34.830 --> 02:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
know one possible Avenue would be to
 
02:40:37.790 --> 02:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
amend the law to basically allow for you
 
02:40:41.670 --> 02:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
know if the the the um the state says
 
02:40:43.590 --> 02:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
you know the bail commissioner releases
 
02:40:45.510 --> 02:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
the state says for X Y or Z reason
 
02:40:47.469 --> 02:40:47.479 align:start position:0%
reasons we think you're wrong we think
 
02:40:50.309 --> 02:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
there's a danger because it's in that
 
02:40:52.910 --> 02:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
individualized case that's fact specific
 
02:40:54.910 --> 02:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
that they can they can say we we
 
02:40:57.150 --> 02:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
actually disagree and we want to appeal
 
02:40:59.190 --> 02:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
this and that person would be held 24
 
02:41:02.349 --> 02:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
hours before they got before a judge um
 
02:41:04.190 --> 02:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
I think that would be potentially more
 
02:41:07.150 --> 02:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate because it is fact specific
 
02:41:10.110 --> 02:41:10.120 align:start position:0%
case specific individual specific and
 
02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
not just because someone was alleged to
 
02:41:15.110 --> 02:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
have committed a certain offense type um
 
02:41:17.550 --> 02:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
I def think you know in all the worlds
 
02:41:18.990 --> 02:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
that have been brought before this
 
02:41:21.150 --> 02:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
committee that would be you know I think
 
02:41:22.389 --> 02:41:22.399 align:start position:0%
the most appropriate from our
 
02:41:24.150 --> 02:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
perspective but what Professor shur
 
02:41:26.590 --> 02:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
talked about of having a limited number
 
02:41:29.309 --> 02:41:29.319 align:start position:0%
would maybe be like a you know a median
 
02:41:32.790 --> 02:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
you know you know median position um but
 
02:41:34.269 --> 02:41:34.279 align:start position:0%
yeah I think our our main concern is
 
02:41:35.269 --> 02:41:35.279 align:start position:0%
what's been brought before this
 
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
committee from the Senate which are just
 
02:41:38.750 --> 02:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
you know whole host of offense types
 
02:41:41.190 --> 02:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
we're talking thousands of people no
 
02:41:42.950 --> 02:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
specific Nexus that that person is
 
02:41:45.429 --> 02:41:45.439 align:start position:0%
actually a danger or a Flight Risk um
 
02:41:46.510 --> 02:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
and but we're going to hold them we're
 
02:41:47.870 --> 02:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
going to hold them for a bunch of days
 
02:41:49.830 --> 02:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
and that's extremely problematic not
 
02:41:51.429 --> 02:41:51.439 align:start position:0%
only for the individual their families
 
02:41:53.750 --> 02:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
and also I I provided in the in the
 
02:41:55.590 --> 02:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
handout also the research shows from a
 
02:41:57.110 --> 02:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
public safety perspective that actually
 
02:42:00.790 --> 02:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:03.030 --> 02:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
safe thank you and and also thank you
 
02:42:05.389 --> 02:42:05.399 align:start position:0%
for the work um in going through the
 
02:42:07.349 --> 02:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
statutes and pulling some of this uh
 
02:42:10.710 --> 02:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
stuff out for us it's going to be very
 
02:42:13.870 --> 02:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you thank you so much um
 
02:42:14.950 --> 02:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else here who wasn't
 
02:42:17.870 --> 02:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
testified wishes to testify
 
02:42:22.950 --> 02:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
today okay seeing none um at this point
 
02:42:25.510 --> 02:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
um there's there's several other um
 
02:42:26.830 --> 02:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
committees I believe that are starting
 
02:42:30.309 --> 02:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
at 1:00 that some people need to go to
 
02:42:31.830 --> 02:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
um I think we've taken in a lot of
 
02:42:34.670 --> 02:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
information today um I think that it
 
02:42:37.550 --> 02:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
would behoove us all to um take that
 
02:42:40.110 --> 02:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
think about it and I think um when we
 
02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
meet again next Thursday we're going to
 
02:42:46.070 --> 02:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
start with a a a a working a working
 
02:42:48.670 --> 02:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
document that we can all start to
 
02:42:50.790 --> 02:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
actually flesh out and and start putting
 
02:42:54.469 --> 02:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
some some beef on the bone as it were um
 
02:42:56.910 --> 02:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
and and just to be clear we're going to
 
02:43:00.349 --> 02:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
be taking um taking some votes but
 
02:43:01.990 --> 02:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to be uh nonbinding
 
02:43:03.429 --> 02:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be the final votes
 
02:43:05.190 --> 02:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
just so so we can kind of see where we
 
02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
are and how far apart we are if we are
 
02:43:10.349 --> 02:43:10.359 align:start position:0%
on certain issues so we can narrow it so
 
02:43:12.030 --> 02:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
um I would encourage everyone to take
 
02:43:13.150 --> 02:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
everything we got today all the
 
02:43:16.030 --> 02:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
testimony we got do your research search
 
02:43:17.950 --> 02:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
um talk to your constituents see where
 
02:43:21.190 --> 02:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
you are and when we meet again next week
 
02:43:24.550 --> 02:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to present um an
 
02:43:27.070 --> 02:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
outline um from at least my perspective
 
02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
where I think we should start of course
 
02:43:30.870 --> 02:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
everyone's free and actually I hope will
 
02:43:34.070 --> 02:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
everyone add to that and um we'll we'll
 
02:43:37.030 --> 02:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
see where we stand on the issue of the
 
02:43:40.830 --> 02:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
crimes and people being held um and
 
02:43:43.750 --> 02:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully Thursday we can move on after
 
02:43:45.750 --> 02:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
that Friday to start the next portion of
 
02:43:47.950 --> 02:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
it does everyone agree with that does
 
02:43:51.910 --> 02:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:54.070 --> 02:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
add uh representative
 
02:43:57.150 --> 02:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
scitech um I may be close to an apology
 
02:44:00.990 --> 02:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
to uh um prosecutor Jordan I had it
 
02:44:03.349 --> 02:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
wrong about the breach of bail business
 
02:44:07.110 --> 02:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
I was told not by him by someone else I
 
02:44:09.030 --> 02:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
don't have that situation so I was over
 
02:44:12.070 --> 02:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
my head and I'm sorry I said more than I
 
02:44:15.070 --> 02:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
should have I'm sorry and I'm sure he's
 
02:44:16.710 --> 02:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh he's
 
02:44:21.349 --> 02:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
okay um we will um we we'll be moving on
 
02:44:24.710 --> 02:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
after this um so just to once you've if
 
02:44:26.389 --> 02:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
you feel like you you're ready for
 
02:44:30.110 --> 02:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
meeting next Thursday I think after that
 
02:44:32.830 --> 02:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to be discussing on Friday
 
02:44:34.990 --> 02:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
the actual issue of of the bail
 
02:44:37.990 --> 02:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and their um being paid
 
02:44:41.429 --> 02:44:41.439 align:start position:0%
and how to handle that so that'll be the
 
02:44:42.950 --> 02:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
next topic that we'll be taking up on
 
02:44:44.830 --> 02:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
Friday did you have something you look
 
02:44:46.870 --> 02:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
like I just have a comment I mean I
 
02:44:48.710 --> 02:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
think it would be helpful if we had more
 
02:44:51.870 --> 02:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
victim statements you know I think that
 
02:44:54.469 --> 02:44:54.479 align:start position:0%
that would um give a a much needed
 
02:44:56.429 --> 02:44:56.439 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint we I thank you for your
 
02:44:59.269 --> 02:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
testimony but that was just one and I
 
02:45:02.710 --> 02:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
think to make a a well-informed choice
 
02:45:05.030 --> 02:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
we should really be able to hear from
 
02:45:07.790 --> 02:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
the the victim side as well I I would um
 
02:45:10.190 --> 02:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
say that um from now until November 3rd
 
02:45:11.750 --> 02:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to hear anyone who comes
 
02:45:13.389 --> 02:45:13.399 align:start position:0%
before the committee and wishes to offer
 
02:45:15.429 --> 02:45:15.439 align:start position:0%
any so if you have someone you know if
 
02:45:17.030 --> 02:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
someone you'd like to come speak to us
 
02:45:19.469 --> 02:45:19.479 align:start position:0%
um I'll start we are very uh I'm I'm
 
02:45:22.950 --> 02:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
running a very open deal here so I want
 
02:45:24.710 --> 02:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
to hear from everybody all sides of the
 
02:45:26.710 --> 02:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
argument and then we'll come together
 
02:45:29.710 --> 02:45:29.720 align:start position:0%
somehow thanks um as a matter of fact I
 
02:45:31.550 --> 02:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
probably am going to reach out myself to
 
02:45:34.230 --> 02:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence Coalition and they
 
02:45:37.150 --> 02:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
will probably have um plenty plenty to
 
02:45:39.950 --> 02:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
say on that issue um but I'm not
 
02:45:41.590 --> 02:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily sure based on what I'm
 
02:45:42.990 --> 02:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
thinking right now we need it for
 
02:45:45.870 --> 02:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
Thursday but if you have someone you'd
 
02:45:48.790 --> 02:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
like to bring that's fine um with that
 
02:45:50.309 --> 02:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
um no one else has anything to say we're
 
02:45:52.429 --> 02:45:52.439 align:start position:0%
going to recess until next Thursday at
 
02:45:52.439 --> 02:46:13.990 align:start position:0%
going to recess until next Thursday at
10:00

02:46:13.990 --> 02:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
a.m.
