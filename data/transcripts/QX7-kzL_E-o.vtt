00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair members of the
 
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 align:start position:0%
I believe we left off on page 37 of our
 
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
presentation we were just about to start
 
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
the interest in dividends tax
 
00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
which Keane is going to cover Chris does
 
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
have extra copies if anyone needs them
 
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
and before we get started on the
 
00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends does anybody have
 
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
any questions on the other taxes that we
 
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
have covered previously
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
and obviously if you do you know we can
 
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
we can get back to that too at the end
 
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
but um if anyone had anything pressing
 
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 align:start position:0%
right now we could
 
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 align:start position:0%
address that
 
00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I think we'll
 
00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
continue with interest and dividends
 
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
good morning uh Kimi Wong Department of
 
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.990 align:start position:0%
good morning uh Kimi Wong Department of
Revenue

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
so right now we are on page 37 of the
 
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.550 align:start position:0%
so right now we are on page 37 of the
slide

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
slide
 
00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 align:start position:0%
and we're starting off with interest in
 
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax is currently
 
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
um for taxable periods ending on or
 
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
after December 31 2023 is at four
 
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
percent tax rate uh prior to that it's
 
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
at a five percent uh tax rate and this
 
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
tax rate is uh decreasing year over year
 
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
and will be repeal effective uh Jan 1 of
 
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
2027. all New Hampshire residents

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
currently the threshold for uh the
 
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
filing as well as income exemption is uh
 
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
2 400 annually and 4 800 for joint

as well as for our buying and disabled
 
00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 align:start position:0%
similarly 1200 exemptions
 
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
the return is filed on April 15th it was
 
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
due on April 15th and uh similar with
 
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
the business taxes as an extension to
 
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 align:start position:0%

able to file that return on time however
 
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
that's just to file a return it's not to
 
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
pay the taxes
 
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
and uh similar with the BPT there's also
 
00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
the um requirement to pay estimated
 
00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 align:start position:0%
taxes and this will these estimated
 
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
taxes uh due on April 15th June 15
 
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
September 15 and January 15th
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
um of the Year itself
 
00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419 align:start position:0%
um if they estimated liabilities in
 
00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
moving on to page 38
 
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
this is the uh the so data that shows
 
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
the split uh the the breakdown of the uh
 
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
the filers so on the left hand side you
 
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
will have the pie chart to show the
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
large amount of filers uh individuals at
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
97.5 percent and uh 2.5 percent of them
 
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh of the filers are Partnerships in the
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
states however when you look at the
 
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax breakdown you
 
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:22.940 align:start position:0%
see that um the 39 that from this filing
 
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
what exactly is the portion that income
 
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
portion that makes up these uh taxable
 
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.710 align:start position:0%
portion that makes up these uh taxable
IND

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
IND
 
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
ual see here the large amount of that
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
will be a 39 is from dividends and then
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
42 percent is from distribution
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
um you've heard the distinguishing
 
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
um language between okay what's the
 
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
dividend and what's a distribution
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
essentially this dividends would be uh
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
the dividends that you receive normally
 
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
when you receive a 1099 div and you
 
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
report that on your federal return on
 
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
your 1040
 
00:07:59.930 --> 00:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
Top Line there are dividend income and
 
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:02.120 align:start position:0%
then distribution would be uh
 
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
distribution would be any kind of
 
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:06.060 align:start position:0%
distribution of cash or property that's
 
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
distributed from an escrow trust in the
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
states Partnerships and LLCs those are
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
distributions and those are treated as
 
00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
moving on to slide 39
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
this graph shows the uh the 10 years of
 
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
the interest and dividend components for
 
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
the for a 10-year Trend so this is a
 
00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
interesting dividend component not the
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
the tax itself so this is what is
 
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
the the components that makes up the the
 
00:08:44.089 --> 00:08:44.099 align:start position:0%
IND income once again you'll see the
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
texture 21 you'll see the
 
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
large portion of it is from
 
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
distributions and dividends and the
 
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
small portion is from interest income
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
and then looking down at the the chart
 
00:08:59.570 --> 00:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
at the bottom and you'll see actually
 
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:01.860 align:start position:0%
provide you with the uh the numbers in
 
00:09:03.889 --> 00:09:03.899 align:start position:0%
billions and that will correlate with
 
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
moving on to like 40 it is the IND tax
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
revenue for a 10-year Trend and you see
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
that the um
 
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
the IND income is trending upwards and
 
00:09:24.769 --> 00:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
then in fiskier 21 there's a slight
 
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
downward Trend and then fiscal year 282
 
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
it's going up uh as well and likely the
 
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
influencing factors on this white fiscal
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
year 22 is moving so just drastically up
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
is likely because of as you see from the
 
00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
previous Slide the last portion of the
 
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
IND is from distributions and dividends
 
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
so likely the the payout from dividend
 
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
and distributions has increased for
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal 20 to as well as also the
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:08.329 --> 00:10:08.339 align:start position:0%
representative doors
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
taking my question is any of this uh
 
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
increased do you think related to covid
 
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
or is it just people are taking
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
advantage of they're just you know their
 
00:10:24.889 --> 00:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the uh in terms of the
 
00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:29.459 align:start position:0%
the 10-year Revenue Trend yes and where
 
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
it's spiking here at the end a little
 
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
bit in 22.
 
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:37.740 align:start position:0%
um in terms of covet I I the covet
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
impact were likely that would impact the
 
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
IND Revenue would likely be from the
 
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.490 align:start position:0%
IND Revenue would likely be from the
Federal

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
money coming in to to businesses and if
 
00:10:48.889 --> 00:10:48.899 align:start position:0%
the businesses are doing well and they
 
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
distribute and and provide higher
 
00:10:53.329 --> 00:10:53.339 align:start position:0%
distributions and dividends to to their
 
00:10:56.449 --> 00:10:56.459 align:start position:0%
shareholders or members uh that you ever
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
would you'll see that direct correlation
 
00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:01.019 align:start position:0%
into in terms of the increase in the uh
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
in the IND Revenue okay um I think that
 
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
would be the the direct
 
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:09.180 align:start position:0%
um or indirect yeah correlation okay
 
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:17.850 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:22.250 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
would we had the tax cuts and jobs act
 
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
and on
 
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:31.740 align:start position:0%
As I understood it a large part of the
 
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
prophets from
 
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.329 align:start position:0%
prophets from
on

00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:35.339 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
that that went to large corporations
 
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
ended up coming coming back as profits
 
00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:46.019 align:start position:0%
to us so so we've had this artificial
 
00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
stimulus and that one I understand a
 
00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
fair amount of that act is is ending
 
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.190 align:start position:0%
fair amount of that act is is ending
soon

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
soon
 
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
could you yes tell us about that
 
00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
yes representative so that bit on the uh
 
00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:03.899 align:start position:0%
the tcja
 
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
um that that we've
 
00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
that we uh sorry so the tcga re changed
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
the tax structure and required a uh a
 
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
deemed distribution uh from foreign
 
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:20.700 align:start position:0%
dividends coming back into New Hampshire
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh sorry into the US so essentially that
 
00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
impacts the BPT more
 
00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
um and we're treating that as uh when on
 
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
the federal side when there's a
 
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
requirement to report it as a deemed
 
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.069 align:start position:0%
requirement to report it as a deemed
distribution

00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
and um so there is no sort of incentive
 
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
for the companies to keep the money
 
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
offshore and it therefore actually make
 
00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
an actual distribution back to the U.S
 
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.129 align:start position:0%
an actual distribution back to the U.S
holders

00:12:46.129 --> 00:12:46.139 align:start position:0%
holders
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire taxes the uh dividends
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
foreign dividends when they actually
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
received by by the U.S holders and so
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
when they actually do that we do the
 
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
actual distribution that's when we
 
00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up to that one on but
 
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
also they although there were quite a
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
few businesses that weren't paying what
 
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
they were supposed to be paying uh there
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
was on a
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
on a cut in the the amount of tax that
 
00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:26.339 align:start position:0%
the corporations had to pay at the same
 
00:13:26.339 --> 00:13:27.470 align:start position:0%
the corporations had to pay at the same
time

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:31.019 align:start position:0%
and I think I remember that that that
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
was only in order to meet budget
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
criteria it was only authorized for a
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
certain number of years and that that's
 
00:13:38.279 --> 00:13:39.530 align:start position:0%
certain number of years and that that's
ending

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
ending
 
00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
or some part of it is ending
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
there are Provisions within tcga that
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
kind of phase out or change over time so
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
that might be what you're referring to
 
00:13:53.329 --> 00:13:53.339 align:start position:0%
that some of the the changes will phase
 
00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
out or change as years go on to answer
 
00:13:59.329 --> 00:13:59.339 align:start position:0%
your first question though I think it's
 
00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
similar to the question about covid so
 
00:14:03.889 --> 00:14:03.899 align:start position:0%
to the extent that that money was
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
repatriated back to the United States
 
00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
and then those corporations decided to
 
00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:09.899 align:start position:0%
make distributions or dividends with
 
00:14:11.329 --> 00:14:11.339 align:start position:0%
some of those profits that came back
 
00:14:14.449 --> 00:14:14.459 align:start position:0%
then we would see that impact in IND as
 
00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
well so although to Keane's point the
 
00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:20.339 align:start position:0%
foreign dividend paid back to the U.S
 
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:23.700 align:start position:0%
entity would be a taxable event for BPT
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
purposes if that profit then further
 
00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:28.100 align:start position:0%
shifted to
 
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
shareholders or members based on
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
dividends or distributions we would see
 
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
that here so it's kind of a two-step
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and then follow up can I this
 
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
isn't a follow-up so if someone else has
 
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:14:47.329 --> 00:14:47.339 align:start position:0%
right okay we'll go to representative
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
uluri and then we'll go around again
 
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you just
 
00:14:55.009 --> 00:14:55.019 align:start position:0%
chair so if I understand what you're
 
00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:56.449 align:start position:0%
chair so if I understand what you're
saying

00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:56.459 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
because the
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
job jobs and taxi whatever the hell it's
 
00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.350 align:start position:0%
job jobs and taxi whatever the hell it's
called

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
called
 
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
which is supposed to Sunset I think in
 
00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.889 align:start position:0%
which is supposed to Sunset I think in
26.

00:15:09.889 --> 00:15:09.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.899 --> 00:15:10.850 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
because that required a repatriation of
 
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
offshore account monies back to the
 
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
United States the profits of the United
 
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
States businesses including those
 
00:15:23.769 --> 00:15:23.779 align:start position:0%
businesses located in New Hampshire
 
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
increased because the profits increased
 
00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
the distribution of interest and
 
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
dividends or dividends in this case from
 
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:35.660 align:start position:0%
The Profit that the company saw
 
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
increased and because the distribution
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
so was the state because we tax it
 
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
where do we stand I think is what
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative almond is trying to get
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
at considering that we're also most
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
likely facing a recession
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
within a couple of quarters
 
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
so to answer that question
 
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it's a hundred percent
 
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
correct to say that the tax cut and jobs
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
act will sunset in 26. there are
 
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:18.660 align:start position:0%
Provisions that are changing
 
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.329 align:start position:0%
Provisions that are changing
the

00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:20.339 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
deemed repatriation was almost like a
 
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
one-time event where the profits for
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
many years that had been held offshore
 
00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
by U.S corporations were deemed to be
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
returned to the U.S and so businesses
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
were able then to actually repatriate
 
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
those profits
 
00:16:41.689 --> 00:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
and not be taxed a second time because
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
it was taxed under the deemed
 
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
repatriation so we kind of saw a
 
00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
one-time impact of that
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
um profits that had been held in foreign
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
entities returned to the U.S the
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
treatment will remain the same going
 
00:16:59.810 --> 00:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
forward so we kind of saw a blip as many
 
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
years of profit were deemed to be
 
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
repatriated but the treatment of those
 
00:17:05.929 --> 00:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
repatriations is going to remain the
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
same going forward so it was a one-time
 
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
event but it also the treatment is going
 
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
to remain the same so the to the extent
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
that businesses continue to repatriate
 
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
those foreign profits and pay out those
 
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
profits via distributions or dividends
 
00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:24.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:26.630 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair okay
 
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
what does that mean as far as Revenue
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
estimates four years out
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
so I think we saw the largest kind of
 
00:17:42.049 --> 00:17:42.059 align:start position:0%
one-time impact when that initial deemed
 
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
repatriation and actual repatriation
 
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
occurred right now I don't anticipate
 
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
but Keane's about to correct me if I'm
 
00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:52.340 align:start position:0%
wrong I don't anticipate significant
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
differences in year over year interest
 
00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
in dividends Revenue as a result of that
 
00:18:00.049 --> 00:18:00.059 align:start position:0%
that we would need to account for
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
we're kind of in a new normal we've seen
 
00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:06.539 align:start position:0%
the impact and I don't think that
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
there's any changes that we need to
 
00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
account for
 
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
in the period that you're going to be
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
and I also just want to add that uh
 
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
deemed repatriation from the tcga that
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
essentially is the mechanism for the
 
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
federal government to change the
 
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
taxation for corporations from a
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
worldwide taxation basis to a more of a
 
00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
territorial basis and to assist in that
 
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
change is required to I can't remember
 
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
the specifics on the policy is that
 
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
they've changed and therefore requiring
 
00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
the uh the treatment of these offshore
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
funds and having them deemed repatriated
 
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
back to the U.S and so that when that
 
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
occurred is to facilitate the transition
 
00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
from the worldwide to the territorial
 
00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.510 align:start position:0%
from the worldwide to the territorial
system

00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
um and if and that's that one-time event
 
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
and we still continue tax on a actual
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
distribution so
 
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
um whenever if the the whenever the
 
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
company's offshore companies find that
 
00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:15.620 align:start position:0%
okay they have uh
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
uh funds offshore that they want to
 
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:20.220 align:start position:0%
actually distribute back to the US that
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
would be when we see
 
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
our BPD going up and if
 
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
following that thought if the company
 
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
would follow continue on to distribute
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
that um that funds to the shareholders
 
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll take that okay
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
so the IND is going away but the
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
money is still going to be there which
 
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
is going to show up on the BPT side
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's correct that all right so it's
 
00:20:06.409 --> 00:20:06.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
it's not really going away
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
so I think the the concept of it going
 
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.529 align:start position:0%
so I think the the concept of it going
away

00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:12.539 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
as Keen just kind of mentioned this
 
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
deemed repatriation that happened at the
 
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
beginning of the tax cut and jobs act
 
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:23.220 align:start position:0%
for federal purposes generated
 
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
um significant amount of taxable profits
 
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
federally right because the amounts were
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
deemed to be repatriated it was many
 
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
years of profits that had been held
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
offshore so the federal government was
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
going to tax a large portion of profits
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
that hadn't been taxable previously that
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
was going to generate a fair amount of
 
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
one-time taxable
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
income for businesses so to help balance
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
that out there were a number of cuts to
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
the federal tax code that occurred at
 
00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
the same time so that businesses did not
 
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
see this significant spike in their
 
00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
taxable liability right so
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
the repatriation was going to increase
 
00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
your taxable liability but there were
 
00:21:06.049 --> 00:21:06.059 align:start position:0%
other Provisions that were going to
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
change or be cut to decrease the taxable
 
00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
liability hoping to end up
 
00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:15.299 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the middle and now what's
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
happening is some of those cuts or
 
00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
decreases in businesses taxable
 
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
liability are starting to phase out as
 
00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
this deemed repatriation has phased in
 
00:21:30.409 --> 00:21:30.419 align:start position:0%
so there was the one-time bump of many
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
years of foreign profits that were
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
taxable now we're just taxing foreign
 
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
profits on more of an ongoing basis and
 
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:40.740 align:start position:0%
so we've as Keane mentioned transitioned
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
to this territorial system where we're
 
00:21:45.289 --> 00:21:45.299 align:start position:0%
kind of trying to get to that middle
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
point so when we talk about certain
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
things in the tax cut and jobs act
 
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
coming to an end it's that phasing out
 
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
as we start to reach this new normal
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
hopefully that makes sense well flat tax
 
00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:15.740 align:start position:0%
I think the uh
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
important question for us as we try to
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
do our Revenue estimates and look to the
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
future is that what's happening as we
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
come off of that
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
first bump
 
00:22:30.169 --> 00:22:30.179 align:start position:0%
and go forward and whether it's going
 
00:22:30.179 --> 00:22:31.370 align:start position:0%
and go forward and whether it's going
forward

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
above where it would have been
 
00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:36.780 align:start position:0%
or not given the very you know other
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
there are lots of elements in this and
 
00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
what I'm wondering is whether any of the
 
00:22:45.549 --> 00:22:45.559 align:start position:0%
National groups study including the
 
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
government have been tracking
 
00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
they um this issue is is pretty
 
00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
fundamental and in terms of what are the
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
profits that are taxable that go into
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
our calculation of of profits
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
so the thing to remember for New
 
00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire purposes with the tax cut and
 
00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
jobs act tcja and this deemed
 
00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:15.059 align:start position:0%
repatriation is New Hampshire is a
 
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
static Conformity state so we conform to
 
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
a specific date of the Internal Revenue
 
00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.529 align:start position:0%
a specific date of the Internal Revenue
code

00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:21.539 align:start position:0%
code
 
00:23:24.649 --> 00:23:24.659 align:start position:0%
not all states operate that way some
 
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
states are what's called rolling
 
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
Conformity where the state just adopts
 
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
the changes to the federal code as they
 
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.149 align:start position:0%
the changes to the federal code as they
happen

00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and many other states are
 
00:23:36.049 --> 00:23:36.059 align:start position:0%
static Conformity so we did not conform
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
to the tax cut and jobs act until after
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
the deemed repatriation had occurred for
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
federal purposes
 
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
so what we see now in New Hampshire in
 
00:23:51.169 --> 00:23:51.179 align:start position:0%
terms of repatriation
 
00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
benefit Revenue impact is when those
 
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
distributions are actually or Dividends
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
are actually paid back from the foreign
 
00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:03.059 align:start position:0%
entity to the United States and those
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
are taxable for New Hampshire purposes
 
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
because at the federal level they have
 
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
been deemed to be repatriated
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
there is an incentive for businesses to
 
00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:18.539 align:start position:0%
actually pay that money back because
 
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
they've already paid tax on it federally
 
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
so when they pay it back in the form of
 
00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:24.299 align:start position:0%
a dividend at the federal government
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
they've already paid tax on it so that
 
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
actual payment is tax-free because it
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
was previously taxed but for New
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire purposes we collect the tax
 
00:24:39.649 --> 00:24:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:45.059 align:start position:0%
so I think the short answer is there is
 
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
a federal incentive to pay that dividend
 
00:24:51.529 --> 00:24:51.539 align:start position:0%
back that didn't exist before the tax
 
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
cut and jobs act and there is a that is
 
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
a taxable event for New Hampshire
 
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
purposes so it is likely that tcja
 
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
um increase the number of dividends that
 
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
were paid back from foreign entities to
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
the U.S therefore increased some portion
 
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
of our BPT base because of it and that
 
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
will remain that way going forward until
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
that provision is removed federally or
 
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
we and we update to a newer version of
 
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
the code
 
00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:23.990 align:start position:0%
the code
foreign

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
so I think at this point given when we
 
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
that tcja
 
00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799 align:start position:0%
that we've been conformed to tcj for a
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
number of years
 
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
I would say that that benefit or that
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
increased Revenue that we see because of
 
00:25:41.279 --> 00:25:42.350 align:start position:0%
increased Revenue that we see because of
the

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
fact that these distributions are deemed
 
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
to be taxable federally and the tax has
 
00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:48.779 align:start position:0%
already been paid that is in our Base
 
00:25:48.779 --> 00:25:49.909 align:start position:0%
already been paid that is in our Base
today

00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
so when you're looking to and we'll talk
 
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:54.059 align:start position:0%
about this in a few slides when we start
 
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
the revenue estimating later this week
 
00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
we're going to look at a base for 23 and
 
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
then a growth rate for 24 and 25. I
 
00:26:03.409 --> 00:26:03.419 align:start position:0%
would say that that that benefit from
 
00:26:09.289 --> 00:26:09.299 align:start position:0%
tcga is in the base of 23. and there is
 
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
at this point no reason that I think we
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
need to make any specific adjustments to
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:21.649 --> 00:26:21.659 align:start position:0%
representative plett
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
my question you referred that we're
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
periodic Conformity static Conformity so
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
we're conforming to 2018 other states
 
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
are continuously moving it up to stay
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
with the feds do you have uh positives
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
or negatives of making that move if we
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
were to develop a instant conformity
 
00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
so with the rolling Conformity
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
um you don't have the opportunity to
 
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
review the changes that the federal
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
government has made and how that will
 
00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
impact your state
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
so the static Conformity that we have we
 
00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
the dra report to this committee and
 
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
Senate Ways and Means in March of every
 
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
year about the changes
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
from the code that we're currently tied
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
to to the current code and we kind of
 
00:27:15.169 --> 00:27:15.179 align:start position:0%
inform you about what changes positive
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
or negative may exist and so you're able
 
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
to make an informed decision states that
 
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
do rolling Conformity again you're kind
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
of at the mercy of the federal
 
00:27:27.769 --> 00:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
government and if they decide to make a
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
change that could be you know
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
potentially detrimental to revenues here
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire you don't have the
 
00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:35.820 align:start position:0%
opportunity to review that change you
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
I will say states that are rolling
 
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.870 align:start position:0%
I will say states that are rolling
Conformity

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
Conformity
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
um typically have a broader tax base
 
00:27:48.529 --> 00:27:48.539 align:start position:0%
than New Hampshire does so there's a
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
sales tax and an income tax as well so
 
00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
there they could maybe take different
 
00:27:54.769 --> 00:27:54.779 align:start position:0%
their risk profile might be different
 
00:27:58.570 --> 00:27:58.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
representative roachford and then Mr
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
my question and I just want to make sure
 
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding this correctly so I
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
think sometimes we look at
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
our BPT revenues
 
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
and equate that to
 
00:28:21.649 --> 00:28:21.659 align:start position:0%
the temperature the the the health of
 
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
our businesses in the state of New
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but if I'm hearing you right
 
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
the BPT boost that we're seeing may be
 
00:28:30.649 --> 00:28:30.659 align:start position:0%
secondary to some changes that the
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
federal government has made so it's
 
00:28:36.409 --> 00:28:36.419 align:start position:0%
maybe not an accurate indicator of our
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
business climate in New Hampshire
 
00:28:42.649 --> 00:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
correct and so when we went through the
 
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
BPT slides at the last presentation you
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
may remember that the majority of our
 
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
business profits tax revenue comes from
 
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
very large multinational corporations
 
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
and so it is probably a more indicative
 
00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:00.860 align:start position:0%
barometer of their health
 
00:29:03.769 --> 00:29:03.779 align:start position:0%
and our smaller you know New Hampshire
 
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
only businesses pay a very small portion
 
00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
of our business profits tax so
 
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
the tax as a whole can kind of indicate
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
General Health of the economy but I
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
would caution about making any specific
 
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
assumptions about new hampshire-based
 
00:29:21.409 --> 00:29:21.419 align:start position:0%
businesses from the business profits tax
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
revenue because it is primarily coming
 
00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
from large multinational corporations
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
can I follow up
 
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah so thank you
 
00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:32.039 align:start position:0%
um So you you're saying it's a health of
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
the company but it may just be
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
indicative not necessarily the health of
 
00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
the company but the change in tax
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
structure in the way we're seeing some
 
00:29:42.649 --> 00:29:42.659 align:start position:0%
of those profits where we may not have
 
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:46.340 align:start position:0%
been seeing them fully prior to 2017
 
00:29:48.649 --> 00:29:48.659 align:start position:0%
accounting for them but now now we are
 
00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
correct okay correct thank you
 
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask a question then we'll
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
get to representative ulery um so when
 
00:30:00.289 --> 00:30:00.299 align:start position:0%
did most of the repatriation occur what
 
00:30:00.299 --> 00:30:01.310 align:start position:0%
did most of the repatriation occur what
year

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:30:03.289 --> 00:30:03.299 align:start position:0%
so for federal purposes that would have
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
occurred in 2017 the year 2017 and 2018
 
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
the year that the tax cut in jobs act
 
00:30:12.049 --> 00:30:12.059 align:start position:0%
went into effect and then for New
 
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire purposes we've seen that in
 
00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
18 and 9 18 and forward
 
00:30:24.649 --> 00:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
but again for New Hampshire purposes
 
00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:27.059 align:start position:0%
it's only when the dividend is actually
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
paid actually paid back
 
00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:33.059 align:start position:0%
so most I mean is it fair to say that
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
that effect is probably dropping off at
 
00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
this point that was kind of my point
 
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
maybe not dropping off but it's just
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
kind of in our base at this point
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
there's no one-time revenue or
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
significant change that we really need
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
to account for the impact of tcja just
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
kind of exists in our base Revenue today
 
00:30:54.529 --> 00:30:54.539 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense yes okay okay thank
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
you representative ulery and then rep
 
00:30:59.810 --> 00:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
represented all me
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you just to follow up on
 
00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:03.779 align:start position:0%
representing Platt's uh uh question
 
00:31:06.169 --> 00:31:06.179 align:start position:0%
regarding uh the rolling versus static
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
uh with the rolling is it fair to say
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
that under the adoption of a rolling
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
adoption of federal law we have uh sub
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
uh suborned New Hampshire's coordinate
 
00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
yes New Hampshire's tax code becomes so
 
00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:25.740 align:start position:0%
subordinate too
 
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
um subordinates entirely differently I'm
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
 
00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.470 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
uh

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:35.169 --> 00:31:35.179 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
replaces right right we surrendered our
 
00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:40.980 align:start position:0%
sovereignty regarding setting tax law
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
right with rolling Conformity you are
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
just going to conform to what the
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
federal government has decided
 
00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
um for the tax code for that year and so
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
having static Conformity you may you are
 
00:31:54.889 --> 00:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
allowed to you have the opportunity to
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
make decisions and conform to specific
 
00:31:59.630 --> 00:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
versions of the code decouple from
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
specific versions of the code if you so
 
00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.570 align:start position:0%
specific versions of the code if you so
choose

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
choose
 
00:32:06.409 --> 00:32:06.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative Olney
 
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to point out that
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
yes the
 
00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
have been getting more money and that
 
00:32:27.649 --> 00:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
will continue but we may not see it
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
because from now on we're based on the
 
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
sales within New Hampshire
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
and we have no idea what that's going to
 
00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
do to us yet
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
correct so how that is representative
 
00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:43.799 align:start position:0%
always referring to the change in how we
 
00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:48.059 align:start position:0%
apportion or how we split out the pie of
 
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
a um
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
of a business that operates in multiple
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
States and so we typically we
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
historically have looked at the payroll
 
00:33:00.289 --> 00:33:00.299 align:start position:0%
the sales and the property of a business
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
to determine how much how large the
 
00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
piece of the pie is in New Hampshire and
 
00:33:06.049 --> 00:33:06.059 align:start position:0%
going forward we'll only be looking at
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
the sales of that business compared to
 
00:33:09.889 --> 00:33:09.899 align:start position:0%
their sales everywhere else to determine
 
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
could I just have a follow-up follow-up
 
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
do it well this is actually going back
 
00:33:21.769 --> 00:33:21.779 align:start position:0%
to BPT but on
 
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
it there must be some data on imports
 
00:33:27.889 --> 00:33:27.899 align:start position:0%
and exports from the state
 
00:33:29.389 --> 00:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:33:29.399 --> 00:33:31.370 align:start position:0%
is there
so

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:31.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:33.169 --> 00:33:33.179 align:start position:0%
we will have
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
a better idea of the impact of moving to
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
single sales Factor once we've started
 
00:33:45.169 --> 00:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
started to receive and
 
00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:48.419 align:start position:0%
have or have a significant number or a
 
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
representative number of returns with
 
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
because then we will have the new
 
00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
sourcing method for services and
 
00:33:59.090 --> 00:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
intangibles and we can extrapolate from
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
that what it would look like with just
 
00:34:03.649 --> 00:34:03.659 align:start position:0%
sales so so we are close
 
00:34:06.769 --> 00:34:06.779 align:start position:0%
um but we don't necessarily have it just
 
00:34:06.779 --> 00:34:08.210 align:start position:0%
um but we don't necessarily have it just
yet

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:08.220 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.290 align:start position:0%
yet
um

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.669 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
if looking at import or export data we
 
00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:15.419 align:start position:0%
would need to look at obviously both
 
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
goods and services
 
00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:18.409 align:start position:0%
goods and services
um

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:18.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:22.849 --> 00:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
and we'd need to know the first Services
 
00:34:22.859 --> 00:34:24.649 align:start position:0%
and we'd need to know the first Services
how

00:34:24.649 --> 00:34:24.659 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
the apportionment Works under
 
00:34:29.089 --> 00:34:29.099 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing so
 
00:34:31.849 --> 00:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
it's it's coming together
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
um but we don't have all the data just
 
00:34:33.359 --> 00:34:34.430 align:start position:0%
um but we don't have all the data just
yet

00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
are we going to have that before the
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
budget is finished
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
no I didn't think so
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
representative Ellery
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um you mentioned
 
00:34:50.089 --> 00:34:50.099 align:start position:0%
Services I uh following a couple of
 
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
journals a couple of
 
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
beige not quite quite shoe law firms in
 
00:34:59.089 --> 00:34:59.099 align:start position:0%
uh Manchester now have offices in London
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
and Paris and I think one of them has
 
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
one in Berlin too but uh I'm not sure
 
00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:07.580 align:start position:0%
that's the service they're offering
 
00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:15.609 --> 00:35:15.619 align:start position:0%
so under cost of performance
 
00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
we would look to where those Services
 
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
were provided so if the lawyer was
 
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
sitting here in New Hampshire and doing
 
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
that work then that work would be a
 
00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:29.300 align:start position:0%
portion to New Hampshire
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
now we're looking at market-based
 
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
sourcing so we look at where the
 
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
customer is
 
00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
so difference being if you had an office
 
00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
in to use your example London in New
 
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:42.770 align:start position:0%
in to use your example London in New
Hampshire

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
under cost of performance we would only
 
00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.510 align:start position:0%
under cost of performance we would only
be

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
essentially taxing the services that
 
00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
were performed here in New Hampshire
 
00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
under market-based sourcing we're going
 
00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
to tax all of the services that are
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
performed for New Hampshire customers
 
00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
so if the New Hampshire if I'm the New
 
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire customer and the attorney in
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
London and the attorney in New Hampshire
 
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
do work for me
 
00:36:08.569 --> 00:36:08.579 align:start position:0%
then that is now going to get a portion
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire so rather whether
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
service is performed it's where the
 
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
service is essentially received where
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
the customer is
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
not to use yes I will use initials for a
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
company who happens to operate in the
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
United Kingdom and in New Hampshire
 
00:36:32.569 --> 00:36:32.579 align:start position:0%
How's that gonna if I don't know how you
 
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
separate that out how it's going to work
 
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
I I really don't not understand that uh
 
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
it's the responsibility of the business
 
00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:45.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
essentially this the tax the services
 
00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:50.220 align:start position:0%
the value of the services performed for
 
00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
that those customers in New Hampshire
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
um will be the services that will be
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
okay looks like we are ready to okay
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
okay moving on to slide 41 the CSC
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax and right now
 
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
it so the CST is a seven percent tax on
 
00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
two-way communication Services only and
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh this tax is paid by the customer so
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's essentially is a tax on the
 
00:37:28.849 --> 00:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
customer but it's collected uh by the
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
service providers all two-way
 
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
communication Services providers are
 
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for collecting and limiting
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
the tax from the consumer to and filing
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
the return
 
00:37:41.569 --> 00:37:41.579 align:start position:0%
the return is filed on a monthly basis
 
00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
and is filed on the 15th day of the
 
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
following month
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
um and the uh if a liability under 100
 
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
per month returns a file quarterly and
 
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
are due by the 15th day of the month
 
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
following the quarter and once again
 
00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
there's estimates to be paid estimates
 
00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
are required if the tax liability is
 
00:37:59.690 --> 00:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
over 10 000 a month
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
um and then it's paid collected it's
 
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
collected by the 15th day of the month
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
on slide 42 uh here you'll see the CST
 
00:38:14.089 --> 00:38:14.099 align:start position:0%
revenue for a 10-year Trend
 
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
um it is has been steadily declining
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
since uh fiscal year 14 and then in
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 you do see a a sharper
 
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
decline to fiscal year 22 and the
 
00:38:29.329 --> 00:38:29.339 align:start position:0%
potential reasons that we're seeing for
 
00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:31.980 align:start position:0%
this sharp decline is because of how
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
companies service providers are
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
allocating the the two-way
 
00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
Communications the services for that to
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh Voice versus for data as um for CST
 
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue the
 
00:38:49.609 --> 00:38:49.619 align:start position:0%
services for data is not subject to for
 
00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
internet data it's not subject to to the
 
00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:08.700 align:start position:0%
so the Medicaid enhancement tax you'll
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
see is a little bit unique it's
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
essentially collected by dra but it is
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
spent by DHHS
 
00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
so Medicaid enhancement tax is a 5.4
 
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:22.140 align:start position:0%
percent tax on net Patient Service
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
revenue of hospitals taxes paid by
 
00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
General hospitals that provide inpatient
 
00:39:28.849 --> 00:39:28.859 align:start position:0%
and outpatient services but not
 
00:39:31.849 --> 00:39:31.859 align:start position:0%
including government facilities
 
00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
the tax period for met is a 12-month
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
period that begins on July 1 and ends on
 
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
June 30 so it follows the state fiscal
 
00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:39.950 align:start position:0%
June 30 so it follows the state fiscal
year

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
but the taxes due is based on the
 
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
hospital's fiscal year that ends Within
 
00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
that taxable period
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
so it is
 
00:39:53.089 --> 00:39:53.099 align:start position:0%
uh not as straightforward as a regular
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
business tax return where you just
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
operate under a normal for most
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
businesses calendar year
 
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
the hospitals must file a non-binding
 
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
estimate on or before January 15th of
 
00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
their estimated tax payment and then
 
00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
they're required to make the payment and
 
00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:10.740 align:start position:0%
file their return no later than April
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
15th in the same year
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
for this year for the taxable period
 
00:40:16.079 --> 00:40:16.910 align:start position:0%
for this year for the taxable period
that's

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:17.510 align:start position:0%
that's
um

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
is going to end June 30th 2023 the
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
non-binding estimates for the Medicaid
 
00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:24.740 align:start position:0%
enhancement tax were
 
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
302.1 million and that is up from the
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
prior taxable period actual amounts paid
 
00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh we have a couple questions uh
 
00:40:43.849 --> 00:40:43.859 align:start position:0%
representative ulery
 
00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:46.140 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.450 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
um

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
we're talking about Medicaid therefore
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about federal dollars
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
being sent back to the state which the
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
state is essentially skimming off uh I'm
 
00:40:59.930 --> 00:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
using that phrase deliberately uh some
 
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:01.740 align:start position:0%
of the monies that would be otherwise be
 
00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
going directly into patient services to
 
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
give it to other patient services
 
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
someplace else
 
00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:12.890 align:start position:0%
someplace else
foreign

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
who oversees where that other money is
 
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
going I mean you collect it but does
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
anyone oversee it or is that strictly up
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
to DHA s or and does not that skimming
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
increase the cost billing made by the
 
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
hospital or provider
 
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
to the federal government through the
 
00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.250 align:start position:0%
to the federal government through the
state

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:38.750 align:start position:0%
state
I

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
to the federal government
 
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
so the base the cost basis goes up which
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
means they get more money
 
00:41:50.089 --> 00:41:50.099 align:start position:0%
which means
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
everybody else has to pay more I'm
 
00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:55.140 align:start position:0%
trying to figure that one out if you can
 
00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
if that's a whole food I'll answer your
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
first question the same way for both
 
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
questions Department of Health and Human
 
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
Services can better explain to you
 
00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:08.450 align:start position:0%
Services can better explain to you
um

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:11.780 align:start position:0%
how the Medicaid enhancement tax revenue
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
is matched federally and how it is spent
 
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
via disproportionate share
 
00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:19.210 align:start position:0%
via disproportionate share
um

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:19.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
disproportionate share payments so we're
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
basically collecting the Medicaid
 
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
enhancement tax and essentially turning
 
00:42:29.089 --> 00:42:29.099 align:start position:0%
it over in whole to DHHS in order for
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
them to spend
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
um through the dish program
 
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:38.569 --> 00:42:38.579 align:start position:0%
representative almie
 
00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
thank you I believe that most most of
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
the disproportionate share goes to the
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
County nursing homes
 
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't it so disproportionate share is
 
00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
um going to go to
 
00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:57.410 align:start position:0%
um going to go to
um

00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to go to the hospitals that
 
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
pay the Met
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about the nursing
 
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:04.380 align:start position:0%
facility quality assessment right that's
 
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
separate yeah yeah this one is is our
 
00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
own hospitals correct so the hospitals
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
that pay into met will be the ones that
 
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
will receive the disproportionate share
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
payments they do not necessarily receive
 
00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
the same amount in Dish as they paid in
 
00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:22.609 align:start position:0%
the same amount in Dish as they paid in
met

00:43:22.609 --> 00:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
met
 
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
that changed a number of years ago so
 
00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
they received based on the formula in
 
00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:31.079 align:start position:0%
statute a portion of the Met
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
based on the calculation and statute but
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
it is not and no longer a one for one
 
00:43:38.809 --> 00:43:38.819 align:start position:0%
met to Dish calculation
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you and that is required
 
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
by the FED correct because
 
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
on we set up this scheme 20 something
 
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
years ago on I think it was Meryl wasn't
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
it or
 
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
and on it was essentially to get free
 
00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
money out of the feds to use as we as we
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
wished and we were using it in the
 
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
hospital systems but
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
we were just getting it getting their
 
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
share from them and giving it back to
 
00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
them in the same day
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
and we weren't supposed to talk about
 
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
on that I was I was part of the group
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
that had to create this contract with
 
00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
hospitals which took a lot of doing
 
00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:36.890 align:start position:0%
hospitals which took a lot of doing
um

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:39.060 align:start position:0%
but I think we haven't changed it much
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
since that time have we correct I the
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
the majority of the changes were made
 
00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:45.660 align:start position:0%
starting in the 2014 time frame
 
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
um and so we've been operating under the
 
00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement with the hospitals
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
and the statutory construction since
 
00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:55.700 align:start position:0%
that time but my main question was on
 
00:44:58.609 --> 00:44:58.619 align:start position:0%
how different has the non-binding
 
00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
estimate been from the final from the
 
00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:04.740 align:start position:0%
final over the years they're usually
 
00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
very accurate
 
00:45:08.329 --> 00:45:08.339 align:start position:0%
um because of the the delay essentially
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
between the end of the hospitals
 
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
um fiscal year and the Met taxable
 
00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
period that it applies to hospitals
 
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
generally know the amount of method
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's going to be due so their
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
page 44 we just again show a historical
 
00:45:29.809 --> 00:45:29.819 align:start position:0%
trend of met you can see it's you know
 
00:45:31.849 --> 00:45:31.859 align:start position:0%
increasing pretty consistently year over
 
00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
year you'll see that dip in fiscal year
 
00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
21. that's an impact of covid and the
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
fact that a lot of elective procedures
 
00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
non-emergency hospitalizations
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
Etc did not occur during that time so
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
that decreased the the base for the Met
 
00:45:50.329 --> 00:45:50.339 align:start position:0%
um but you can see it you know continued
 
00:45:55.849 --> 00:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
as I've already kind of mentioned dra's
 
00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
role in the administration of met so
 
00:46:02.089 --> 00:46:02.099 align:start position:0%
they file the non-binding estimate with
 
00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:04.980 align:start position:0%
us on January 15th we notify HHS of that
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
amount then the returns and the payments
 
00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:10.140 align:start position:0%
are received on the by the 15th of April
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
and we deposit that money into the
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care and Medicaid fund
 
00:46:17.569 --> 00:46:17.579 align:start position:0%
that's established under RSA 167 colon
 
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
64. and the commissioner of HHS is
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
responsible for expending those funds we
 
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
have the authority to audit and collect
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
any outstanding met Revenue so we have
 
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
the audit and a collection ability and
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
on slide 46 this is the nursing facility
 
00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
quality assessment it operates very
 
00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:44.900 align:start position:0%
similarly to the Met it's just a tax on
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
net patient revenues of nursing
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
facilities five and a half percent tax
 
00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:52.619 align:start position:0%
the assessments paid by the nursing
 
00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:55.140 align:start position:0%
facility as well as facilities licensed
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
as a specialty hospital and certified to
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
receive federal reimbursement as a
 
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
nursing facility
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
this rather than the Met having a
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
year-long taxable period the assessment
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
period for nfqa is split into quarters
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
and so each facility files are returned
 
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
by the 10th of the month following the
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
expiration of the quarter and they pay
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
and file their return at the same time
 
00:47:23.089 --> 00:47:23.099 align:start position:0%
on slide 47 you can see again the
 
00:47:25.069 --> 00:47:25.079 align:start position:0%
10-year trend
 
00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
with respect to the nursing facility
 
00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
and on slide 48 again our role in in the
 
00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
administration of nfqa again we return
 
00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:41.099 align:start position:0%
the money we deposit the money directly
 
00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
into the nursing facility trust fund and
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of HHS is the one
 
00:47:56.809 --> 00:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
all right moving on to I'm sorry we have
 
00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
a question representative almond yes the
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
chart for on page 47 only goes only goes
 
00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.010 align:start position:0%
chart for on page 47 only goes only goes
through

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
um 2020.
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
and it was going up at that point but
 
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
we've got severe stabbing shortages now
 
00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.150 align:start position:0%
we've got severe stabbing shortages now
so

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
that's a good point we we'll get you
 
00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
we'll get you an updated chart
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if it wasn't updated or
 
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.130 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if it wasn't updated or
if

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
the labels are incorrect
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
um I would note though if you look at
 
00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:33.060 align:start position:0%
the amounts here we're fluctuating
 
00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:33.910 align:start position:0%
the amounts here we're fluctuating
between

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:48:37.849 --> 00:48:37.859 align:start position:0%
37.3 million and 40.6 so it looks like a
 
00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
lot of fluctuation but the scale I think
 
00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
is kind of what's causing that but we'll
 
00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure that we get you an
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:52.569 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:48:52.569 --> 00:48:52.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
so the next text item is utility
 
00:48:57.849 --> 00:48:57.859 align:start position:0%
property tax upt
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
rs83-ft this text represents point zero
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
one percent of the 2.9 billion that's
 
00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
administered by the dra the tax rate is
 
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
uh 6.60 cents per one thousand dollars
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
of value of utility property and the
 
00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
taxes on the value of the UT property
 
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
and so that's determined by the dra on
 
00:49:20.809 --> 00:49:20.819 align:start position:0%
December 1st uh of the each of each year
 
00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
so this tax is paid on so on or before
 
00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
May 1st each year the company Michelle
 
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
file the form detailing the company's
 
00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
actual Financial operating performance
 
00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
since April 1 of the prior year and then
 
00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
the final payment is due on or before
 
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
January 15th and this as with other
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
taxes the estimates are required
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
and sorry I'm going to interject for
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
just one second one thing I want to just
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
point about upt is it is a property tax
 
00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
so you will see the reference to April
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
1st so we are looking for the value of
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
the property as of April 1st it's a
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
point in time that's different than the
 
00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
other taxes that we've talked about
 
00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:05.220 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about a taxable
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
period we're talking about the activity
 
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
of a business over 12 months
 
00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
so just noting property taxes tend to
 
00:50:14.089 --> 00:50:14.099 align:start position:0%
look at just a singular point in time so
 
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
that's why you'll see the reference to
 
00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
April 1st we're looking for the value as
 
00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
of April 1st
 
00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
representative ulery
 
00:50:24.589 --> 00:50:24.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for my question Mr King
 
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
um looking at your chart it looks like a
 
00:50:29.329 --> 00:50:29.339 align:start position:0%
Sawtooth pattern is beginning to develop
 
00:50:29.339 --> 00:50:31.670 align:start position:0%
Sawtooth pattern is beginning to develop
and

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
it looks like it starts right about the
 
00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:37.700 align:start position:0%
time we changed uh the assessment Pro
 
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:40.140 align:start position:0%
representative of brahmi and this
 
00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
committee put together a bill to change
 
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
the assessment of utilities properties
 
00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:46.910 align:start position:0%
the assessment of utilities properties
uh

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
at about the time this pattern starts to
 
00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:50.870 align:start position:0%
at about the time this pattern starts to
develop

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
develop
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
the first question is is this a Sawtooth
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
pattern going to continue up and down
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
across the the Baseline of the plan of
 
00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.370 align:start position:0%
across the the Baseline of the plan of
40.

00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:01.380 align:start position:0%
40.
 
00:51:04.089 --> 00:51:04.099 align:start position:0%
um in your estimate
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
guesstimate I guess right I'm sorry
 
00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
that's the first question go ahead all
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
right from from our understanding of
 
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
this sort of pattern is because of uh
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
credits that's being available for the
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
uh for the utility property companies
 
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
when they have credits on account so
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
they won't be paying that much in terms
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
of uh the taxes because they're using
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
update credit so therefore in the Years
 
00:51:29.329 --> 00:51:29.339 align:start position:0%
where they have credits that the revenue
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
will be down and then the next year and
 
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
make the estimate payments that that
 
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
Revenue would go up so that's the the uh
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
the indicate indication of that that's
 
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
the sign of that saw tooth yeah
 
00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:46.260 align:start position:0%
thank you and oh one follow-up follow-up
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
um the effect of this Taxation and just
 
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
for the record and for several members
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
who know the effect of this taxation on
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
the consumer rate because the consumers
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
are the ones that ultimately are paying
 
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:00.770 align:start position:0%
are the ones that ultimately are paying
this

00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
is what we have that information are you
 
00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
in coordination with the puc on that
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
because all the utilities I believe are
 
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
regulated there's no
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
except for
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
in-house private utility companies
 
00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
I'm not correct
 
00:52:20.569 --> 00:52:20.579 align:start position:0%
we don't have specific information about
 
00:52:23.329 --> 00:52:23.339 align:start position:0%
how much the utility property tax versus
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
a local property tax versus other taxes
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
that the entity or the utilities might
 
00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
pay directly impact
 
00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:33.660 align:start position:0%
um the consumer rates you're correct
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
that they do it's an expense of the
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
business and so to the extent that
 
00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
they're regulated it would be passed on
 
00:52:40.849 --> 00:52:40.859 align:start position:0%
to the consumer but we don't have a
 
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
breakdown for what upt like I said
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
versus the local property tax Etc would
 
00:52:46.319 --> 00:52:50.990 align:start position:0%
versus the local property tax Etc would
have

00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:54.530 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next text type is
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
railroad tags uh page 51 uh as Lindsay
 
00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579 align:start position:0%
mentioned for the other for upt railroad
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
tax is also a property type tax
 
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
um and it's taxed on every railroad
 
00:53:10.609 --> 00:53:10.619 align:start position:0%
Railway Express and every policy being
 
00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
all Dining Car Company
 
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
and the tax is on the market value of
 
00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
the properties fall through and full and
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
True Value as of April one and there you
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
see again the the reference to April one
 
00:53:26.809 --> 00:53:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:26.819 --> 00:53:27.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
so the railroad property applies to both
 
00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559 align:start position:0%
railroad companies and private rail cars
 
00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
operated for profits on on any Railroad
 
00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:37.140 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so it's only on the
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
rails that is in New Hampshire and not
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
and went for oh no before it May 1st of
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
each year the company shall file a form
 
00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
detailing the company's actual Financial
 
00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
operating performance and uh so similar
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
to the upt as well you follow financial
 
00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
performance and then pay the taxes after
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
that so payment is due within 30 days
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
from the date of notice of value of tax
 
00:54:03.839 --> 00:54:05.150 align:start position:0%
from the date of notice of value of tax
bill

00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:54:11.089 --> 00:54:11.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ames thank you
 
00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:15.710 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ames thank you
um

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
this question relates back to the
 
00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:20.220 align:start position:0%
utility property tax as well and it's uh
 
00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
in both cases Ray wrote on utilities
 
00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
dras I understand it determines the
 
00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
value of the property
 
00:54:29.809 --> 00:54:29.819 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
so I my question is over time how is
 
00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
that value
 
00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
changed in terms of increased value or
 
00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
is it stayed flat you're getting a 6.60
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
rate on the value so one would it sounds
 
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
like the value has stayed flat I don't
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
know why it would
 
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
um is there litigation
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
that's all related to uh on on your
 
00:54:59.329 --> 00:54:59.339 align:start position:0%
determination of value brought by the
 
00:54:59.339 --> 00:55:01.010 align:start position:0%
determination of value brought by the
utilities

00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
sure so yes the dra determines the value
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
of the properties for both the utility
 
00:55:09.849 --> 00:55:09.859 align:start position:0%
property tax and the railroad tax
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
the property taxpayers have the ability
 
00:55:16.609 --> 00:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
to appeal that value and some do each
 
00:55:20.329 --> 00:55:20.339 align:start position:0%
year and that process goes through a
 
00:55:23.329 --> 00:55:23.339 align:start position:0%
hearing uh well first there's potential
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
negotiation for settlement than if the
 
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
department and the taxpayer cannot reach
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
an agreement then that would go to
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
hearing at the dra and then could go on
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
to the board of tax and land appeals
 
00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
Superior Court and supreme court if
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
necessary we haven't had any appeals go
 
00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
the value that we set for the property
 
00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:50.700 align:start position:0%
is is four in the case of the utility
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
property tax for RSA 83f but a number of
 
00:55:57.890 --> 00:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
municipalities use that same value for
 
00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:00.180 align:start position:0%
the local property value within their
 
00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
municipality but not all some also value
 
00:56:06.829 --> 00:56:06.839 align:start position:0%
the property themselves through a
 
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
private independent assessor so it
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
depends on the municipality whether they
 
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
use r value or whether they determine
 
00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
their own local value if they determine
 
00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
their own local value then there could
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
be litigation associated with that but
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
that would be outside of the work that
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
we do
 
00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
representative ulrey
 
00:56:31.370 --> 00:56:31.380 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars for what
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
for operating a tourist attraction
 
00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.730 align:start position:0%
for operating a tourist attraction
um

00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
it's on the books and we administer it
 
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
okay on page 52.
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
the more property taxes so this is the
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax
 
00:56:59.450 --> 00:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
the taxes assessed and collected by the
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities to be retained for use by
 
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
their local school district the taxes
 
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
assessed to everyone owning real
 
00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
property in the state except those that
 
00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:11.220 align:start position:0%
pay the utility property tax or the
 
00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
railroad tax
 
00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
and the department sets the the rate at
 
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
a level sufficient to generate revenue
 
00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:21.180 align:start position:0%
of 363 million dollars I would note that
 
00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
that amount was reduced to 263 million
 
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 23 there was a one-year
 
00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:30.839 align:start position:0%
100 million dollar reduction the
 
00:57:33.130 --> 00:57:33.140 align:start position:0%
legislature decided to use surplus funds
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
to essentially bridge that Gap and the
 
00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
rate is set to the nearest half cent
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
necessary to generate the revenue
 
00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.430 align:start position:0%
necessary to generate the revenue
required

00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
property taxes are based on local
 
00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
assessed valuations and they're
 
00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
administered and collected by the
 
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
individual cities and towns
 
00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
most property taxes are collected based
 
00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:54.900 align:start position:0%
on the market value of the property at
 
00:57:56.690 --> 00:57:56.700 align:start position:0%
its highest and best use and there are
 
00:57:58.809 --> 00:57:58.819 align:start position:0%
various exemptions credits and deferrals
 
00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
including elderly and blind exemptions
 
00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:03.500 align:start position:0%
veterans tax credit
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
solar and wood Heating and Energy System
 
00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative Olney thank you I just
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
like your opinion
 
00:58:20.089 --> 00:58:20.099 align:start position:0%
um there's a a lawsuit
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
against the Statewide property tax
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
at this point and the last time that
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
there was one on
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
the legislature at least thought that it
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
was tied to the county tax and the
 
00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District tax on
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.569 --> 00:58:47.579 align:start position:0%
um they're all structured to be
 
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
evaluated across
 
00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:52.380 align:start position:0%
across multiple locally assist
 
00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:54.170 align:start position:0%
across multiple locally assist
valuations

00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
valuations
 
00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:55.609 align:start position:0%
valuations
uh

00:58:55.609 --> 00:58:55.619 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:56.930 --> 00:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
do you
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
see any possibility that from that
 
00:59:01.609 --> 00:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that it
 
00:59:06.049 --> 00:59:06.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:10.970 --> 00:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
I am not aware of any reason why it
 
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
would affect the County taxes so when we
 
00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
set tax rates at dra to your point we're
 
00:59:21.289 --> 00:59:21.299 align:start position:0%
looking at the total assessed value of
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
the municipality and then we're looking
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
at the amount that needs to be raised
 
00:59:26.809 --> 00:59:26.819 align:start position:0%
for swept we're looking at the amount
 
00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
that needs to be raised for the county
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the amount that needs
 
00:59:31.849 --> 00:59:31.859 align:start position:0%
to be raised for the municipality and
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
the local school district and we're
 
00:59:35.809 --> 00:59:35.819 align:start position:0%
using that value to determine all of
 
00:59:35.819 --> 00:59:36.730 align:start position:0%
using that value to determine all of
those

00:59:36.730 --> 00:59:36.740 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
but it's just a essentially a simple
 
00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
math exercise where we look at how much
 
00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
running needs to be raised for the
 
00:59:46.849 --> 00:59:46.859 align:start position:0%
county and we divide it by the total
 
00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
taxable property total assessed value
 
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
and that's how we figure out the rate so
 
00:59:54.049 --> 00:59:54.059 align:start position:0%
they are when you look at your tax bill
 
00:59:56.690 --> 00:59:56.700 align:start position:0%
you know if you're if the tax rate in
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
your town is 26 dollars per thousand
 
01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the total of all the
 
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
rates but they're essentially calculated
 
01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.390 align:start position:0%
rates but they're essentially calculated
individually

01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
individually
 
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
I believe that that well I know that
 
01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
that first lawsuit was based on the fact
 
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:14.700 align:start position:0%
that the state had totally forgotten
 
01:00:18.289 --> 01:00:18.299 align:start position:0%
about its constitutional uh obligation
 
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
to oversee the assessments every five
 
01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.670 align:start position:0%
to oversee the assessments every five
years

01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
so we do monitor the assessments we
 
01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
ensure that they are that every
 
01:00:29.569 --> 01:00:29.579 align:start position:0%
municipality does a full reevaluation
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
every five years some municipalities to
 
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
decide to do it more frequently we
 
01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:37.140 align:start position:0%
monitor to make sure that they are done
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
at least every five years and then we
 
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
monitor compliance to make sure that
 
01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:43.859 align:start position:0%
those revaluations and reassessments are
 
01:00:43.859 --> 01:00:44.930 align:start position:0%
those revaluations and reassessments are
done

01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:45.789 align:start position:0%
done
um

01:00:45.789 --> 01:00:45.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:45.799 --> 01:00:47.510 align:start position:0%
um
in

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:48.410 align:start position:0%
in
um

01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
in an acceptable way to the standards
 
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
that have provide that have been adopted
 
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
under law
 
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
so we didn't forget
 
01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:58.329 align:start position:0%
so we didn't forget
anymore

01:00:58.329 --> 01:00:58.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
well just to clarify and I know that you
 
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
know this because you're actively
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
involved in this litigation indirectly
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
by providing affidavits and such
 
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
the issue now in swept is unique to
 
01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:17.089 align:start position:0%
the issue now in swept is unique to
swept

01:01:17.089 --> 01:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
swept
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
because the issue is whether
 
01:01:25.089 --> 01:01:25.099 align:start position:0%
what is called excess swept Revenue
 
01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
can stay in the back within the town
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
that has collected that excess above
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
adequacy above the cost of adequacy
 
01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:37.740 align:start position:0%
that's that's the issue that's being
 
01:01:40.849 --> 01:01:40.859 align:start position:0%
hotly litigated as we speak halfway
 
01:01:43.609 --> 01:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
through the briefing process and in mid
 
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
bar early March I think a briefing will
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
be over and it'll be in the hands of the
 
01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
judge so it's an important issue and uh
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
is this I'm saying this just because
 
01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
this is an opportunity to report back on
 
01:01:58.250 --> 01:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
an issue that also relates to one of my
 
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
bills yes correct all right on to the
 
01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
excavation tab okay
 
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
slides 54 and 55 are the excavation tax
 
01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
and the timber tax also known as Sticks
 
01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:13.220 align:start position:0%
and Stones
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
these are taxes that are assessed by and
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
paid to the local assessing officials so
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
these this is Municipal Revenue but the
 
01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:26.220 align:start position:0%
dra is tasked with assisting the
 
01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
municipalities with administering these
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
taxes I won't go into detail about them
 
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
the rates are included here just know
 
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
that we help the municipalities ensure
 
01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
that the proper amount of tax is is
 
01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
collected and paid to the local
 
01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:46.430 align:start position:0%
collected and paid to the local
municipalities

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.950 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
so the next slide slide 55 this is the
 
01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
timing of the Dre revenues and just note
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
that this data is based on the average
 
01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
of fiscal year 22 20 to 22 of from the
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
Das Revenue Focus data
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
um so this will be a very helpful Tool
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh table uh when you're trying to
 
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
consider okay when is the um when are
 
01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:12.299 align:start position:0%
the times of the year that you'll see
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
the majority of the income coming in and
 
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
just using the business the first table
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
there on the left as an example you'll
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
see that the majority the higher the
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
higher months where the incomes are
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
coming in are in September December and
 
01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
then in March and April and then in June
 
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
and those are the years of when the
 
01:03:36.289 --> 01:03:36.299 align:start position:0%
estimates uh to be paid
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
um and then in March and April that's
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
also the the time of the months where
 
01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
the Partnerships returns are due as well
 
01:03:46.609 --> 01:03:46.619 align:start position:0%
as the corporate returns that you
 
01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
um and then you'll see moving on to MNR
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh usually it's kind it's more of a flat
 
01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:56.460 align:start position:0%
kind of a expectation in terms of when
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
revenues are coming in except for in
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
August and September
 
01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
and those are the higher months probably
 
01:04:04.609 --> 01:04:04.619 align:start position:0%
when those the times when activities for
 
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
m r are higher for the for the state
 
01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:13.140 align:start position:0%
and tobacco similarly there's also a
 
01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:14.510 align:start position:0%
and tobacco similarly there's also a
flat

01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
flat
 
01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:15.109 align:start position:0%
flat
um

01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
expectation for revenues on on a monthly
 
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.549 align:start position:0%
expectation for revenues on on a monthly
basis

01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
um because the tobacco tax is collected
 
01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis and similar with an
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
MNR as well it's all collected on a
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
monthly basis
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
and then for IND you'll also see the
 
01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:31.640 align:start position:0%
similar uh
 
01:04:34.849 --> 01:04:34.859 align:start position:0%
peaks in September uh in the the months
 
01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
of where the estimates are coming in uh
 
01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
September and then December and then in
 
01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.030 align:start position:0%
September and then December and then in
January

01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
January
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh and then in April
 
01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:46.980 align:start position:0%
as well as for red similarly it's all
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's more driven by activity
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that the activities for
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
red transactions likely um because it's
 
01:04:59.329 --> 01:04:59.339 align:start position:0%
on a uh the month after so it's uh
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
activities in July but then collected in
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
August and then activities in August
 
01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:09.770 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
all right and and then the the section
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
be below that is just a quarterly
 
01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
breakdown uh which is easier to follow
 
01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
in terms of when you want to see each uh
 
01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
the the money is coming in for each
 
01:05:31.609 --> 01:05:31.619 align:start position:0%
quarter and then the sections under that
 
01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:34.140 align:start position:0%
is on the bi-annual
 
01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
I would just notify Ken before your
 
01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:37.730 align:start position:0%
I would just notify Ken before your
question

01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:38.390 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
this is important when you're or we're
 
01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
working with you on doing Revenue
 
01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:47.180 align:start position:0%
estimates because we are going to
 
01:05:50.569 --> 01:05:50.579 align:start position:0%
estimate fiscal year 23 first to come up
 
01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
with a base and then we're going to
 
01:05:55.609 --> 01:05:55.619 align:start position:0%
estimate growth rates for 24 and 25.
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to use when we do this we're
 
01:05:59.630 --> 01:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
going to use data through January so
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
just over half of the year
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
I would point out IND in particular when
 
01:06:07.370 --> 01:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
you look at the data for the first half
 
01:06:09.650 --> 01:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
of the year of IND you've received just
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
under 30 of the total revenue for the
 
01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
year you still have almost 70 percent of
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
the revenue still to come in
 
01:06:20.329 --> 01:06:20.339 align:start position:0%
so this can be helpful when we're
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
talking about Revenue estimating looking
 
01:06:24.770 --> 01:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
at the amount of Revenue we've seen year
 
01:06:26.569 --> 01:06:26.579 align:start position:0%
to date if we were to see something
 
01:06:29.809 --> 01:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
extreme with IND I would caution and
 
01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
tell you well we haven't seen most of
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
the revenue yet most of that revenue is
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
still to come so this is really just to
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
inform you about how we're going to
 
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
estimate fiscal 23.
 
01:06:42.829 --> 01:06:42.839 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Schamberg
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh just a question
 
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
on the business percentage of money in
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
the quarterly the tobacco percentage of
 
01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
money and the rent percentage of money
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
is there any particular reason why those
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
come out to 101 versus the others that
 
01:07:00.289 --> 01:07:00.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.299 --> 01:07:01.730 align:start position:0%
 
rounding

01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
rounding
 
01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
rounding you're pretty quick with your
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
math what's that that was quick math yes
 
01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
it was just checking all right thank you
 
01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:35.329 --> 01:07:35.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm not sure that that on this
 
01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
year is going to be any less atypical so
 
01:07:43.789 --> 01:07:43.799 align:start position:0%
no but you bring up you bring up a good
 
01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
point especially for business taxes
 
01:07:48.529 --> 01:07:48.539 align:start position:0%
where during covid there were some
 
01:07:51.049 --> 01:07:51.059 align:start position:0%
extended due dates that caused at the
 
01:07:52.730 --> 01:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
federal level that caused us to receive
 
01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:54.230 align:start position:0%
federal level that caused us to receive
money

01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
um a little bit out of whack and that
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
would be included in that fiscal 20 to
 
01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
22 so we should probably look at a
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
longer time frame
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:08.700 align:start position:0%
and the next slide slide 56 uh the
 
01:08:11.329 --> 01:08:11.339 align:start position:0%
resources for where we uh compiled the
 
01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:13.980 align:start position:0%
data to provide to
 
01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
to prepare this presentation
 
01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
um the annual report essentially is a
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
very good Tool uh we we published the
 
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
annual report annually it's available on
 
01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:25.490 align:start position:0%
annual report annually it's available on
yes

01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
right it's available on our website uh
 
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
for download
 
01:08:33.169 --> 01:08:33.179 align:start position:0%
um and it has a lot of data in terms of
 
01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
History especially especially if any of
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
the members here would want to know more
 
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
about the history of each tax type it is
 
01:08:43.729 --> 01:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
there on in the annual report
 
01:08:46.450 --> 01:08:46.460 align:start position:0%
um and then the transparency page are
 
01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
documents that's available on our
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
website on the top right hand corner
 
01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
there's a transparency link and you
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
click on that you have it bring you to
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
the pie chart in terms of the the total
 
01:08:58.430 --> 01:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh the breakdown of all the revenue
 
01:09:00.829 --> 01:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
types that's administered and then
 
01:09:02.269 --> 01:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
further down that's you can drill down
 
01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
further uh into the uh different text
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
types and the data that's available
 
01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:07.729 align:start position:0%
types and the data that's available
there

01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:07.739 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
and then we also use data from the daily
 
01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
revenue updates tax expenditure report
 
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.809 --> 01:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
is the I'm assuming the annual report
 
01:09:20.819 --> 01:09:21.470 align:start position:0%
is the I'm assuming the annual report
um

01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
we can get either is it historical we
 
01:09:27.769 --> 01:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
goes back certain number of years okay
 
01:09:27.779 --> 01:09:30.169 align:start position:0%
goes back certain number of years okay
great

01:09:30.169 --> 01:09:30.179 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:09:30.179 --> 01:09:31.070 align:start position:0%
great
yeah

01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:09:32.809 --> 01:09:32.819 align:start position:0%
any questions so okay representative
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
if we want to be added to the
 
01:09:42.829 --> 01:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
distribution list we should let you know
 
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
I hope you're sending it to all of us
 
01:09:49.249 --> 01:09:49.259 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative Ames now you're going to
 
01:09:56.209 --> 01:09:56.219 align:start position:0%
get it through yeah uh the reference to
 
01:09:58.490 --> 01:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
the tax expenditure report reminds me of
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
the legislative committee to review his
 
01:10:03.229 --> 01:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
tax expenditures I don't remember the
 
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
exact name but as tax expenditures in it
 
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
which I think is a continuing committee
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
um we needed to get it going again I
 
01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
think that's just an opportunity to flag
 
01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:17.060 align:start position:0%
this that uh that need to be
 
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
appointments made to that committee it's
 
01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:20.510 align:start position:0%
appointments made to that committee it's
a

01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know it changes every two years
 
01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
because legislators change but um I was
 
01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
on it last year and so were several
 
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
people others from this committee who
 
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
makes who makes the appointments uh the
 
01:10:35.689 --> 01:10:35.699 align:start position:0%
governor uh no no uh probably the
 
01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
speaker and the Senate President
 
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative almond uh I'm calling
 
01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
representative Ami yeah and I
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
about a month ago sent an email to uh oh
 
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
what's her name in the speaker's office
 
01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.310 align:start position:0%
what's her name in the speaker's office
um

01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
and I said I wanted to be on the
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund committee again and I
 
01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
explained to her who had been on the
 
01:11:11.410 --> 01:11:11.420 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund committee and on
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
she took that and ran with it so it
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
needs some initiative From Below because
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
they have all of these committees they
 
01:11:22.729 --> 01:11:22.739 align:start position:0%
have to appoint people to so if we want
 
01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:25.739 align:start position:0%
something in in my case we just needed
 
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
people to be in place by June
 
01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:32.209 align:start position:0%
people to be in place by June
uh

01:11:32.209 --> 01:11:32.219 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:32.219 --> 01:11:33.290 align:start position:0%
uh
but

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
but that's the same for yours because
 
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I wrote both of them
 
01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
so I think that would be a good one for
 
01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
a chair or moisture to uh
 
01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
push forward it's important review
 
01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
process sort of ensures we're looking at
 
01:11:53.930 --> 01:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
what we call tax expenditures which are
 
01:11:59.810 --> 01:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
credits that uh that are a way of
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
what moving money or keeping money in a
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
place where
 
01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
policy says it will do good we want to
 
01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
make sure that that's happening that way
 
01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
okay thank you excuse me Brett was that
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Maybe
 
01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:16.820 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:29.050 align:start position:0%
all right
um

01:12:29.050 --> 01:12:29.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay we can continue
 
01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
okay so slide 57 we're going to give you
 
01:12:37.370 --> 01:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
a little preview about what we're gonna
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
do when we're back here on Thursday so
 
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
hopefully the goal is you have at least
 
01:12:46.610 --> 01:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
a very high level understanding of the
 
01:12:49.729 --> 01:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
various tax types so that we can help
 
01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
you start the revenue estimating process
 
01:12:55.729 --> 01:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned a couple times we start
 
01:12:58.850 --> 01:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
with trying to estimate where fiscal
 
01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:02.460 align:start position:0%
year 23 is going to end up and we do
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
that by running a few very few scenarios
 
01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
first we say what if Revenue was just
 
01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
equal to plan
 
01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
then we say what if we took actual
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue through January and that we were
 
01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
equal to plan for the rest of the year
 
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
third scenario what if we took actual
 
01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
Revenue through January and revenue for
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
the remaining months of the year equaled
 
01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
prior year
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
then the last two scenarios we run
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
we say what if Revenue through January
 
01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:38.460 align:start position:0%
and then our percent difference from
 
01:13:41.209 --> 01:13:41.219 align:start position:0%
plan year to date remained for the rest
 
01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
of the year so we're five percent above
 
01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
plan year to date let's assume we remain
 
01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
five percent above plan for the rest of
 
01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
the year and then that same percentage
 
01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
change versus prior year so if we are 10
 
01:13:54.649 --> 01:13:54.659 align:start position:0%
ahead of Prior year year to date let's
 
01:13:57.410 --> 01:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
assume we stay 10 ahead of Prior year
 
01:13:59.689 --> 01:13:59.699 align:start position:0%
for the rest of the year so we're going
 
01:14:02.330 --> 01:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
to run these five scenarios and we're
 
01:14:04.610 --> 01:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
going to look at them based on the
 
01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
knowledge that we have and kind of say
 
01:14:09.290 --> 01:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
yeah you know what we've been 20 ahead
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
of plan all year there's no way that
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
revenue is actually going to be equal to
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
plan we'll throw that one out so we'll
 
01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
come back to you with what we think are
 
01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
the two most likely scenarios of what
 
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to see
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 23
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
then we're going to give you a range of
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
growth rates for 24 and 25 so you're
 
01:14:30.890 --> 01:14:30.900 align:start position:0%
going to take fiscal 23 revenue and then
 
01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
you're going to grow it for 24 and
 
01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
you're going to grow it again for 25.
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
it may be negative growth depending on
 
01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
the tax type we're talking about but
 
01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
I'll use the term growth
 
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
when we are doing the scenarios for
 
01:14:48.770 --> 01:14:48.780 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23 and then the growth rates for
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 will also work with you to
 
01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:54.260 align:start position:0%
keep to take into account
 
01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
changes to existing tax law so for
 
01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
instance the I and D phase out we have
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
estimates of what that Revenue impact
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
will be and we'll work those into the
 
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates so let's say we're
 
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
going to grow we'll use an extreme
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
example let's say we're going to grow I
 
01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
and D by 50 but we know that the impact
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
of the rate reduction as IND starts to
 
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
phase out is 20 million we'll grow it by
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
50 and then we'll take the 20 million
 
01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:23.390 align:start position:0%
50 and then we'll take the 20 million
out

01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:15:25.850 --> 01:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
what we won't worry about and this is
 
01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:27.900 align:start position:0%
Chris in the lba's job where we're not
 
01:15:30.530 --> 01:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
going to worry about is any changes to
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that this committee or any
 
01:15:34.370 --> 01:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
other committees or the Senate is
 
01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
currently considering those changes will
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
happen in the Surplus statement and the
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
LBA will put that together so we don't
 
01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
need to worry about any of the bills
 
01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
you've heard so far all of that will
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
happen in the Surplus statement we'll
 
01:15:51.229 --> 01:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
just worry about current law as it
 
01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:53.460 align:start position:0%
exists today
 
01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
representative plett has a question
 
01:15:57.169 --> 01:15:57.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:15:59.040 --> 01:15:59.870 align:start position:0%
the question
um

01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:02.570 --> 01:16:02.580 align:start position:0%
do you rank order
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
which will present in terms of least
 
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue impact or most Revenue impact
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh tax by tax
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
we tend to just give you the what we
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
feel is the most reasonable range
 
01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
I understand that but having done that
 
01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
one tax is going to prove three million
 
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
one's going to produce 30 million one's
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
going to approach 50 million and so on
 
01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
can rank order them you want us to do
 
01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:29.330 align:start position:0%
can rank order them you want us to do
them

01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
highest I'm sorry I'm not understanding
 
01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:37.140 align:start position:0%
I um I'm asking again to this for the
 
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
least tax impact of volume for one tax
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
to bigger bigger bigger or the other way
 
01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
around right so so we we could perhaps
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
take the bottom layer of revenues and
 
01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:48.900 align:start position:0%
just accept and then go dig into I see
 
01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
01:16:52.490 --> 01:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
sure so
 
01:16:54.050 --> 01:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
um what we'll do when we come in on
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
Thursday is we'll kind of present all of
 
01:16:58.250 --> 01:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
the revenues to you so that you can
 
01:16:59.870 --> 01:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
understand what we're talking about and
 
01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
then with Chris you'll end the chair and
 
01:17:04.189 --> 01:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
vice chair I think you'll work on
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
determining what revenues you want to
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
tackle first and to your point there may
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
be some that you know the revenue
 
01:17:11.689 --> 01:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
estimate right away so you can just get
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
those out of the way and then save the
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
more difficult work for later so I think
 
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
there's flexibility in the order in
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
which you take the taxes
 
01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct we can take them up
 
01:17:25.149 --> 01:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
in whatever order we want and typically
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
we will start with the ones that aren't
 
01:17:31.490 --> 01:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
varying too much and um and make those
 
01:17:35.689 --> 01:17:35.699 align:start position:0%
those estimates and um and then and then
 
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
go to the more difficult ones as we get
 
01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
more information
 
01:17:41.209 --> 01:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
representative ulery
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
um Tennessee recently went through an
 
01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
IND reduction that I think that's the
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
most recent state
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
can we get something from them to show
 
01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
what happened there
 
01:17:55.729 --> 01:17:55.739 align:start position:0%
so we have
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
just a general idea I think their IND
 
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
was a a lot bigger hit than ours will be
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm just trying to to
 
01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
balance yeah we can we can look and see
 
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:09.300 align:start position:0%
if there's anything that we can glean
 
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
from that to your point their their IND
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
it was a larger tax base much larger
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
revenue and when um when we're looking
 
01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
at the fiscal impact of the IND repeal
 
01:18:23.149 --> 01:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
it's pretty formulaic just in terms of
 
01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
it was taxed at five percent we know
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
what the base is
 
01:18:29.209 --> 01:18:29.219 align:start position:0%
um and then we kind of just recalculate
 
01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
for each of the various rates but we'll
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
look and see if there's anything that we
 
01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
can kind of gleam from what happened in
 
01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
Tennessee follow up yes um yeah well
 
01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
there's two things one you said you know
 
01:18:42.649 --> 01:18:42.659 align:start position:0%
what the tax base is except it's changed
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
because of uh a couple of factors which
 
01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
we've already discussed but that's we
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
need to hear that uh we're not on topic
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
exactly uh in talking with some uh
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
representatives from Tennessee they were
 
01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:59.270 align:start position:0%
representatives from Tennessee they were
hesitant

01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
hesitant
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
very concerned about going forward with
 
01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
their ID and then pleasantly surprised
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh could you talk to your Cal our
 
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
colleagues and determine why they were
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
pleasantly surprised sure
 
01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh we'll see what we can find out yeah I
 
01:19:20.570 --> 01:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
would just be kind of interesting so it
 
01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
gives us a place to start uh somebody
 
01:19:26.689 --> 01:19:26.699 align:start position:0%
else has gone through this already and
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
let the volunteers figure it out sure
 
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions Revenue kind of
 
01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
estimating process and we'll be here
 
01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
along with Chris uh throughout all of it
 
01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
with you so
 
01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:41.450 align:start position:0%
with you so
okay

01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
slide 58 I just wanted to take a couple
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
of minutes
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
um to I guess both update and inform the
 
01:19:51.130 --> 01:19:51.140 align:start position:0%
committee I know there are some
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
Representatives who've been on the
 
01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:53.699 align:start position:0%
committee for a while but I know a
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
number of you are new so I just wanted
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
to kind of get everybody up to speed on
 
01:20:00.169 --> 01:20:00.179 align:start position:0%
what the dra refers to as our Revenue
 
01:20:04.729 --> 01:20:04.739 align:start position:0%
information management system or rims
 
01:20:07.729 --> 01:20:07.739 align:start position:0%
so the dra received a 30 million one
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
hundred and sixty thousand dollar
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
Capital appropriation to replace our
 
01:20:14.450 --> 01:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
aging tax information system known as
 
01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:15.709 align:start position:0%
aging tax information system known as
Tims

01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:15.719 align:start position:0%
Tims
 
01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
we do taxes we're not the most creative
 
01:20:19.850 --> 01:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
people so cut us a break on the the
 
01:20:22.729 --> 01:20:22.739 align:start position:0%
naming we replaced Tims with rims
 
01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
Tim's was implemented in 1990 it was
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
obsolete it was very limited in its
 
01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
functionality it was a cobalt-based
 
01:20:33.290 --> 01:20:33.300 align:start position:0%
system so black background you know
 
01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
Green flashing cursor no ability to use
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
a mouse everything was function keys
 
01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
um and what's wrong with that
 
01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
tried and true technology but
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
things have come a long way in the past
 
01:20:53.450 --> 01:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh 30 years punch machines
 
01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
so rims is used internally at dra and is
 
01:20:59.630 --> 01:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
also used by taxpayers and practitioners
 
01:21:02.570 --> 01:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
we implemented it in conjunction with
 
01:21:05.090 --> 01:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
doit and again it's a complete overall
 
01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
of our back end technology system and it
 
01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
really Consolidated many disparate
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
systems into one
 
01:21:14.689 --> 01:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
fast Enterprises was selected through an
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
RFP process to provide their commercial
 
01:21:19.729 --> 01:21:19.739 align:start position:0%
off-the-shelf or cots software known as
 
01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
gentax fast and gen tax operate in many
 
01:21:26.330 --> 01:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
many many states this is what they do
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
they do Tax Administration and they do
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
it well so we feel lucky to have
 
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
partnered with them the implementation
 
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
of rims was consisted of three phases
 
01:21:38.090 --> 01:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
each took about a year and the contract
 
01:21:39.850 --> 01:21:39.860 align:start position:0%
also includes support and maintenance
 
01:21:43.610 --> 01:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
the total cost for that contract was 29
 
01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
million five hundred and fifty thousand
 
01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:47.270 align:start position:0%
million five hundred and fifty thousand
dollars

01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
on slide 59 you can see the various
 
01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
rollouts we had three roll outs as I
 
01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
mentioned we started with the meals and
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
rentals tax Medicaid enhancement tax and
 
01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
nfqa we moved into our larger tax types
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
of business taxes interests and
 
01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
dividends and communication Services tax
 
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
and then in the third and final rollout
 
01:22:12.669 --> 01:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
we implemented tobacco ret upt Etc
 
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
I will note all of these rollouts were
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
on time and on budget you will see they
 
01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
go right through the covid-19 pandemic
 
01:22:26.209 --> 01:22:26.219 align:start position:0%
we pivoted at the time we worked from
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
home we did everything that was
 
01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
necessary and we remained on time in our
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
budget so I'm very proud of that work
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
our employees and our vendor worked very
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
hard and it really propelled the dra
 
01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:41.030 align:start position:0%
hard and it really propelled the dra
forward

01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:22:43.070 --> 01:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
we we have a question from
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
for the operation of this I was as you
 
01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
know part of this entire thing yeah
 
01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
um at least on the edge yeah the
 
01:23:05.149 --> 01:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
on the web yeah there you go I saw you
 
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
spot uh the question I'm asking is and
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
we asked this one back in 2017-2018.
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
this was intended to make dra more
 
01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
efficient it was intended to reduce some
 
01:23:21.649 --> 01:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
of the Manpower because you would
 
01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
replace that with machine power
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
it was also uh intended to be more
 
01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
consumer friendly
 
01:23:34.850 --> 01:23:34.860 align:start position:0%
uh I take from this presentation and
 
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
from your general attitude regarding
 
01:23:39.709 --> 01:23:39.719 align:start position:0%
this and the degree of the material we
 
01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
found some of those goals have been met
 
01:23:47.770 --> 01:23:47.780 align:start position:0%
have they been met was I I'm trying to
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
justify the expenditure of the 30
 
01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
million dollars to people that perhaps
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily want the government to
 
01:23:57.169 --> 01:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
spend money on government
 
01:23:57.179 --> 01:23:58.790 align:start position:0%
spend money on government
sure

01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
so I would say an overwhelming yes to to
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
all of your questions rims
 
01:24:07.130 --> 01:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
um delivered what we thought it could
 
01:24:09.370 --> 01:24:09.380 align:start position:0%
and should deliver
 
01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:15.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of efficiency we are able to
 
01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
process all of our returns deal with all
 
01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
taxpayer interactions requests for
 
01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
refunds Etc and in very timely manner we
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
did not see significant delays in the
 
01:24:34.130 --> 01:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
work that we produce as a result of the
 
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
hiring shortages that all businesses and
 
01:24:38.630 --> 01:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
government has felt over the past few
 
01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
years we have been operating at about 15
 
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
percent vacancy rate for close to a year
 
01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
and a half two years now and everything
 
01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
is still happening on time so people
 
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
should not be experiencing any delays as
 
01:24:53.930 --> 01:24:53.940 align:start position:0%
a result of the Staffing shortage and
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
that is due to the fact that rims is
 
01:24:57.250 --> 01:24:57.260 align:start position:0%
more efficient
 
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
we have a we've been able to
 
01:25:06.169 --> 01:25:06.179 align:start position:0%
reallocate resources to work that used
 
01:25:09.290 --> 01:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
to have long backlogs because rims is
 
01:25:11.570 --> 01:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
more efficient so
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
um you know for instance you know
 
01:25:15.709 --> 01:25:15.719 align:start position:0%
processing a maintenance request from a
 
01:25:19.010 --> 01:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
taxpayer we had to process returns into
 
01:25:20.689 --> 01:25:20.699 align:start position:0%
the system that was the first priority
 
01:25:21.890 --> 01:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
and then we could work on maintenance
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
for the taxpayer now the returns get
 
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
processed so much easier through the
 
01:25:26.810 --> 01:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
system that employees that used to do
 
01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
that can now work on taxpayer
 
01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
maintenance so we have seen kind of all
 
01:25:34.970 --> 01:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
of those benefits that we hope to see
 
01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
in internally at dra in terms of for the
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and practitioners on slide 60
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
this is just an example
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
um it's a copy of the front page of
 
01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
granite tax connect so Granite tax
 
01:25:49.130 --> 01:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
connect is our online web portal so it
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
allows taxpayers and practitioners to
 
01:25:55.370 --> 01:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
access their account to see the payment
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
that you made that the check was
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
actually cashed to look at your current
 
01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
account status none of that
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
functionality existed before rims if you
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
had a question about your account you
 
01:26:07.490 --> 01:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
would call into our call center and they
 
01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:08.820 align:start position:0%
would answer your question in a very
 
01:26:10.729 --> 01:26:10.739 align:start position:0%
polite and timely way but you couldn't
 
01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
do it at 12 o'clock at night you'd have
 
01:26:14.810 --> 01:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
to wait for our business hours you
 
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't do it on the weekend Etc so
 
01:26:19.729 --> 01:26:19.739 align:start position:0%
this is a picture of GTC
 
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
I will call out for you a few things
 
01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
that even without a granite tax connect
 
01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
account you can apply for a meals and
 
01:26:30.410 --> 01:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
rentals tax license you can make a
 
01:26:33.370 --> 01:26:33.380 align:start position:0%
payment we will take your money you can
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
request a payment plan you can upload a
 
01:26:39.229 --> 01:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
Power of Attorney form if you have a new
 
01:26:41.149 --> 01:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
power of attorney you can send that to
 
01:26:43.129 --> 01:26:43.139 align:start position:0%
us right through GTC without having to
 
01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:45.420 align:start position:0%
create an account so these are just a
 
01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
few things that you can do like I said
 
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
even without utilizing a full GTC
 
01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:52.070 align:start position:0%
even without utilizing a full GTC
account

01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
um another benefit if you are a taxpayer
 
01:26:56.990 --> 01:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
and you're using GTC and you're stuck
 
01:26:59.090 --> 01:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
you're trying to file a return let's say
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
and you're stuck you can't figure out
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
you know what button you're supposed to
 
01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
hit next or what information goes where
 
01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
if you call into our call center you can
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
provide them with a session ID number
 
01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:12.300 align:start position:0%
that shows on your screen and they can
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
watch what you're doing so they can
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
provide you real-time assistance so you
 
01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about spinning your
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
wheels and not being able to effectuate
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
what you need to in the system
 
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
um our call center is wonderful
 
01:27:27.770 --> 01:27:27.780 align:start position:0%
um we have five people dedicated
 
01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
full-time to our call center additional
 
01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
employees fill in as needed there's a
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
survey at the end of the call if
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
anyone's ever called in you get a survey
 
01:27:39.050 --> 01:27:39.060 align:start position:0%
you can rate US from one to five on our
 
01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
professionalism and one to five on our
 
01:27:45.169 --> 01:27:45.179 align:start position:0%
knowledge we routinely receive very high
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
marks you also have the ability to leave
 
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
a message and that's kind of my favorite
 
01:27:53.330 --> 01:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
part I get a summary of all the messages
 
01:27:55.850 --> 01:27:55.860 align:start position:0%
at the end of each week and people
 
01:27:57.770 --> 01:27:57.780 align:start position:0%
routinely praise us for just answering
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
the phone
 
01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
um apparently that's a novel idea these
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
days but just how helpful our employees
 
01:28:09.229 --> 01:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
are and a lot of that is because of rims
 
01:28:11.570 --> 01:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
and the ability for both taxpayers
 
01:28:13.610 --> 01:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
practitioners and the dra to be seeing
 
01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
the same data at the same time
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
there's one last piece of the rims
 
01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
benefit that I
 
01:28:21.290 --> 01:28:21.300 align:start position:0%
um I think you also might be interested
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
in which is on Slide 61.
 
01:28:28.490 --> 01:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
so part of the reason or part of the way
 
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
that the legislature funded rims was the
 
01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
30 million one hundred and sixty
 
01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar appropriation
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
but the interest the principle and
 
01:28:41.209 --> 01:28:41.219 align:start position:0%
interest on those bonds six million is
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
paid for by the general fund but the
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
remaining 24 million one hundred and
 
01:28:47.209 --> 01:28:47.219 align:start position:0%
sixty thousand dollars of principle and
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
interest is actually funded by Revenue
 
01:28:52.129 --> 01:28:52.139 align:start position:0%
uplift that's resulted from the system
 
01:28:54.649 --> 01:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
so we anticipated that there would be a
 
01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
benefit to the system
 
01:29:00.649 --> 01:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
um and so we have
 
01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
um under statute are required to
 
01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
transfer money into a dedicated fund to
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
pay the principal and interest and we're
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
going to do that until the fund reaches
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
40 million dollars which is what we
 
01:29:12.110 --> 01:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
anticipate the total principal and
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
interest to be on that 24 million one
 
01:29:17.209 --> 01:29:17.219 align:start position:0%
hundred and sixty thousand dollars and
 
01:29:19.610 --> 01:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
on slide 62 you can see what we've done
 
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
with that to date so we're going to
 
01:29:24.770 --> 01:29:24.780 align:start position:0%
transfer 40 million dollars in total but
 
01:29:26.689 --> 01:29:26.699 align:start position:0%
we cannot transfer more than four
 
01:29:30.890 --> 01:29:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
um so in fiscal 2020 that was the first
 
01:29:35.090 --> 01:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
year that rims was operational we did
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
not transfer any money the system was
 
01:29:38.689 --> 01:29:38.699 align:start position:0%
just up and running we hadn't received
 
01:29:42.169 --> 01:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
any additional uplift in fiscal year 22
 
01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
we Tran or 21 excuse me we transferred
 
01:29:47.629 --> 01:29:47.639 align:start position:0%
2.2 million dollars and then in fiscal
 
01:29:50.689 --> 01:29:50.699 align:start position:0%
22 we transferred the four the full four
 
01:29:52.189 --> 01:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
you will see in the chart at the bottom
 
01:29:57.290 --> 01:29:57.300 align:start position:0%
the total revenue uplift we realized in
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 was actually 5.3 million but
 
01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
we were capped at that four million
 
01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
dollar amount so that's why it was only
 
01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
4 million and not the 5.3
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
we've done this
 
01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
um we've achieved this Revenue uplift in
 
01:30:15.709 --> 01:30:15.719 align:start position:0%
a couple of a couple of ways one is
 
01:30:18.110 --> 01:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
um the system allows us to automatically
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
send a reminder to pay letter
 
01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
so before rims we would issue a tax
 
01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:24.290 align:start position:0%
so before rims we would issue a tax
notice

01:30:24.290 --> 01:30:24.300 align:start position:0%
notice
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
and we would not contact you again until
 
01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
you didn't pay that notice and you ended
 
01:30:29.930 --> 01:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
up in collections
 
01:30:33.169 --> 01:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
now after 30 days we send you a nice
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
note that just reminds you that we had
 
01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
sent you
 
01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
a bill and that you need to pay it and
 
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
so just that reminder has generated
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
a good portion of this amount
 
01:30:49.850 --> 01:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
we also now have more efficient use of
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
data that we receive from the federal
 
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
government in order to ensure compliance
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
with with New Hampshire laws so we can
 
01:31:00.169 --> 01:31:00.179 align:start position:0%
look at Federal data we can see that a
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
business may have a filing obligation we
 
01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
can see that they have not met their
 
01:31:05.810 --> 01:31:05.820 align:start position:0%
filing obligation in New Hampshire and
 
01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
we can proactively reach out to that
 
01:31:10.850 --> 01:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
business so better use of federal tax
 
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:19.970 --> 01:31:19.980 align:start position:0%
I have a question then we'll go to
 
01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:20.870 align:start position:0%
I have a question then we'll go to
others

01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:22.669 align:start position:0%
others
um

01:31:22.669 --> 01:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:25.370 --> 01:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
I believe I have a login to this system
 
01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
and I and I I guess my question is if
 
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
you have multiple and can you have
 
01:31:33.290 --> 01:31:33.300 align:start position:0%
multiple entities on the same login you
 
01:31:36.649 --> 01:31:36.659 align:start position:0%
can so if you were an uh restaurant for
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
instance you could have your meals and
 
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
rentals tax license and also your
 
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
business tax license would show under
 
01:31:46.010 --> 01:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
the same login if you operate multiple
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
businesses you can have multiple
 
01:31:51.290 --> 01:31:51.300 align:start position:0%
businesses show under your login if you
 
01:31:54.649 --> 01:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
are a tax preparer you can
 
01:31:54.659 --> 01:31:55.250 align:start position:0%
are a tax preparer you can
um

01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:57.890 --> 01:31:57.900 align:start position:0%
log into your account and so long as
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
your clients have granted you access you
 
01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
can see the various accounts of your
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
different clients and what you can do
 
01:32:07.010 --> 01:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
under those accounts might differ for
 
01:32:09.050 --> 01:32:09.060 align:start position:0%
each client right I might say sure
 
01:32:10.970 --> 01:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
representative you can look at my
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
account but I don't want you filing
 
01:32:14.090 --> 01:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
anything on my behalf
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
Keane may say you can file all my
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
returns for me
 
01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
um so taxpayers can set those individual
 
01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:21.910 align:start position:0%
um so taxpayers can set those individual
parameters

01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
parameters
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
for their their practitioners okay great
 
01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll start on this side of
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
the room this time represent ours
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for uh that
 
01:32:36.290 --> 01:32:36.300 align:start position:0%
report it's very interesting that you're
 
01:32:38.810 --> 01:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
able to do that through to covid having
 
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
worked with the Department of Defense in
 
01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
London Scotland and here in a couple of
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
agencies auditing and com uh as a
 
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
program manager
 
01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
it's impressive that you did it on time
 
01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
on budget I hope you got an award you're
 
01:33:02.090 --> 01:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
you and your team thank you thank you
 
01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
yes representative Bolton
 
01:33:07.729 --> 01:33:07.739 align:start position:0%
regarding the um the needs to go from
 
01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
Cobalt which is not supported to at
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
least a platform that is supported now
 
01:33:15.410 --> 01:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
is it being maintained off-site or is it
 
01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
is do it maintaining it so
 
01:33:22.370 --> 01:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so it's um
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
I guess a little bit of a hybrid so the
 
01:33:26.870 --> 01:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
the actual physical Hardware is located
 
01:33:30.649 --> 01:33:30.659 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire at Hazen drive and
 
01:33:33.290 --> 01:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
the maintenance of the system is done in
 
01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
conjunction with dra employees doit
 
01:33:38.810 --> 01:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
employees and we do still have vendor
 
01:33:41.209 --> 01:33:41.219 align:start position:0%
employees on site so at the height of
 
01:33:43.610 --> 01:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
implementation we were probably at 30 to
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
35 vendor employees and we're down to
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
about eight to ten I anticipate and
 
01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
we're asking for in our operating budget
 
01:33:53.930 --> 01:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
to maintain a level of the vendor
 
01:33:56.570 --> 01:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
employees for a couple more years as we
 
01:33:59.450 --> 01:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
make sure that we can continue to
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
maintain this system because it is such
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
a big change going from the Cobalt
 
01:34:06.050 --> 01:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
system to this more modern system pull
 
01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:06.830 align:start position:0%
system to this more modern system pull
up

01:34:06.830 --> 01:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
01:34:10.129 --> 01:34:10.139 align:start position:0%
um so regarding
 
01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
um the maintenance that do it on Hayes
 
01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
and drive
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
um they have normal business hours and
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
you want us to support outside of
 
01:34:20.209 --> 01:34:20.219 align:start position:0%
business hours correct so we have an
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
agreement with the vendor for um 24 7
 
01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
monitoring so we do have the ability to
 
01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
make sure that the system is up and
 
01:34:31.010 --> 01:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
running at all times so they have remote
 
01:34:32.930 --> 01:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
monitoring for the times that we're not
 
01:34:37.850 --> 01:34:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
okay representative Almy
 
01:34:44.930 --> 01:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:50.450 --> 01:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.850 --> 01:34:52.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:34:54.590 --> 01:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question commissioner stepp I
 
01:34:56.350 --> 01:34:56.360 align:start position:0%
think yes you are to be commended for
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
this uh implementation I was here and uh
 
01:35:02.689 --> 01:35:02.699 align:start position:0%
year when we looked at that 30 million
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
and said let's go so it's and your
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
report out today was uh really nice to
 
01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
hear all that I have a question about
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
that 29 million uh
 
01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
consult a fee uh maybe it was it was
 
01:35:22.729 --> 01:35:22.739 align:start position:0%
buried in all those numbers that you put
 
01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
through there but uh that 29 million is
 
01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
coming from where how does that factor
 
01:35:32.689 --> 01:35:32.699 align:start position:0%
into the uh sir where does that come
 
01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
from sure so the 29 million 550 000 is
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
from the 30 million one hundred and
 
01:35:40.850 --> 01:35:40.860 align:start position:0%
sixty thousand dollar Capital
 
01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:43.430 align:start position:0%
sixty thousand dollar Capital
appropriation

01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
01:35:46.970 --> 01:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
um and that was funding for the
 
01:35:50.689 --> 01:35:50.699 align:start position:0%
three-year implementation of rims
 
01:35:52.970 --> 01:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
um Basic Hardware and software
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
maintenance for seven years and some
 
01:35:58.669 --> 01:35:58.679 align:start position:0%
additional post implementation support
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
we will be requesting in our operating
 
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
budget to kind of maintain that
 
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
additional post implementation support
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
the difference between the 29 550 and
 
01:36:13.610 --> 01:36:13.620 align:start position:0%
the 3160 is we had
 
01:36:16.629 --> 01:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
um a vendor Barry done perform
 
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
Independent Health assessments of the
 
01:36:21.169 --> 01:36:21.179 align:start position:0%
project as we went through it so they
 
01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
would come in a couple times a year they
 
01:36:25.550 --> 01:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
would look at documentation about the
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
the status of the project they would
 
01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:28.510 align:start position:0%
the status of the project they would
interview

01:36:28.510 --> 01:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
interview
 
01:36:32.930 --> 01:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
doit staff dra staff and vendor staff to
 
01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
make sure that the project was healthy I
 
01:36:39.050 --> 01:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
felt nervous about being in charge of 30
 
01:36:40.610 --> 01:36:40.620 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
um for one project and wanted to make
 
01:36:45.290 --> 01:36:45.300 align:start position:0%
sure that the project was moving along
 
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
smoothly because on any given day the
 
01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
project manager of the vendor could have
 
01:36:51.910 --> 01:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
been like yeah yeah everything's fine
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
and I worried we would get to the end of
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
the project and we would be missing
 
01:36:57.890 --> 01:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
things or things wouldn't be the way
 
01:37:00.290 --> 01:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
that they should be so we we contracted
 
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
with Barry Dunn to do these periodic
 
01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
Health assessments I can provide anyone
 
01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
that would like a copy of them they were
 
01:37:09.169 --> 01:37:09.179 align:start position:0%
all glowing and they reassured us that
 
01:37:11.090 --> 01:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
we were on the right track in terms of
 
01:37:12.649 --> 01:37:12.659 align:start position:0%
making sure that this project was going
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:16.790 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:37:19.610 --> 01:37:19.620 align:start position:0%
does that same vendor provide security
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
or is there another vendor that provides
 
01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
security for the system
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
so security is provided through fast
 
01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
Enterprises however we have contracted
 
01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
recently with new Harbor through Dubai T
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
to do a security assessment and to do
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
penetration testing and we will keep up
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
those assessments with the assistance of
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
vendors and doit going forward so we
 
01:37:47.090 --> 01:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
make sure that the system is functional
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
but also secure thank you
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.090 --> 01:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
money is
 
01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
increases in males and Romans interest
 
01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
in dividends probably some of the others
 
01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:38:10.450 --> 01:38:10.460 align:start position:0%
on does it get
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
removed from the amount that shows up at
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
some point on each year
 
01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
good question so the amounts are
 
01:38:23.930 --> 01:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
transferred once the fiscal year has
 
01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
closed and would be accounted for in the
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
ACT first so if you're looking at Cash
 
01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
basis numbers which is what we typically
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
look at the cash basis numbers will
 
01:38:35.689 --> 01:38:35.699 align:start position:0%
include this four million dollars
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
they're essentially removed in the
 
01:38:39.530 --> 01:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
accounting adjustments that happen
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
between the close of the year and the
 
01:38:43.850 --> 01:38:43.860 align:start position:0%
act for so they show up in the kafir
 
01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:45.530 align:start position:0%
act for so they show up in the kafir
correct

01:38:45.530 --> 01:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman a great overview
 
01:38:53.450 --> 01:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
process I noticed on a page 40 an
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
example you listed factors influence and
 
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
revenue you did that on a bunch of the
 
01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:03.490 align:start position:0%
revenue you did that on a bunch of the
pages

01:39:03.490 --> 01:39:03.500 align:start position:0%
pages
 
01:39:07.129 --> 01:39:07.139 align:start position:0%
the dra uses historical Trends and does
 
01:39:10.270 --> 01:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
static analysis
 
01:39:12.410 --> 01:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
do you see
 
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
any probability of the dra using an
 
01:39:18.649 --> 01:39:18.659 align:start position:0%
organization to do future probability
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
analysis to help you
 
01:39:23.149 --> 01:39:23.159 align:start position:0%
maybe see what a trend is going to be in
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
the future
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
I think that's a a great question
 
01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.209 align:start position:0%
I think that's a a great question
um

01:39:29.209 --> 01:39:29.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:31.070 --> 01:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned we have typically in
 
01:39:34.430 --> 01:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
the past done a static analysis so we
 
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
have looked at you know if this change
 
01:39:39.890 --> 01:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
were to have happened last year how
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
would last year's revenues be impacted
 
01:39:43.970 --> 01:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
by that change
 
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
we have not when we do that sort of
 
01:39:49.729 --> 01:39:49.739 align:start position:0%
analysis we don't take into account
 
01:39:49.739 --> 01:39:50.390 align:start position:0%
analysis we don't take into account
um

01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:54.290 --> 01:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
would that change influence behavior and
 
01:39:57.290 --> 01:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
therefore then cause revenues of maybe
 
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
another tax type to increase or decrease
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
or revenues within that tax type to
 
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease
 
01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:04.250 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease
um

01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
I think the the hardest thing about
 
01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
doing a more Dynamic analysis is one
 
01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:11.930 align:start position:0%
doing a more Dynamic analysis is one
Manpower

01:40:11.930 --> 01:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
Manpower
 
01:40:14.689 --> 01:40:14.699 align:start position:0%
um we are a small agency and a small
 
01:40:17.570 --> 01:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
group that does this work
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
um so certainly with additional Staffing
 
01:40:20.159 --> 01:40:21.649 align:start position:0%
um so certainly with additional Staffing
that's

01:40:21.649 --> 01:40:21.659 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:40:22.970 --> 01:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
um something that we might be able to
 
01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
consider or with additional funding we
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
could contract out to a consultant or a
 
01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
third party that does that sort of work
 
01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I would know is
 
01:40:35.090 --> 01:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
that typically that sort of work
 
01:40:38.990 --> 01:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
um a more Dynamic analysis is usually
 
01:40:41.209 --> 01:40:41.219 align:start position:0%
fairly time consuming and we're
 
01:40:44.209 --> 01:40:44.219 align:start position:0%
operating under pretty
 
01:40:46.669 --> 01:40:46.679 align:start position:0%
um strict time constraints within a
 
01:40:49.790 --> 01:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
legislative session this is no fault of
 
01:40:51.649 --> 01:40:51.659 align:start position:0%
Chris's but when the LBA sends us a
 
01:40:54.290 --> 01:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
fiscal note to complete they asked for
 
01:40:56.149 --> 01:40:56.159 align:start position:0%
it back within five days because they're
 
01:40:57.530 --> 01:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
trying to get it on the bill and get the
 
01:40:59.330 --> 01:40:59.340 align:start position:0%
bill published so you all can have that
 
01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:00.310 align:start position:0%
bill published so you all can have that
information

01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
five days is probably not enough time
 
01:41:05.209 --> 01:41:05.219 align:start position:0%
for us to do a more sophisticated
 
01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
Dynamic analysis that being said though
 
01:41:10.970 --> 01:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
there may be opportunities where a tax
 
01:41:13.070 --> 01:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
policy choice or tax policy
 
01:41:15.890 --> 01:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
consideration or option that could be
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
evaluated over a longer period of time
 
01:41:20.450 --> 01:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
and not the five-day turnaround for a
 
01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
fiscal note could benefit from that sort
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
of analysis something that comes to mind
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
is you know the school funding
 
01:41:28.129 --> 01:41:28.139 align:start position:0%
commission that operated a few years ago
 
01:41:31.010 --> 01:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
that commission had an appropriation to
 
01:41:33.890 --> 01:41:33.900 align:start position:0%
spend money on a consultant to have
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
those resources to provide that
 
01:41:38.270 --> 01:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
so long story short it's a resource
 
01:41:40.370 --> 01:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
whether it's people money or time
 
01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:43.010 align:start position:0%
whether it's people money or time
constraint

01:41:43.010 --> 01:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
constraint
 
01:41:44.930 --> 01:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
representative Ellery
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
two things to know keep the first one to
 
01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:48.410 align:start position:0%
two things to know keep the first one to
um

01:41:48.410 --> 01:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
this issue and the second one deals with
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:55.669 --> 01:41:55.679 align:start position:0%
how could you find out how much Watson
 
01:41:58.689 --> 01:41:58.699 align:start position:0%
costs per hour just let us know
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
I mean I can put a line in my operating
 
01:42:05.689 --> 01:42:05.699 align:start position:0%
budget for Watson a crystal ball a magic
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
eight ball I look for crystal balls
 
01:42:11.090 --> 01:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
there's a damned expensive okay
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
um and then just for the committee sure
 
01:42:14.639 --> 01:42:28.970 align:start position:0%
um and then just for the committee sure
um

01:42:28.970 --> 01:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
I think uh representative Murray wanted
 
01:42:34.669 --> 01:42:34.679 align:start position:0%
to tell us all about uh put your
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
so um the the news is that uh
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh Gary Hopper uh honorable Gary foper
 
01:42:50.209 --> 01:42:50.219 align:start position:0%
has has died
 
01:42:52.669 --> 01:42:52.679 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to hear that
 
01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:00.530 --> 01:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
representative Almy
 
01:43:03.890 --> 01:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
thank you I had one small question and a
 
01:43:06.410 --> 01:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
something else about the dynamic
 
01:43:10.850 --> 01:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
analysis options on a small question is
 
01:43:14.930 --> 01:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
are people who file by paper
 
01:43:17.330 --> 01:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
still allowed to do it they are still
 
01:43:20.450 --> 01:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
allowed to do it we
 
01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
do not have a Prohibition against paper
 
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
filing some states do we are not one of
 
01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:27.609 align:start position:0%
filing some states do we are not one of
those

01:43:27.609 --> 01:43:27.619 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
we have as part of the front end of our
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
rims system we have two high-speed
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
scanners that process those paper
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
returns so if you fill out a return
 
01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:43.010 align:start position:0%
returns so if you fill out a return
online

01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
online
 
01:43:45.229 --> 01:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
um and print it and mail it to us
 
01:43:48.590 --> 01:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
there's a 2d barcode that's generated as
 
01:43:50.810 --> 01:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
part of that return and our scanners
 
01:43:52.609 --> 01:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
pick up the information that you entered
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
through that 2D barcode if you hand
 
01:43:57.649 --> 01:43:57.659 align:start position:0%
write your return many people do our
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
scanners are able to read handwriting
 
01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
um and they will well they will attempt
 
01:44:06.590 --> 01:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
to read handwriting I will say and for
 
01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
anything that this scanner has trouble
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
reading it will prompt a human our data
 
01:44:13.970 --> 01:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
entry folks will be prompted to review
 
01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
what the return says and enter the
 
01:44:20.510 --> 01:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
amounts we will or we did receive some
 
01:44:23.709 --> 01:44:23.719 align:start position:0%
arpa funds to upgrade our scanner
 
01:44:26.209 --> 01:44:26.219 align:start position:0%
because one of our scanners is at the
 
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
end of life so we will be disposing of
 
01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
that scanner we will be purchasing a
 
01:44:33.129 --> 01:44:33.139 align:start position:0%
brand new scanner and we will be
 
01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:35.580 align:start position:0%
rehabbing our existing scanner so that
 
01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
we can still have two running at the
 
01:44:39.169 --> 01:44:39.179 align:start position:0%
same time my biggest fear is that our
 
01:44:42.050 --> 01:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
scanners go down on April 16th so we
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
always want to make sure that we have 2
 
01:44:45.770 --> 01:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
two of them going at any time
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
we also obviously receive electronic
 
01:44:50.810 --> 01:44:50.820 align:start position:0%
returns so similar to you filing your
 
01:44:53.570 --> 01:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
federal tax return via the irs's
 
01:44:56.750 --> 01:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
modified e-file program you would file
 
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
your return essentially goes to the IRS
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
the IRS carves off the New Hampshire
 
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
piece and sends it to us so we also
 
01:45:04.669 --> 01:45:04.679 align:start position:0%
receive many returns electronically but
 
01:45:08.209 --> 01:45:08.219 align:start position:0%
we're always happy to have paper as well
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and could I follow up meant
 
01:45:14.570 --> 01:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
this is not a follow-up this is okay
 
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
about the dynamic analysis I was going
 
01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
to put in a bill
 
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
this year and I had a health emergency
 
01:45:28.189 --> 01:45:28.199 align:start position:0%
and I had prepared it two months ahead
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
of time and I've forgot about it
 
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
during that brief window we had on which
 
01:45:38.930 --> 01:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
looks at something like but I think that
 
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
the only place that does it is Remy
 
01:45:44.050 --> 01:45:44.060 align:start position:0%

01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:45.609 align:start position:0%

uh

01:46:01.310 --> 01:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
working for 40 years now the gentleman
 
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
that started it
 
01:46:12.370 --> 01:46:12.380 align:start position:0%
built an original model to look at at on
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
trying to predict the future for things
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
like this on and they work only and
 
01:46:25.010 --> 01:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
there there are I think 28 of them in
 
01:46:28.970 --> 01:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
total on in the countries they are based
 
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
in DC but they have an office in Amherst
 
01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:33.790 align:start position:0%
in DC but they have an office in Amherst
Massachusetts

01:46:33.790 --> 01:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
and they work with States and
 
01:46:41.330 --> 01:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
municipalities only and counties they
 
01:46:43.970 --> 01:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
will not work with non-governmental
 
01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:45.410 align:start position:0%
will not work with non-governmental
institutions

01:46:45.410 --> 01:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
01:46:50.930 --> 01:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
and we actually a couple of us uh
 
01:46:53.689 --> 01:46:53.699 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg and I and Jerry
 
01:46:55.729 --> 01:46:55.739 align:start position:0%
Stringham we'd hope to have back in the
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
committee uh he's in finance
 
01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:01.250 align:start position:0%
committee uh he's in finance
on

01:47:01.250 --> 01:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
talked with them this Summer and we
 
01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639 align:start position:0%
wanted as a next step to be bringing in
 
01:47:08.639 --> 01:47:09.649 align:start position:0%
wanted as a next step to be bringing in
on

01:47:09.649 --> 01:47:09.659 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:47:12.410 --> 01:47:12.420 align:start position:0%
representative abrami to this
 
01:47:15.290 --> 01:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
conversation that didn't work out either
 
01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:16.970 align:start position:0%
conversation that didn't work out either
uh

01:47:16.970 --> 01:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:47:20.810 --> 01:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
but uh it when we talked to them we
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
discovered that we already have a Remy
 
01:47:29.149 --> 01:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
group in New Hampshire it consists of
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
gotlop Ryan gottlow
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
and he went to
 
01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:35.689 align:start position:0%
and he went to
um

01:47:35.689 --> 01:47:35.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:38.169 --> 01:47:38.179 align:start position:0%
the on security
 
01:47:41.450 --> 01:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
employment security group because they
 
01:47:43.669 --> 01:47:43.679 align:start position:0%
would let him do this
 
01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
working in multivariate analysis all of
 
01:47:51.050 --> 01:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
his life and this is kind of the gold
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
star of it as far as I've been able to
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
determine but um
 
01:48:00.290 --> 01:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
I went in skeptical I don't know I did
 
01:48:02.090 --> 01:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
too representative almond do you have a
 
01:48:03.950 --> 01:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
question first it's not really a
 
01:48:07.010 --> 01:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
question is just information as this is
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
an alternative that uh we could put
 
01:48:12.410 --> 01:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
somewhere and you were talking about
 
01:48:13.850 --> 01:48:13.860 align:start position:0%
things that
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
we can't re it can't be contracted out
 
01:48:19.510 --> 01:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
it has to be something with one person
 
01:48:22.729 --> 01:48:22.739 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the institution and the
 
01:48:27.169 --> 01:48:27.179 align:start position:0%
bill I put in was to try to to set up a
 
01:48:31.790 --> 01:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
commission to decide where and how and
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
if of course
 
01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:35.689 align:start position:0%
if of course
but

01:48:35.689 --> 01:48:35.699 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:48:37.729 --> 01:48:37.739 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:48:41.090 --> 01:48:41.100 align:start position:0%
um any questions on the presentation as
 
01:48:43.669 --> 01:48:43.679 align:start position:0%
a whole any of the taxes that um
 
01:48:48.169 --> 01:48:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none thank you very much a
 
01:48:52.669 --> 01:48:52.679 align:start position:0%
great presentation very informative
 
01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll see you on Thursday
 
01:49:03.050 --> 01:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:05.209 --> 01:49:05.219 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we have
 
01:49:14.990 --> 01:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:19.010 --> 01:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:20.270 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:49:20.270 --> 01:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
um I guess going back to a
 
01:49:26.030 --> 01:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative plett's suggestion of
 
01:49:29.090 --> 01:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
you know hitting these in order of um
 
01:49:31.490 --> 01:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
size I mean we don't necessarily do that
 
01:49:34.250 --> 01:49:34.260 align:start position:0%
correct it's more like we start with the
 
01:49:36.169 --> 01:49:36.179 align:start position:0%
ones that are more predictable
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
and um so if you can correct I think it
 
01:49:41.330 --> 01:49:41.340 align:start position:0%
takes sweat for example it's a 363
 
01:49:42.530 --> 01:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
million dollar
 
01:49:44.629 --> 01:49:44.639 align:start position:0%
uh Revenue stream
 
01:49:46.250 --> 01:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
set by Statute you're going to get that
 
01:49:48.290 --> 01:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
same amount so this committee can easily
 
01:49:49.609 --> 01:49:49.619 align:start position:0%
make a decision that they want to stick
 
01:49:51.590 --> 01:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
with that number unless you're going to
 
01:49:54.649 --> 01:49:54.659 align:start position:0%
introduce something new related to that
 
01:49:56.570 --> 01:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
um I think what you've seen this
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee do is tackle what we would
 
01:50:01.729 --> 01:50:01.739 align:start position:0%
consider those easier Revenue sources
 
01:50:04.970 --> 01:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
such as a lot of what the agencies that
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
have already come into you so maybe
 
01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:09.050 align:start position:0%
have already come into you so maybe
Insurance

01:50:09.050 --> 01:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
Insurance
 
01:50:11.570 --> 01:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
um maybe the securities
 
01:50:15.290 --> 01:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
you know um maybe the HHS amounts so you
 
01:50:16.430 --> 01:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
might look at some of these and say okay
 
01:50:18.590 --> 01:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
as a group we don't feel we can have
 
01:50:20.090 --> 01:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
anything to add or change to those
 
01:50:21.590 --> 01:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates that they provided so
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
we can feel comfortable with those
 
01:50:25.609 --> 01:50:25.619 align:start position:0%
numbers the ones that you tend to
 
01:50:28.129 --> 01:50:28.139 align:start position:0%
um focus on and spend a little bit more
 
01:50:29.810 --> 01:50:29.820 align:start position:0%
time with would be the things like your
 
01:50:33.890 --> 01:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
business taxes your ret your IND
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
um your meals and rooms those seem to be
 
01:50:37.609 --> 01:50:37.619 align:start position:0%
the taxes where there's a little bit
 
01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
more flexibility a little bit more
 
01:50:40.970 --> 01:50:40.980 align:start position:0%
thought put into because there's a lot
 
01:50:44.689 --> 01:50:44.699 align:start position:0%
more influencing how those taxes come in
 
01:50:48.590 --> 01:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
um what our our job is or my job is is
 
01:50:51.050 --> 01:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
to provide you with a worksheet and help
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
guide you through the process but you
 
01:50:54.350 --> 01:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
direct that process overall so you
 
01:50:56.209 --> 01:50:56.219 align:start position:0%
decide when when you're ready to say
 
01:50:58.550 --> 01:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
this is the tax we want to work on today
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
so on as a segue
 
01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
um Thursday you're going to be meeting
 
01:51:06.890 --> 01:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
you're going to start with dra so the
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner and her team will come back
 
01:51:10.010 --> 01:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
and they'll give you some of their
 
01:51:11.810 --> 01:51:11.820 align:start position:0%
estimates related to the revenue streams
 
01:51:14.330 --> 01:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
that you need to do projections for
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
they'll take as much time on Thursday as
 
01:51:18.109 --> 01:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
they need to with you and when they're
 
01:51:20.450 --> 01:51:20.460 align:start position:0%
done I'll come up to the table and say
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay here's these other Revenue taxes
 
01:51:26.570 --> 01:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
excuse me these other revenues that if
 
01:51:27.950 --> 01:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
you're comfortable you can start making
 
01:51:29.870 --> 01:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
some decisions but if you're not and you
 
01:51:31.490 --> 01:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
think you need an agency to come back
 
01:51:33.530 --> 01:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
let me know so that I can get them
 
01:51:35.689 --> 01:51:35.699 align:start position:0%
scheduled to come back for you
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
so that will be the second part of
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
Thursday again I don't know how long all
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
this will take and it's you need to be
 
01:51:43.609 --> 01:51:43.619 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the information you
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
you're getting
 
01:51:47.930 --> 01:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
um yep between now and Thursday if
 
01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
people have questions please shoot them
 
01:51:52.030 --> 01:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
my way you know the email call me
 
01:51:54.410 --> 01:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
particularly if it's related to the dra
 
01:51:56.030 --> 01:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
stuff so that I can let the commissioner
 
01:51:57.530 --> 01:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
know so they can come prepared to
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
respond to that
 
01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:00.709 align:start position:0%
respond to that
um

01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:03.649 --> 01:52:03.659 align:start position:0%
also you've got scheduled dates in
 
01:52:07.129 --> 01:52:07.139 align:start position:0%
February February 27th and 28th and
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
March 1st to come back and finalize I
 
01:52:12.770 --> 01:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
think your estimates right now you have
 
01:52:15.050 --> 01:52:15.060 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget director coming in
 
01:52:17.149 --> 01:52:17.159 align:start position:0%
on the 27th he was originally scheduled
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
to come in on the 26th
 
01:52:22.129 --> 01:52:22.139 align:start position:0%
22nd but that date has been canceled due
 
01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
to potential session day so he'll be
 
01:52:26.030 --> 01:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
available to answer any questions you
 
01:52:27.229 --> 01:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
might have as it relates to the
 
01:52:29.629 --> 01:52:29.639 align:start position:0%
governor's Revenue estimates on that
 
01:52:32.270 --> 01:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
Tuesday February 28th you have
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
um Employment Security coming back with
 
01:52:36.290 --> 01:52:36.300 align:start position:0%
an update the committee had requested
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
last week if you could have that if we
 
01:52:39.770 --> 01:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
could have them come back to provide
 
01:52:41.890 --> 01:52:41.900 align:start position:0%
some information to you as in terms of
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
Workforce issues they might be seeing in
 
01:52:47.149 --> 01:52:47.159 align:start position:0%
terms of good or bad Trends so that's
 
01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
going to be their focus but they also
 
01:52:51.229 --> 01:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
understand there may be other employment
 
01:52:53.570 --> 01:52:53.580 align:start position:0%
related questions that may come to them
 
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
so that's who I have for you in the next
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
two weeks
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
excellent uh we have some questions
 
01:53:03.950 --> 01:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
um when can you tell me what the
 
01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
governor's estimates are going to look
 
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
like is it going to be a spreadsheet or
 
01:53:14.930 --> 01:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
and do we get it before
 
01:53:17.689 --> 01:53:17.699 align:start position:0%
his director comes and speaks to us so
 
01:53:18.890 --> 01:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
we can look at it and think about
 
01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:20.209 align:start position:0%
we can look at it and think about
questions

01:53:20.209 --> 01:53:20.219 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
so tomorrow when the governor comes and
 
01:53:25.310 --> 01:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
presents to the legislature you'll have
 
01:53:28.129 --> 01:53:28.139 align:start position:0%
a an executive summary that will be
 
01:53:30.229 --> 01:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
presented so it'll be a printed document
 
01:53:32.330 --> 01:53:32.340 align:start position:0%
in there would be the revenues and they
 
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
would be listed similar to you see the
 
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenues listed now so
 
01:53:40.250 --> 01:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
you'd see his projections for 23 24 and
 
01:53:40.260 --> 01:53:42.290 align:start position:0%
you'd see his projections for 23 24 and
25.

01:53:42.290 --> 01:53:42.300 align:start position:0%
25.
 
01:53:44.330 --> 01:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't be in a spreadsheet per
 
01:53:46.609 --> 01:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
se it'll be in a table format but but
 
01:53:48.770 --> 01:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
Chris you'll end up putting them into a
 
01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet for us yes so the worksheet
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
that we keep talking about that many of
 
01:53:55.070 --> 01:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
you probably haven't seen
 
01:53:56.209 --> 01:53:56.219 align:start position:0%
um will have the governor's information
 
01:53:58.850 --> 01:53:58.860 align:start position:0%
included on that so it should be a
 
01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:00.719 align:start position:0%
One-Stop shop for you so you'd have a
 
01:54:02.450 --> 01:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
document in front of you that you'll be
 
01:54:04.490 --> 01:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
able to see
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
um 22's planned revenues what the ACT
 
01:54:12.410 --> 01:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
first 22 revenues were 23 plan then the
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
governor's estimates agency estimates
 
01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:16.250 align:start position:0%
governor's estimates agency estimates
um

01:54:16.250 --> 01:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:18.290 --> 01:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
and then your estimates and that would
 
01:54:21.649 --> 01:54:21.659 align:start position:0%
be the same for 24 and 25. follow up and
 
01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
so when when we get it in that format
 
01:54:27.229 --> 01:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
the one that you've put together we'll
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
have more back history a couple more
 
01:54:33.410 --> 01:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
columns going back so we can look at
 
01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:34.970 align:start position:0%
columns going back so we can look at
pre-covered

01:54:34.970 --> 01:54:34.980 align:start position:0%
pre-covered
 
01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
not necessarily no it just shows you 22
 
01:54:40.729 --> 01:54:40.739 align:start position:0%
23 24 25. I
 
01:54:43.129 --> 01:54:43.139 align:start position:0%
the the back history would be in some of
 
01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
the information you've been Gathering to
 
01:54:47.629 --> 01:54:47.639 align:start position:0%
this point the act for has the 10-year
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
plan or excuse me the 10-year showing of
 
01:54:52.850 --> 01:54:52.860 align:start position:0%
revenues so you can get a sense of how
 
01:54:57.290 --> 01:54:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:59.209 --> 01:54:59.219 align:start position:0%
but if there's something specific I
 
01:55:01.070 --> 01:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
think last uh last week you had asked
 
01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
about the tobacco settlement money and
 
01:55:05.450 --> 01:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
there was a request to have a 10-year
 
01:55:07.490 --> 01:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
look at that and I've sent something out
 
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
to the committee related to that to
 
01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
basically show the projections that were
 
01:55:12.649 --> 01:55:12.659 align:start position:0%
made by the doj and then where the
 
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:18.410 --> 01:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
representative ulery
 
01:55:21.169 --> 01:55:21.179 align:start position:0%
thank you just just so the committee is
 
01:55:23.629 --> 01:55:23.639 align:start position:0%
clear we're not looking at the budget
 
01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
we're only looking at the governor's
 
01:55:29.330 --> 01:55:29.340 align:start position:0%
estimates and our estimates the budget
 
01:55:31.970 --> 01:55:31.980 align:start position:0%
itself will be up at the top of the hall
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
and finance and they get what 1200 Pages
 
01:55:37.790 --> 01:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
or so uh
 
01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:39.169 align:start position:0%
or so uh
stuff

01:55:39.169 --> 01:55:39.179 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
01:55:41.570 --> 01:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
there's another word for that but
 
01:55:41.580 --> 01:55:44.270 align:start position:0%
there's another word for that but
okay

01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:46.609 --> 01:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
representative almi
 
01:55:48.590 --> 01:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
two things we we used to get uh much
 
01:55:54.890 --> 01:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
more information from insurance about
 
01:55:57.890 --> 01:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
the context of their numbers
 
01:56:00.649 --> 01:56:00.659 align:start position:0%
and then we've gotten this time
 
01:56:02.930 --> 01:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
they would talk to us about hard markets
 
01:56:07.310 --> 01:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
and soft markets and on the property and
 
01:56:12.169 --> 01:56:12.179 align:start position:0%
Casualty versus the the on health and
 
01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
Etc on and I didn't see any of that in
 
01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
what we got I just saw some numbers
 
01:56:22.910 --> 01:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh that's I think I think you're
 
01:56:24.350 --> 01:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
um if the committee would like them to
 
01:56:28.010 --> 01:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
come back and go deeper into their how
 
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
they get to their revenue estimates that
 
01:56:31.370 --> 01:56:31.380 align:start position:0%
would be an agency we could ask to come
 
01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
back on the 27th or 28th whether the
 
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
market is hard or soft in various
 
01:56:38.990 --> 01:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
categories does change what their
 
01:56:41.149 --> 01:56:41.159 align:start position:0%
numbers are I think the commissioner
 
01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
touched upon that briefly during the
 
01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
presentation but it wasn't written in
 
01:56:46.669 --> 01:56:46.679 align:start position:0%
the in the presentation
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
but again I I take direction from the
 
01:56:51.890 --> 01:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
committee if the committee's decision is
 
01:56:54.290 --> 01:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
to have them come back then I I will do
 
01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
that so I would defer to the the chair
 
01:56:58.850 --> 01:56:58.860 align:start position:0%
and vice chair to let me know who they
 
01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
need to have come back do we do you
 
01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
remember how much variability we
 
01:57:05.330 --> 01:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
typically see
 
01:57:09.770 --> 01:57:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:13.129 --> 01:57:13.139 align:start position:0%
um not from what they plan to what you
 
01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
actually collect well from year to year
 
01:57:19.790 --> 01:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
I would say no I mean I think compared
 
01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
to what they present to you and what
 
01:57:25.729 --> 01:57:25.739 align:start position:0%
they actually collect are fairly similar
 
01:57:27.290 --> 01:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
numbers there may be some slight
 
01:57:29.149 --> 01:57:29.159 align:start position:0%
adjustments up
 
01:57:30.530 --> 01:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
um and I think you're seeing that right
 
01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:31.970 align:start position:0%
um and I think you're seeing that right
now

01:57:31.970 --> 01:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
I sent out to the committee at a revised
 
01:57:38.030 --> 01:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
estimate for 23 for insurance it also
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
had Lottery commissions information on
 
01:57:43.010 --> 01:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
it I sent that out on Friday
 
01:57:44.510 --> 01:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
um so you'll see that they bump their
 
01:57:48.169 --> 01:57:48.179 align:start position:0%
number up from 135 million 423 up to 139
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
million but it didn't have any impact on
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
the 24-25 estimates again it's partly
 
01:57:54.410 --> 01:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
because of the way they collect that
 
01:57:55.609 --> 01:57:55.619 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream
 
01:57:58.250 --> 01:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
01:58:01.070 --> 01:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
um representative roachford yes thank
 
01:58:04.490 --> 01:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
you um so we've heard a lot of taxes and
 
01:58:06.649 --> 01:58:06.659 align:start position:0%
one of the taxes that I've seen just in
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
passing and uh and we haven't expanded
 
01:58:13.070 --> 01:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
on it because maybe it's dedicated as
 
01:58:15.530 --> 01:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
the beer tax
 
01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:16.930 align:start position:0%
the beer tax
foreign

01:58:16.930 --> 01:58:16.940 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
that was in with Liquor's presentation
 
01:58:21.050 --> 01:58:21.060 align:start position:0%
it was one line
 
01:58:22.729 --> 01:58:22.739 align:start position:0%
no that that's fine because it doesn't
 
01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
really get talked about it's about 13.1
 
01:58:27.229 --> 01:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
to 2 million a year
 
01:58:28.970 --> 01:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't change really there's not
 
01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
much fluctuation to that what the Liquor
 
01:58:33.169 --> 01:58:33.179 align:start position:0%
Commission has testified to in the past
 
01:58:34.970 --> 01:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
is that the
 
01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:35.629 align:start position:0%
