00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
anyone we should discuss any any parts
 
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
deals with uh synthetic drugs and
 
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
the overwhelming majority of synthetic
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
drugs trying to stand up manufactured in
 
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
china and the biggest problem you have
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
with the synthetic drug
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a natural one think of
 
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:14.870 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a natural one think of
this

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
cocaine is always cocaine and it
 
00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
combines it's
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
cut with different substances or
 
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
products and things are added to it
 
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
but ultimately the main ingredient is
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
always the main ingredient
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
with synthetic drugs it's more of a
 
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
chemical situation so the problem is
 
00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
you can define a synthetic drug but
 
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
if you change some minor ingredients
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's no longer a fixed definition or
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
it's hard to prove if it's the
 
00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:46.710 align:start position:0%
it's hard to prove if it's the
definition

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
definition
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
of the synthetic drug my understanding
 
00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
the intent of senate bill 34
 
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
is to really tighten up the definition
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
of synthetic drugs
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
which would make it easier to enforce
 
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
those laws
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
because the burden of proof on the state
 
00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 align:start position:0%
is very difficult if
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
you add salt or whatever you you add
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
some some parts to it
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
and change the whole ingredient so it
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
would make it easier to improve
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
so that's really the intent of the bill
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
did i i know it obviously passed in the
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
senate it's a senate bill i think it
 
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
passed 23 to
 
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
and i'm not allowed to make a motion but
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
if i was i would probably
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:35.519 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes you recognized
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
i'll make a motion ought to pass for
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
house bill 34
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
second do you mean senator 34
 
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
i have one question i hate to be a pain
 
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.230 align:start position:0%
i have one question i hate to be a pain
it's

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
representing fine night you were
 
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um i know one of our questions
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh was would this affect the private
 
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.070 align:start position:0%
uh was would this affect the private
sale

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
sale
 
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
for anyone trying to protect like their
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
garden or their farm or anything like i
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
know that was discussed can
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any more information
 
00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
on that this
 
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
as i understood it this bill wouldn't
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
change the right
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
for a consumer to to purchase synthetic
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
my understanding it's just me
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
that under the current law it is illegal
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
to manufacture
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
distribute or in any way
 
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
use synthetic urine uh my understanding
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
the senate bill could pass although it
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
repeals that section
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
it would remain it would all continue to
 
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:04.389 align:start position:0%
it would remain it would all continue to
be

00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
illegal to manufacture possess or
 
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise use
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
synthetic urine and that is that has
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
been a problem
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
in the past it's not as widely talked
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
about but is
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
it's often used to manipulate drug tests
 
00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
or try to
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
pass a drug test so there is a market
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative hopper you're recognized
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you mr chairman
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
i'm not all that opposed to uh the first
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
part of this
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh bill about the uh trying to uh
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
clarify what
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
synthetic drugs are but i am uh
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
adamantly opposed to lumping bills
 
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.150 align:start position:0%
adamantly opposed to lumping bills
together

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
by the senate um i think it denies
 
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
people what is one of the hallmarks of
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
the new
 
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
legislature is access the ability for
 
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:57.750 align:start position:0%
legislature is access the ability for
anybody

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
to look at a bill and and comment or
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
send a letter to the legislator
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
by lumping bills together there are
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
bills that are going uh being
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
passed or failed under the wire that the
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
public has no awareness of
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
because it was part of an ominous uh
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
bill in the senate
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
so i i'm going to vote against this uh
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
on principle
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
i think represent hopper is is senate
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
bill 34
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
actually an ominous bill it has two
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
separate fields but
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative you were recognized thank
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman i
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if somebody can answer this
 
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.110 align:start position:0%
don't know if somebody can answer this
but

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
i believe hunters use
 
00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
synthetic urine
 
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.350 align:start position:0%
synthetic urine
[Music]

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
for hunting purposes so what will this
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
do well
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
for you what you're talking about is not
 
00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.829 align:start position:0%
for you what you're talking about is not
human

00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
human
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
synthetic hearing so you i think what
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
you want to do is look at the definition
 
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
of synthetic urine i think it's listen
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
any using any substance or any product
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
if you go to any lighting store
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
right they have they sell products and
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
if you were to take that product
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
you would clean out your system to the
 
00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:19.839 align:start position:0%
point that you would at least not test
 
00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:20.550 align:start position:0%
point that you would at least not test
positive

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
positive
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
for any controlled substance all right
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
now if you go to the store and
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
at the vitamin store or whatever and you
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
say i need to
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
buy this because i need to pass a drug
 
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.590 align:start position:0%
buy this because i need to pass a drug
test

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
test
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
that's against the law they actually are
 
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
not allowed to sell you the
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
material anymore even though it's legal
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
for the next person how do you buy it
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
because they're not buying for that
 
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.710 align:start position:0%
because they're not buying for that
purpose

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
if the price if the merchant knows what
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to use it for the
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
manipulate drug test it makes it illegal
 
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
so it's i mean for the people most
 
00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:50.389 align:start position:0%
so it's i mean for the people most
people

00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
sadly most people know how to get around
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
that by not saying that whether
 
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:59.190 --> 00:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
i don't believe god using synthetic
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
journal purposes
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
people buy this bill and to the extent
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
that it would it's already illegal
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
on the parallel it's simply striking the
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
section and replacing it
 
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
which seems counterproductive but that's
 
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative wallace um
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
we all know this is all based upon
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
intent what's the intent of the
 
00:13:26.079 --> 00:13:26.949 align:start position:0%
intent what's the intent of the
legislator

00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
of the legislature what's the intent of
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
the actor and what are we doing
 
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:49.839 align:start position:0%
but if we say synthetic human urine
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
that will protect the hunters i can
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
believe because that gives you synthetic
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
gear urine
 
00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
and things like that uh to hide the
 
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
human scent so you're more
 
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
you look for a chapter i can imagine
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
there's a definition section
 
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
of chapter well it's bringing a new one
 
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:08.790 align:start position:0%
of chapter well it's bringing a new one
but

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
i dig into the existing wall it should

00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
that's what i was suggesting was yeah if
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
you use the
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
synthetic urine i guess if you're using
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
it for hunting purposes what it means it
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
would be a lawful use
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
similar to that of the stuff you buy the
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
vitamin shop you know you can
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
use it to cleanse your system there's a
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
lot of health benefits of cleansing your
 
00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:13.749 align:start position:0%

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
probably not doing it to manipulate drug
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
or alcohol screening it's legal
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
some people walk in the store and they
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
can't find it that's how they ask to
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
find it
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
hence they can't get the sale same thing
 
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.230 align:start position:0%
hence they can't get the sale same thing

you recognize her question
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman i just wanted
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
to state
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
that i believe that if the hunters
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
would be affected by this they would
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
have come out of force
 
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:11.950 align:start position:0%

representative klein knight you'll
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
recognize her great question
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman i think that um it's
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
good to question these bills because
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
we've seen a lot of poorly written
 
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
things come from the senate recently
 
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
so um you know asking the right
 
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:35.990 align:start position:0%
so um you know asking the right
questions

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
it it can be better for our people
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
just try lightly when we're speaking
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
about the other body
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you no need to throw comments
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
great okay so um i disagree with what
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
representative pandalaka said then i'll
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
just leave it at that
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
the fact that there are hunters the fact
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
that there are gardeners
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people that use this we
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
didn't get any data that says how many
 
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:03.510 align:start position:0%
didn't get any data that says how many
people

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
are using uh fake urine illegally
 
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
um i also want to know the sign in
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
numbers if representative muse can give
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
well well representative is looking for
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
that i will tell you that using
 
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
synthetic urine
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
today is also a crime so it's not like
 
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
we're creating
 
00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:26.799 align:start position:0%
a new crime it's not something that's
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
legal today that becomes legal tomorrow
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
so i i i certainly don't think we should
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
if we don't pass this bill
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
we ipl centerfield 34 the
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
market for synthetic urine will still be
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
just as illegal today as it is
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
tomorrow are you talking about synthetic
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
human urine or synthetic animal urine
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
because that's not clear in this
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
and that's what people use legally well
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
what i explained was
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
if you look on page two right i provide
 
00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:55.039 align:start position:0%
line numbers it explains
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
h2 lines 28 to 30 because if you're
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
it has to do when you're using it to a
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
human's using synthetic urine to
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
be a drug test so if you're selling
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
someone synthetic urine in the
 
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
with the knowing that they're going to
 
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
use it to manipulate the results of a
 
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
drug test
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
that is a crime if you're married i want
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
to know if it's already legal to
 
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:23.990 align:start position:0%
to know if it's already legal to
manipulate

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
manipulate
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
a drug test i think this is unnecessary
 
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.909 align:start position:0%
a drug test i think this is unnecessary
well

00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
i may agree with you that but what this
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
bill did was strike the existing section
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
and basically cut and paste and re-put
 
00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:35.110 align:start position:0%
and basically cut and paste and re-put
the

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
same section back in the wall i didn't
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
ask the senate why they chose to do that
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
but it seemed to be rather circular but
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
i could imagine it's
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
just that's sometimes easier to say
 
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
if you amend or a whole section
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's easier just to have
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
have the whole thing redone rather than
 
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.830 align:start position:0%
have the whole thing redone rather than
remodel

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
remodel
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
they don't know doesn't mean they don't
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
have anything in common from the last
 
00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:12.630 align:start position:0%
have anything in common from the last
option

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
and just the members participating at
 
00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:15.909 align:start position:0%
and just the members participating at
home

00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
just a reminder once the matter is put
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
to questions
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
as soon as i say the matter will now be
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
put to question
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
if you are not in your seat you will not
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
be permitted to vote
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
if you are participating remotely uh if
 
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
your camera is not on
 
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
when the matter is put to question you
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
will be ruled by the chair to not be in
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
your seat
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh so i do recommend uh if possible that
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
people uh
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
the members participating remotely try
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
to keep their cameras on
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
i would try and remind you to remind
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
everyone but if i don't it's what it is
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
sign ins on sb 34 um there were six
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
people who signed in
 
00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559 align:start position:0%
in support and two people who signed in
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
in opposition
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
seeing no further hands raised the
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
matter will now be put
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
right in time represent them seeing no
 
00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:11.919 align:start position:0%
further hands raise the matter will now
 
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:12.980 align:start position:0%
be put to question

is graciously handing out the amendment
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
it's member number 2021-1357h
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.590 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
mr chairman can you tell me the
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
amendment number again please
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
still kindly handing that out also there
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
was a similar house bill
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
that we passed that was hp 485
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
um although i did i did like that though
 
00:25:17.679 --> 00:25:18.470 align:start position:0%
um although i did i did like that though
better

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
uh if that bill has been retained by the
 
00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:21.909 align:start position:0%
uh if that bill has been retained by the
center

00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
center
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
so i i don't think we should let that
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily interfere what we want to do
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
but just to keep that in mind anyone
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
but uh at this time the channel
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative testing to
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
make the most of ought to pass off the
 
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.310 align:start position:0%
make the most of ought to pass off the
web

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
i'd like to make a uh pass on senate
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
bill 40
 
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh with an amendment and is that going
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
a second of the purposes of discussion
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
that has been that has been segmented by
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
of the uh representative you were
 
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak on the amendment
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment was it was one that my
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh chief of police asked me to
 
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
submit uh he agrees with the rest of the
 
00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.549 align:start position:0%
submit uh he agrees with the rest of the
bill

00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
he just wants to make sure that if
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
they're walking around the car let's say
 
00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
and they happen to see something in the
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
back seat
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
that they can you know
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
conduct a search and so all he did was
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
add the word
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
solely in the uh phrase it says
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
cannot be fairly further detained solely
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
for refusing
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
because there's something new that's
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
that's different
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
so that's all this amendment does
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
and if i recall the testimony correctly
 
00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:54.680 align:start position:0%
and because it's why
 
00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.789 align:start position:0%
and because it's why
[Music]

00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
this this concept whether it's a senator
 
00:26:59.360 --> 00:26:59.990 align:start position:0%
this this concept whether it's a senator
40

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
40
 
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
hp 45 it's it's it's new
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
so there isn't really any any case or
 
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
guidance on
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
how to proceed often
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
when we have search and procedure law
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's all
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
been established over generations of
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
case law and
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
up and down the left this is really a
 
00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.510 align:start position:0%
up and down the left this is really a
new

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
process so although the word adding the
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
word solely i thought
 
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
i didn't interpret it as a necessary
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
word it certainly does provide an extra
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
layer of clarification
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
and the idea from when i spoke with some
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
police officers the reason why they
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
support adding that language
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
is to avoid potential unnecessary
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
litigation down the line
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
by clarifying you know i found it to be
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
clear already
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
i don't find any problem overkill here
 
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
just to make sure it's
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
certainly what the intent of that
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
section is
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
so if you support the underlying bill i
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
don't see any
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
problem with the amendment it's not
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
changing the
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill it's really not
 
00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
changing how the bill would operate it's
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
just literally
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
clarifying what it was initially
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you we did hear during the um
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh during the public hearing from the
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
aclu and also from attorney cher
 
00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799 align:start position:0%
um and both objected to the addition of
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
the word
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh solely um uh
 
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
the testimony from uh attorney share was
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
that in his opinion
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh hb 40 is well well worded as it uh as
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
it stands
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
um and i think some of the concern was
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
that if you actually add the word
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
uh solely refusing to consent to the
 
00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:47.190 align:start position:0%
uh solely refusing to consent to the
search

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
search
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
uh itself would provide a reason to
 
00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:50.559 align:start position:0%
detain the person
 
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
in and of itself so what it essentially
 
00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
would do is change
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
the uh the meaning of the uh the meaning
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
of the statute and
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh and really it would affect the
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
representative testified to respond to
 
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
the jesus comment
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
yeah i i have a problem with bud
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
and the aclu continuing to victimize or
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
everybody and i do
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that they're
 
00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
well versed in everything but i
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
just i just disagree with their
 
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
and just to touch on that if you go to
 
00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.070 align:start position:0%
and just to touch on that if you go to
the

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
first page of the bill and we're a lot
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
this is line 12. in line
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
12 edgard says the operator cannot be
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
further detained
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
for refusing to consent to a search
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
this says the offer cannot be further
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
detained solely
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
for refusing to consent to research
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
so they're saying that i'm reading that
 
00:30:10.799 --> 00:30:11.269 align:start position:0%
so they're saying that i'm reading that
to

00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
say that if by you refusing to be
 
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.110 align:start position:0%
say that if by you refusing to be
consent

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
just like if you refuse to answer on
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
police officers questions that
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
in and of itself cannot be used to
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
establish probable cause or detain you
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
for any reason
 
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
now they're saying if you're this ain't
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
solely for refusing it's just
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
emphasizing if you're just
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
opposing or objecting to being searched
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
for that reason that reason is the
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
police cannot
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
detain it this to me it actually narrows
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
the scope
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh but at the same time this is how law
 
00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:45.830 align:start position:0%
uh but at the same time this is how law
enforcement

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
they wanted to be as specific as
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
possible state and comply
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
this is not expanding what they can do
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
it's actually narrowing it
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
considering it's coming from police
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
officers uh
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
who actually put in this suggestion it
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
was refreshing to actually uh
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
have that but i i just hear it for
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
coming they want to do it right
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
so i i don't think this creates any
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
confusion i understand that
 
00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
some people are objecting to it in their
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
testimony saying was a bad idea
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
i think if we could see any build if we
 
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
can clarify language we should do that
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure it's applied correctly
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to what law
 
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement candy can't do
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh i i support the amendment i don't
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
again i don't think
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
i i think the bill i would support build
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative harry jeffrey you're
 
00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:44.710 align:start position:0%
representative harry jeffrey you're
recognized

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
yes i remember the testimony well and i
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
am not for that amendment
 
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
and i too felt that the solely does not
 
00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.590 align:start position:0%
and i too felt that the solely does not
clarify

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's the word the verbiage that's on the
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
is clear it's very clear so i would not
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
be supporting
 
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
representative i represent raining would
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
you recognize
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair just i also agree
 
00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:17.269 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair just i also agree
with

00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh what the ranking member just said
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering about the word solely do
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
you need two things
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
to meet the fact that you can't be
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
further charged
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
i think solely depending on how you
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
define that word could make it more
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
so there's it's somewhat of an objective
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
balancing test from when someone can and
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
can't be retained
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
i've detained and
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
what this is saying is you can't take
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
into consideration
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
if all you have is several factors but
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
if all you have is
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
the fact that the person is uh objecting
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
to the search
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
that fact may not be the only factor you
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
you detain the person now
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
by saying the word solely it's saying
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
that you if you only have that
 
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
if you get rid of the word solely it
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's saying it can be part of other
 
00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:18.870 align:start position:0%
it's saying it can be part of other
stuff

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
or perhaps you can rely solely on just
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
the fact that personal objectives so
 
00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.750 align:start position:0%
the fact that personal objectives so
again

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
i don't think i i don't think it's
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
confusing at all and i'm
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
i think this this provides clarification
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
and if you heard the testimony this is
 
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.190 align:start position:0%
and if you heard the testimony this is
what

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
they the intended the bill was and i
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
think it was
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
great the law enforcement wants that
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
that's just me i i don't understand why
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
why it would create
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
people by adding that i'm surprised
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
people object to it
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
i think the bill is fine without it as
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
well so it's not it's not
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
i would hope that people wouldn't vote
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
against the ought to pass with the
 
00:33:57.919 --> 00:33:59.909 align:start position:0%
against the ought to pass with the
americans

00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
americans
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight you're
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you chair i would have
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
really liked to
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
see um police officers show up and
 
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:08.869 align:start position:0%
see um police officers show up and
testify

00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
that they wanted an amendment like this
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
and speak to all of us and not just one
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
representative so we could have
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
gotten a more clear understanding of the
 
00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.669 align:start position:0%
gotten a more clear understanding of the
intent

00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
intent
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
and i also again asked to be treated
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
the same as my colleagues across the
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
aisle i think that
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
saying i don't trust the um
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
organization that made a comment on this
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
and saying generalizing that they
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
all tend to victimize everybody is way
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
worse than the comment i made earlier so
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
i just want to point that out
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
when i say i don't trust a bill because
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
we've been getting a lot of bad
 
00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:58.690 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:00.950 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
all right and if something comes from
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
there that's not written
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
the way we would have written it and we
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
put an amendment then
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
there's no need to offer criticism i and
 
00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:14.839 align:start position:0%
i address that reason not to vote for it
 
00:35:14.839 --> 00:35:18.550 align:start position:0%
i address that reason not to vote for it
represented

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
you are not recognized to speak at this
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
time if this continues and you know the
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
rules by now
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
i will ask i'm going to have to ask you
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
to be removed from the room well
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
you're not in the room but you know what
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
i mean so please
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
just let we are not talking over each
 
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:34.550 align:start position:0%
just let we are not talking over each
other

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
it does not it does not need to be
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's been incurred uh whether we want
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
to concur with it with the senate or if
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
you want to
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
disagree with that there's a lot of
 
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
things we have to do today and if you
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%

the house by now and i'm sure i've
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
explained to you enough times do you
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
understand if you can't just yell out a
 
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.990 align:start position:0%
understand if you can't just yell out a
term

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
all i'm saying is in any comments about
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
the other organizations
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
if i miss that i'm i'm i accept my
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
apology i'm not perfect
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
all right but we don't need to be doing
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
that it's not a healthy way to start the
 
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:13.829 align:start position:0%
that it's not a healthy way to start the
day

00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
so i would ask that we don't criticize
 
00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:16.870 align:start position:0%
so i would ask that we don't criticize
anyone

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
period whether it's an organization the
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
other body
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
and that's it all right that's my
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
decision i want to talk about any
 
00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
further if you bring it up i'm going to
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
give you out of order because that's not
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
what you're recognized to do
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
if you want to provide critiques i'm
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
sure you'll do it on your twitter
 
00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.910 align:start position:0%
sure you'll do it on your twitter
account

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak the amendment i will
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
recognize you to speak to your amendment
 
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
by excluding the representative
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative ray newman you were
 
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:59.349 align:start position:0%
representative ray newman you were
recognized

00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i agree with your
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
ruling previously about dissent and the
 
00:37:06.839 --> 00:37:08.310 align:start position:0%
ruling previously about dissent and the
way

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
um and i think all should take into
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
consideration that we
 
00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
not should not challenge motivation
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
either of other representatives or
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
of organizations um i just think that's
 
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.670 align:start position:0%
of organizations um i just think that's
increase

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
i think that you're right uh sometimes
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
the emotions get to a high pitch in this
 
00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.589 align:start position:0%
the emotions get to a high pitch in this
committee

00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
and i guess that at my reading of when
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
the chair says
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
you are out of here or you're not that
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
the requirement for the
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
individual is to stop speaking until the
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
speaker is finished
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
and then if they have a comment with
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
that afterwards
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's the way i would consider to be
 
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:46.950 align:start position:0%
that's the way i would consider to be
right

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative and
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%

holding the whole on every committee uh
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify i i understand that
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
there was a comment that if the
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
any this was an amendment that was
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
supported by some members of law
 
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:02.960 align:start position:0%

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%

we had we had three members that did not

have their cameras on
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
the lever of the those three members as
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
i said
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
and i announced this rule beginning um
 
00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
those votes should not be counted
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
because they're not considered in their
 
00:41:50.319 --> 00:41:50.710 align:start position:0%
because they're not considered in their
seat

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
seat
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
representative you've raised the point
 
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
of order and that that was my point of
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
view mr chair that
 
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
there were people right in their seat
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
that everyone was logged in was going
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
i believe i believe the procedure is to
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
call the name
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
which they were called by the vote
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
should not be
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
recorded for those people who were not
 
00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
in their seat
 
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
understood i i and i
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
i agree with that 100 and that that
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
would be how the chairman would rule
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
with them
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
may i ask a question of the chair
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
we're still let me let the clerk
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
announce the the results of the vote
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
and then you're you can ask
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
well recognize you ask a question
 
00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:40.230 align:start position:0%
well recognize you ask a question
thereafter

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
mr chairman the vote would then be 11
 
00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:43.430 align:start position:0%
mr chairman the vote would then be 11
yay

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
yay
 
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:49.510 align:start position:0%
yay
7a

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
by votes of 11 years and seven nays the
 
00:42:58.109 --> 00:42:58.119 align:start position:0%

00:42:58.119 --> 00:43:00.550 align:start position:0%
motion to adopt amendment two zero
2021-13578

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
2021-13578
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
point of order representative calling
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
you recognized for point warner
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
who are the members whose votes were
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
just stripped from that tally
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't use the word script i don't
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
think any members votes were stripped
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
so i think you're asking which members
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
votes are not because they're not in
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
their seat when the matter was put to
 
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
question which i give that warning so
 
00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:30.150 align:start position:0%
question which i give that warning so
often

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
and i even paused letting them go but we
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
have a lot to do today
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
and trying to keep it moving here
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
i respect that but that was never
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
clarified we had a vote count that was
 
00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.470 align:start position:0%
clarified we had a vote count that was
different

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
from the result that was given so that's
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
the number i'm after right now
 
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
well the rule is and we've we've gone
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
through this before
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
you have to actually i can tell you that
 
00:43:55.349 --> 00:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
the members that
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
i actually have the court read it off
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
but right now
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
even if the member is appears in their
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
seat even though they're not in their
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
seat when the
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
matter is put to question the name of
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
the member is still
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
called so that was the we had that
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
incident before we remember it was not
 
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
in their seat that time the camera was
 
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:12.870 align:start position:0%
in their seat that time the camera was
on

00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
it was just an empty chair on the video
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
and they came in the middle of the vote
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
but in that in that case there was some
 
00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
instant issue because that member's name
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
was not called this time the members
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
names would still be called so they're
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
not being stripped which is
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
that's how the rule was explained to me
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
by the clerk and that's the rule that's
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
followed in every committee
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
if the if the clerk can you read the
 
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
names of the members that were not
 
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
i do not have any cameras on yes thank
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative ray newman representative
 
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
klein knight and
 
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding is i was so to call the
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
name so that that is what i did
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
i i understand that to be the correct
 
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.309 align:start position:0%
i i understand that to be the correct
procedure

00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
representative gatherer you're right mr
 
00:44:56.319 --> 00:44:57.510 align:start position:0%
representative gatherer you're right mr
chairman

00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
may i ask the question of the chair well
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
there's a point of order in that sense
 
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
supersede uh everything so
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative newman is the point of
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
ordering which to be recognized for
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
line of order when you said the word
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
mention my my camera was on
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
invisible at least on my computer and i
 
00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
was representative wallace's name one of
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
the persons is that
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
correct or incorrect i didn't get the
 
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
three of them so
 
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative wallace's camera may or
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
may not be on from time to time
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
it was not nate red but represented
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
walls is physically in the room
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
and i can see him physically in his
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
chair when the matter is put to question
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
if you are physically in the room you
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
have to be in your chair that's the
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
why we it's important that members stay
 
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.030 align:start position:0%
why we it's important that members stay
in

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
something we talked about in this room
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
representative green you can relate to
 
00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:47.270 align:start position:0%
representative green you can relate to
this

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
some people want me he just eats around
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
and the reason why people
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
have to be in your assigned seat when
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
the matter is put to question
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
this is something we've gone over that's
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
that is the ruling of the chair if and
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's it i've made my ruling
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
from what is visible in the room i
 
00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:15.030 align:start position:0%
from what is visible in the room i
recommend

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
that we're in the executive session
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
forever to leave their cameras on so
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
there's no misunderstanding
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
and that is it and that's the ruling of
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
the chair and i've
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
made the ruling i think i made it twice
 
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.230 align:start position:0%
made the ruling i think i made it twice
now

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
so as you can tell i'm unlikely to
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
change my mind so i'm only going to
 
00:46:29.599 --> 00:46:30.390 align:start position:0%
change my mind so i'm only going to
recognize

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
never to discuss whether the motion on
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
the floor i'm
 
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
going to recognize the representative
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
testament to make the most about the
 
00:46:37.119 --> 00:46:37.990 align:start position:0%
testament to make the most about the
pass

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
as amended make a motion out to pass
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
as amended for senate bill 40. and that
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
that motion has been seconded by
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative walls if a member wishes
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
about motion on the floor on excuse me
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's presented right now a lot the
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
past has amended who sucked it
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative wallace oh sorry thank
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative true you're recognized a
 
00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:14.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
of the vote on the amendment if i recall
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
correctly it was a vote by 11
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
to 7 in support of adopting the event
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
eleven years seven days
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative uh harriet gaffrey you
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
were recognized
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
um i just want you to know that i do
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
object to it okay
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
um i i really feel as though um
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
we're kind of like we're going overboard
 
00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
it's rule 107 of house rules and
 
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
i emphasize that i don't have much
 
00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
discretion with that
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
uh that's what the rule is if i didn't
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
enforce it it made
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
exceptions i don't think that would
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
serve as well i really wish
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
and i understand that people object at
 
00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:08.530 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:10.390 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
it passed by 11 years so if you count
 
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
those three votes anyway
 
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:16.559 align:start position:0%
it's not going to change the outcome but
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
i really think this is formal
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
substance at this point i'm only
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
recognizing people to speak
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
on the motion of octopasis amendment all
 
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:24.790 align:start position:0%
on the motion of octopasis amendment all
right

00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
the chairs made that ruling i'm not
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
going to change my role i'm not going to
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
overwhelm myself i've made it
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's it so i wish we could move on
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
with what i would say
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
a bill that we well hb45 we could not be
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
passed on consent
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
and i really hope that we pass senate
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
bill for your consent with or without
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
said amendments
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative panthelockus you're
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
recognized i just want to
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
say i'm gonna vote for the bill but i
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
think we need
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
to understand that everyone
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
in that room has to be in their seat
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
so it should be that they have to have
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
the cameras
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
as well representative pandermakis i'm
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
on your side with that
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
and uh i won't just say just for
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
clarification that not every member in
 
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
the room has a computer
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so that's part of the
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
just i'm just saying that for just the
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
you have to be in your seat when you
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
take a vote
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
or it does not count right in that room
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
who beat mr death correct i i
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight you're
 
00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.710 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight you're
recognized

00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm allowed to vote on this because
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
my camera's on the overall bill but even
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
though i wasn't allowed to vote on the
 
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
amendment even though when you said
 
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
three people don't have their cameras on
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
i immediately turned it on that wasn't
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
a notice to turn my camera on i'm very
 
00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:09.190 align:start position:0%
a notice to turn my camera on i'm very
confused

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
because i immediately turned my camera
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
on and i have enough i have a follow-up
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
question before you meet me
 
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
if we go back to youtube and it shows
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
that my camera was on time of vote are
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
you going are we going to be
 
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
like update anything or like if i have
 
00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:23.430 align:start position:0%
like update anything or like if i have
evidence

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
that shows my camera was on
 
00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:30.079 align:start position:0%
let me explain the rules of tier at this
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
moment in time that's that would take
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
about 10 minutes
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
but i think in what okay then just
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
keep going i think from what you said
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
though you admitted that your camera
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't on
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
when the matter was put to question so i
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
think it's pretty clear in the rules
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
and i mean i will say i did explain it
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
before we start
 
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to move i'm going to do at
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
i'm going to move the question the
 
00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
matter is now will be put to question
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
the motion is ought to pass as amended
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
point of order we're in the voting mode
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
if you are not in support mr chairman
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
mr chairman you stated earlier that a
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
point of order supersedes everything
 
00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:14.790 align:start position:0%
point of order supersedes everything

00:54:22.839 --> 00:54:37.030 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
to indicate i my hand is raised and that
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
probably is why you asked me if i was
 
00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
opposed but
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
appropriately that's what we're supposed
 
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
to do is put our hand up in
 
00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:50.839 align:start position:0%
in the computer if we are remote is that
 
00:54:50.839 --> 00:54:53.349 align:start position:0%
in the computer if we are remote is that
correct

00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
it is easier for me to realize that
 
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
someone has a hand raised when they
 
00:54:59.349 --> 00:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
put a little digital hand up this little
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%

at the same time if you're just waving
 
00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
at the screen i
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
don't always know if you're waving what
 
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
you're doing and i might miss it
 
00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:15.230 align:start position:0%

here and
 
00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
this is really intended to lower the the
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
temperature to
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
to reduce the arguments is that my
 
00:55:40.319 --> 00:55:40.950 align:start position:0%
to reduce the arguments is that my
confusion

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
earlier was the fact that there are
 
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
people in the room who
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
are have they're represented
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
from our perspective as being remote
 
00:55:53.589 --> 00:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
that they are remote so number one could
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
you tell us
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
who on the people
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
that are remote in on
 
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
your side i think all of the democrats
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
are remote today
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative located in the room
 
00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh okay thank you and when we did the

uh okay thank you and when we did the
role

00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
role
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
start the meeting when i as we do i have
 
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
a they call it the chairman's script i
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
read all these similar piece of paper
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's probably the same script every time
 
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
when people answer they are present they
 
00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:23.270 align:start position:0%
when people answer they are present they
say

00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
present in the room so that's the only
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
times ready
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
to disclose who is present in the room
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
and who's not
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
if you are present in the room and this
 
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
has been the practice of releasing this
 
00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.589 align:start position:0%
has been the practice of releasing this
committee

00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%

person in their seat
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
and that's the best clarification of how
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
we're going forward
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%

um we have basically taken
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
most of what is in the original
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
122 as passed by the senate
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%

00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
i think that's it but
 
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
we basi have included uh the
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
section on uh
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
immunity to uh punishment for recording
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
medical needs for uh during a pr
 
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
by a prostitute
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
included the area for
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%

and uh included the uh i'll counsel
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
represents the chair inquires of a
 
00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:48.630 align:start position:0%
represents the chair inquires of a
question

00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
he passed a similar house bill uh
 
00:59:53.109 --> 00:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
offered certain types of immunity
 
00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
for uh situation human trafficking
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
is your amendment is it are we passing a
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
repetitive provision
 
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding is are you referring to
 
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
hb uh
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh 93 123.
 
01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
uh that that section was removed from
 
01:00:12.839 --> 01:00:17.510 align:start position:0%
uh that that section was removed from
122.

01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
that was my way of asking tell me the
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify what
 
01:00:31.109 --> 01:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
123 which we passed
 
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
in that according to the docket
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
and this is just what the docket says is
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
on the consent
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
calendar in the center so
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
it looks like that will find his way at
 
01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
least to
 
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
in all likelihood find its way to the
 
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.109 align:start position:0%
in all likelihood find its way to the
[Music]

01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
so just
 
01:01:00.549 --> 01:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
provide that information representative
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
tesla you recognize
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so i'm confused here i
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
this 122 was an omnibus
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
monster and
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%

01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
the message it's whether to adopt the
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
amendment okay that's the that's right
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
now so
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
all right and then the author pass
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
and if i may ask a question of um
 
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
do you recognize ask a question me or to
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative board all right
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
so as i'm looking at senate bill 122.
 
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
we left in section two three
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
and a half of five is that correct
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
that's correct and then so it replaces
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
the rest of the bill
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you it looks like it did more
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
striking than okay
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
so it's i don't know this is an official
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
term it's less of anonymous
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
i will say that it would be very if we
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
don't pass the amendment
 
01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
i i don't like the idea of passing the
 
01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.069 align:start position:0%
i i don't like the idea of passing the
bill

01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
simply because of hp 123 which i want i
 
01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:50.390 align:start position:0%
simply because of hp 123 which i want i
think

01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
that was on consent i think he was 19 to
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
2 in the room
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
way to try this again seeing no further
 
01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
hands raised
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative newman hey
 
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
i prefer to move the question is it
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's about procedure and voting and it
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
would help me
 
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
as we're about to vote so i'd like to be
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
able to ask my question about the
 
01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:42.710 align:start position:0%
able to ask my question about the
procedure

01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
well so i'm gonna move the question and
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
then we can
 
01:04:48.789 --> 01:04:48.799 align:start position:0%
i s i i witness you cast most of this
 
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
committee for the entire
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
term so i i think we'll be able to make
 
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
it through this one we'll just move the
 
01:04:53.839 --> 01:04:55.109 align:start position:0%
it through this one we'll just move the
questions

01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%

the question is whether to adopt
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
amendment two zero
 
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%

that have passed but the senate has made
some

01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
amendments to it and my understanding is
 
01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:06.950 align:start position:0%
amendments to it and my understanding is
that

01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
as the house we can either concur
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
or we can object so
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
one of those is uh
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:20.159 --> 01:11:23.910 align:start position:0%
 
375

01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:29.189 --> 01:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
by the chief of police in the in the
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
county sheriff's order
 
01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
we forgot to put the word sheriffs in
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
there is all what the senate did
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
i i didn't i understood when they said
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
police officers or police department
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
including the county sheriffs
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh whether i am right or wrong with that
 
01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
all the
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
senate amendment did was include
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
sheriffs in that so
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
if this passed i believe some consent
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
that this doesn't change this actually
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
improves the intent of the bill
 
01:12:04.709 --> 01:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
does anyone on this committee have any
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
objection with allowing the sheriffs to
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
enjoy the same luxury as the
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
state and local police officers when it
 
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
i have no problem i can't i didn't think
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
there would be a problem but
 
01:12:23.189 --> 01:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
we never never know
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
so i i would encourage us to concur with
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
the senate on that
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
amendment the house bill who's on the
 
01:12:30.239 --> 01:12:34.830 align:start position:0%
amendment the house bill who's on the
driver

01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:37.270 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
bill 239 relative to the prosecution of
 
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
certain assaults against minus
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
in the house and i'll tell you right now
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
what they did was it what the bill had
 
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
done it was
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
extending the stature limitation of six
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
years within the victim's 18th birthday
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
the senate did not agree with the six
 
01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
years they made an amendment to
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
three years and if anyone has any
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
comments on that i i like the six years
 
01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
i certainly wouldn't want to see the
 
01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:19.350 align:start position:0%
i certainly wouldn't want to see the
bill

01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
disappear because it's only three years
 
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
three is better than
 
01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
it's still an improvement to the
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
existing walk i don't have the
 
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
rationale for the center why they did
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
not like the six years
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative ray newman you're
 
01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:36.229 align:start position:0%
representative ray newman you're
recognized

01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair thank you i have a
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
parliamentary the
 
01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
the senate changed something in a house
 
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
bill and the house bill comes back
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
i thought that came back to the full
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
house and not to the committee
 
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
is that incorrect no you are correct
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
okay you asked the question i was just
 
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
we're having we're having a very casual
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
discussion and the reason why is i like
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
to think that
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
because this bill came out of our
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
committee that we're all familiar with
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
and there's been some minor changes to
 
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
some of the provisions
 
01:14:11.669 --> 01:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
and yes but it goes to the full house
 
01:14:11.679 --> 01:14:13.430 align:start position:0%
and yes but it goes to the full house
but

01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
i've been it's been recommended that you
 
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
discuss it with the committee
 
01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
and that's what i'm doing allowing
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
everyone to voice their opinions on what
 
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
the senate has done with their
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
amendments to house bills that we passed
 
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
we obviously didn't pass that language
 
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
we didn't find that language necessary
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
but at the same time
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
i value everyone's opinion so
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
i i would i would appreciate everyone's
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
input with interesting representatives
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
as i'm trying to recognize the chair i
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
remember the bill
 
01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:43.810 align:start position:0%
at my age that's a good thing
 
01:14:43.810 --> 01:14:45.750 align:start position:0%
at my age that's a good thing
[Music]

01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
and it was something about the 18
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
the up to the age of 18 was something in
 
01:14:54.149 --> 01:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
our bill
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
our bill extended
 
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
to six years past 18 was was that our
 
01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:01.350 align:start position:0%
to six years past 18 was was that our
bill

01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
so the house bill version of the bill
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
sets the status limitations for first
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
and second
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
degree assault against buyers that's six
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
years from the victim's 18th birthday
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
so while the victim is a minor the
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations does not begin
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
to run so once they turn 18 it begins to
 
01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:20.149 align:start position:0%
to run so once they turn 18 it begins to
run

01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
run
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
the house bill would have made that a
 
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
six year national invitation now i
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
obviously had no problem with that but
 
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
the senate bill did
 
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
it limits it to three years from the
 
01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:31.830 align:start position:0%
it limits it to three years from the
victim's

01:15:31.830 --> 01:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
victim's
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
18th birthday representative
 
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
true you recognized thank you and
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
without knowing the reasons behind
 
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
the senate change um
 
01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
i would certainly think that would be
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
good when you go to a conference
 
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
i agree i like i personally i like the
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
six years better
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
i mean i think an 18 year old to the
 
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
point that 21 i mean
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
we're telling risk we passed laws and
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
that person came to buy cigarettes
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
so i i'm just looking at you know
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
talking about the maturity of the human
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
brain we've heard tests on all these
 
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
bills about all this stuff
 
01:16:15.669 --> 01:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
and this is someone who's been a victim
 
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
of a violent crime who's a minor
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
i don't see the harm making it six years
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
representative green you're recognized
 
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh what was the vote of the
 
01:16:30.149 --> 01:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
senate on that
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
from the amendment yes
 
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
why look that up representative bourdain
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
you're recognized
 
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh i can't agree with
 
01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:41.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh i can't agree with
this

01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
change i prefer that if we
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
do anything we have a committee of
 
01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:48.550 align:start position:0%
do anything we have a committee of
conference

01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
conference
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
and see if we can get the senate to come
 
01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.110 align:start position:0%
and see if we can get the senate to come
to

01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh agreement mr chairman it was 24
 
01:16:58.540 --> 01:16:58.550 align:start position:0%
yes zero no
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:17:00.709 align:start position:0%
yes zero no
[Music]

01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
oh representative uh please you're
 
01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:13.510 align:start position:0%
oh representative uh please you're
recognized

01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
so i just just wanted to remind members
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee that
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
we've had other bills that we've
 
01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:20.950 align:start position:0%
we've had other bills that we've
actually

01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
itl because we increased the statute of
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
limitations so long
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
that it created real doubts around
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not people
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
could be prosecuted whether witnesses
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
could be found whether
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
evidence would still uh uh
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
would actually still be viable um
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
you know to me uh six years seems to be
 
01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
a pretty reasonable measure given
 
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
especially given the fact where we are
 
01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:48.709 align:start position:0%
especially given the fact where we are
now

01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
um and uh i agree with representative
 
01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.510 align:start position:0%
um and uh i agree with representative
bordenay

01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
bordenay
 
01:17:59.430 --> 01:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not inclined to agree to this change
 
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
i i thank you representative i love it
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
but i love the unity on this one so
 
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
all right representative brandon when
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%

01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair since i was only

01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
all right what we're going to do now is
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%

01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
10 42 we are going to be uh in recess
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%

01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
11 30. if you're running your run late
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
but yes
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
we'll be at recess to 11 45.
 
02:27:04.950 --> 02:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:09.429 --> 02:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:12.710 --> 02:27:12.720 align:start position:0%

okay yes i text daryl he said 10 minutes
 
02:27:17.990 --> 02:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
he said soon
 
02:27:21.910 --> 02:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
so i said 5 10 and he typed 10.
 
02:27:23.750 --> 02:27:23.760 align:start position:0%

them okay
 
02:27:29.750 --> 02:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's fair to the
 
02:27:33.190 --> 02:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
feared to us i agree 100 yeah
 
02:27:36.150 --> 02:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
i agree 100 because he he should have
 
02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:36.469 align:start position:0%
i agree 100 because he he should have
just

02:27:36.469 --> 02:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:27:38.150 --> 02:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
texted and said we're going to be out
 
02:27:40.550 --> 02:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
another 15 minutes or so
 
02:27:44.150 --> 02:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
agreed i want everybody to remember this
 
02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:44.870 align:start position:0%
agreed i want everybody to remember this
is

02:27:44.870 --> 02:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
being recorded i'm okay with that we're
 
02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
not saying
 
02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
actually this is the perfect time for us
 
02:27:53.349 --> 02:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
to have public statements right now
 
02:27:55.590 --> 02:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
they left the room they left it
 
02:27:57.830 --> 02:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
recording the public has total access to
 
02:27:59.190 --> 02:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
what we're saying
 
02:28:02.790 --> 02:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
and i can go on the record saying i've
 
02:28:04.150 --> 02:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
been muted
 
02:28:07.590 --> 02:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
multiple occasions where it should be
 
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
fair and open discussions and even when
 
02:28:12.469 --> 02:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
you don't agree with somebody
 
02:28:13.670 --> 02:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think that should be a
 
02:28:15.910 --> 02:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
discussion that we should be having
 
02:28:18.710 --> 02:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
right now second session is meant an
 
02:28:21.590 --> 02:28:21.600 align:start position:0%

02:28:23.990 --> 02:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
well if i'm muted during executive
 
02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:25.270 align:start position:0%

02:28:52.840 --> 02:29:06.830 align:start position:0%

02:53:57.750 --> 02:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
i'll be voting against the motion of the
 
02:54:00.150 --> 02:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
expedition legislature
 
02:54:02.870 --> 02:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
for a few reasons one it was clear
 
02:54:05.110 --> 02:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
during the testimony that the
 
02:54:08.950 --> 02:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
state deadline seem to uh be
 
02:54:08.960 --> 02:54:10.150 align:start position:0%
state deadline seem to uh be
[Music]

02:54:10.150 --> 02:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:54:12.150 --> 02:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
getting their act together only because
 
02:54:13.910 --> 02:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
this bill was introduced
 
02:54:16.950 --> 02:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
which leads me to believe that once this
 
02:54:18.309 --> 02:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
bill is uh
 
02:54:21.190 --> 02:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
disposed of they couldn't go right back
 
02:54:22.950 --> 02:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
to what what they were doing
 
02:54:25.110 --> 02:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
it has also been brought to my attention
 
02:54:26.710 --> 02:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
that uh with new
 
02:54:29.429 --> 02:54:29.439 align:start position:0%
software they're using the new gun line
 
02:54:30.389 --> 02:54:30.399 align:start position:0%
it will
 
02:54:33.510 --> 02:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
amount to a de facto gun registration
 
02:54:35.750 --> 02:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
for everybody that buys a handgun
 
02:54:38.389 --> 02:54:38.399 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire for these
 
02:54:40.150 --> 02:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
and other reasons i
 
02:54:45.110 --> 02:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:47.670 --> 02:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and delocation

recognized
 
02:54:51.190 --> 02:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i believe this
 
02:54:53.110 --> 02:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
bill will put a burden
 
02:54:56.150 --> 02:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
on the taxpayers and i believe the state
 
02:54:56.160 --> 02:54:56.710 align:start position:0%
on the taxpayers and i believe the state
police

02:54:56.710 --> 02:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
police
 
02:54:59.910 --> 02:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
because it's been one little error but
 
02:55:00.630 --> 02:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:55:03.389 --> 02:55:03.399 align:start position:0%
it's done a good job since i've been in
 
02:55:03.399 --> 02:55:05.349 align:start position:0%

i'm going to vote in favor of icl
 
02:55:18.950 --> 02:55:18.960 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
02:55:28.630 --> 02:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
that does a lot for the folks who need a
 
02:55:30.469 --> 02:55:30.479 align:start position:0%
protective order
 
02:55:33.990 --> 02:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
the feds don't get that they don't have
 
02:55:35.030 --> 02:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
access to that
 
02:55:38.309 --> 02:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:41.110 --> 02:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
the gun line protects women in those
 
02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:42.630 align:start position:0%
the gun line protects women in those
circumstances

02:55:42.630 --> 02:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
02:55:44.150 --> 02:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
and it's mostly women who get their
 
02:55:51.429 --> 02:55:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:53.990 --> 02:55:54.000 align:start position:0%

02:56:03.590 --> 02:56:03.600 align:start position:0%

02:56:06.870 --> 02:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
to itl is a vote in favor of a wait
 
02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:08.230 align:start position:0%
to itl is a vote in favor of a wait
period

02:56:08.230 --> 02:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:56:13.830 --> 02:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
for gun buyers this is an anti-gun vote
 
02:56:16.790 --> 02:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
we had a tremendous amount of testimony
 
02:56:18.950 --> 02:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
from the gun organizations
 
02:56:23.830 --> 02:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
of gun groups store owners
 
02:56:26.309 --> 02:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
that were overwhelmingly in the public
 
02:56:27.590 --> 02:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
that were overwhelmingly
 
02:56:31.030 --> 02:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
in favor of senate bill 141. senate bill
 
02:56:31.040 --> 02:56:32.070 align:start position:0%
in favor of senate bill 141. senate bill

02:56:32.070 --> 02:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
141
 
02:56:35.110 --> 02:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
will solve a problem that has festered
 
02:56:38.150 --> 02:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
for decades so this is not
 
02:56:41.510 --> 02:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
something new
 
02:56:45.990 --> 02:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:47.750 --> 02:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
that the gun line was established could
 
02:56:51.110 --> 02:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
have been 98 but i believe 99.
 
02:56:54.150 --> 02:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
they have been okay
 
02:56:57.349 --> 02:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
at times in other times they've been
 
02:56:57.359 --> 02:57:00.309 align:start position:0%
at times in other times they've been
terrible

02:57:00.309 --> 02:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:04.710 --> 02:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
i talked to a few people that waited
 
02:57:07.190 --> 02:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
four weeks to eight weeks to get
 
02:57:08.630 --> 02:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
approved to buy
 
02:57:11.670 --> 02:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
a handgun in new hampshire and this was
 
02:57:14.309 --> 02:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
only about eight months ago
 
02:57:17.590 --> 02:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
have they improved it yes but there's
 
02:57:17.600 --> 02:57:18.150 align:start position:0%
have they improved it yes but there's
still

02:57:18.150 --> 02:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
still
 
02:57:21.349 --> 02:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:25.750 --> 02:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:28.150 --> 02:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
what they're doing now the state police
 
02:57:32.630 --> 02:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:34.870 --> 02:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
they don't answer their phone this is
 
02:57:36.070 --> 02:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
what the gun stores are telling
 
02:57:39.269 --> 02:57:39.279 align:start position:0%
me they're not answering for one to
 
02:57:40.710 --> 02:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
three hours
 
02:57:42.070 --> 02:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
then they'll answer the phone you know
 
02:57:43.429 --> 02:57:43.439 align:start position:0%
because they're next in line so they'll
 
02:57:44.630 --> 02:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
answer the phone
 
02:57:47.670 --> 02:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
and then what happens is they will do
 
02:57:48.710 --> 02:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
the background
 
02:57:51.830 --> 02:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
within four to ten minutes
 
02:57:53.429 --> 02:57:53.439 align:start position:0%
all right but you had to wait three
 
02:57:59.030 --> 02:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:02.710 --> 02:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
on the denial part it is easy
 
02:58:05.990 --> 02:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
to fix the denial part
 
02:58:08.710 --> 02:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
if you're denied for a wrong name in
 
02:58:11.030 --> 02:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
another state or even in the same state
 
02:58:12.870 --> 02:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
or a date of birth is an issue or
 
02:58:16.389 --> 02:58:16.399 align:start position:0%
something whatever the reason is
 
02:58:18.630 --> 02:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
you go on their website and you don't
 
02:58:21.349 --> 02:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
have to hire an attorney
 
02:58:22.790 --> 02:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
i've talked to people that have done
 
02:58:24.790 --> 02:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
this for something small
 
02:58:26.950 --> 02:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
and they've gone on there and they have
 
02:58:28.469 --> 02:58:28.479 align:start position:0%
fixed it within the
 
02:58:33.030 --> 02:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
time allotted the biggest thing that i
 
02:58:38.230 --> 02:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:42.070 --> 02:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
a long gun a rifle
 
02:58:45.349 --> 02:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
the store calls nicks
 
02:58:47.990 --> 02:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
directly it's approved or it's
 
02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:51.030 align:start position:0%
directly it's approved or it's
disapproved

02:58:51.030 --> 02:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:54.469 --> 02:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
a handgun the store calls the state
 
02:58:54.479 --> 02:58:56.630 align:start position:0%
a handgun the store calls the state
police

02:58:56.630 --> 02:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
police
 
02:58:59.990 --> 02:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
the state police by law federal
 
02:59:03.269 --> 02:59:03.279 align:start position:0%
law they have no choice about it they
 
02:59:06.790 --> 02:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
have to call next now when i say
 
02:59:10.230 --> 02:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
call it's through a computer so you know
 
02:59:11.910 --> 02:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
i'm 60 years old that's what i'm using
 
02:59:13.110 --> 02:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
is called
 
02:59:14.790 --> 02:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
but they do it through the computer they
 
02:59:16.710 --> 02:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
type it up get it out
 
02:59:19.670 --> 02:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
and they get a denial or they get an
 
02:59:19.680 --> 02:59:21.990 align:start position:0%
and they get a denial or they get an
acceptance

02:59:21.990 --> 02:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
acceptance
 
02:59:25.110 --> 02:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire state police has to
 
02:59:28.389 --> 02:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
follow what they say
 
02:59:31.429 --> 02:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
now what the state police also does for
 
02:59:32.630 --> 02:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
handguns only
 
02:59:33.830 --> 02:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
so if you want to buy a rifle you're
 
02:59:35.670 --> 02:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
going to get it in four to six minutes
 
02:59:35.680 --> 02:59:36.790 align:start position:0%
going to get it in four to six minutes
tops

02:59:36.790 --> 02:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
tops
 
02:59:38.630 --> 02:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
a handgun what the state police will
 
02:59:40.389 --> 02:59:40.399 align:start position:0%
also do is if they
 
02:59:42.790 --> 02:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
question the name and say okay he got
 
02:59:44.150 --> 02:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
accepted from the feds
 
02:59:45.910 --> 02:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
so technically they could call the gun
 
02:59:47.830 --> 02:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
store back and say yes the guys accept
 
02:59:47.840 --> 02:59:48.469 align:start position:0%
store back and say yes the guys accept
it

02:59:48.469 --> 02:59:48.479 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:59:51.590 --> 02:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
but they don't in some cases
 
02:59:53.110 --> 02:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
they'll start looking at the local
 
02:59:54.870 --> 02:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
courts they will
 
02:59:58.630 --> 02:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh fax the old paper way
 
03:00:01.349 --> 03:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
their local police and say hey we're
 
03:00:02.150 --> 03:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
just wondering
 
03:00:05.510 --> 03:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
how is this done that's
 
03:00:08.710 --> 03:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
a further weight it's not by law
 
03:00:10.950 --> 03:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
it's not my statute they're running
 
03:00:12.230 --> 03:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
rogue over there
 
03:00:15.590 --> 03:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
they do as they want and they're not
 
03:00:18.630 --> 03:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
following the law the law says abc
 
03:00:21.269 --> 03:00:21.279 align:start position:0%
will disqualify you or abc won't
 
03:00:22.469 --> 03:00:22.479 align:start position:0%
disqualify you
 
03:00:24.469 --> 03:00:24.479 align:start position:0%
they're going beyond that and they don't
 
03:00:26.230 --> 03:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
need to do that
 
03:00:30.230 --> 03:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
that's why passing or voting against
 
03:00:33.030 --> 03:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
this itl and supporting another motion
 
03:00:34.469 --> 03:00:34.479 align:start position:0%
that i would make
 
03:00:36.550 --> 03:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
um is the right thing to do because
 
03:00:38.469 --> 03:00:38.479 align:start position:0%
bottom line
 
03:00:41.670 --> 03:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
this is an anti-gun bill what this is is
 
03:00:42.950 --> 03:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
it is a vote
 
03:00:46.150 --> 03:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
to support a wait period if this bill
 
03:00:47.030 --> 03:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
goes down
 
03:00:50.230 --> 03:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
that's all this bill does is to keep
 
03:00:53.030 --> 03:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire state police in line
 
03:00:54.630 --> 03:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
with doing what they're doing
 
03:00:57.110 --> 03:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
which is causing new hampshire citizens
 
03:00:58.710 --> 03:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
to have a wait period
 
03:01:01.910 --> 03:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
to purchase their handguns from
 
03:01:05.990 --> 03:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
a ffl licensed dealer in new hampshire
 
03:01:09.349 --> 03:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
now the other thing too real quick is
 
03:01:14.150 --> 03:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
i was told uh by several gun stores
 
03:01:16.710 --> 03:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
when they had this long wait of the four
 
03:01:16.720 --> 03:01:17.590 align:start position:0%
when they had this long wait of the four
to

03:01:17.590 --> 03:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:01:20.150 --> 03:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
you know eight weeks and there was only
 
03:01:21.269 --> 03:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
a handful of people
 
03:01:23.990 --> 03:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
that had to wait six months just a
 
03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:25.030 align:start position:0%
that had to wait six months just a
handful

03:01:25.030 --> 03:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
handful
 
03:01:27.190 --> 03:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
but six months can you imagine that if
 
03:01:28.710 --> 03:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
you wanted a gun you had to wait six
 
03:01:28.720 --> 03:01:29.269 align:start position:0%
you wanted a gun you had to wait six
months

03:01:29.269 --> 03:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
months
 
03:01:31.269 --> 03:01:31.279 align:start position:0%
but most of it was four to eight weeks
 
03:01:34.230 --> 03:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
and this went on for months
 
03:01:36.630 --> 03:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
at shooter's outpost he told me
 
03:01:39.349 --> 03:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
personally when i visited
 
03:01:42.550 --> 03:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
that he had two over 2
 
03:01:47.429 --> 03:01:47.439 align:start position:0%
000 guns that were sold
 
03:01:52.150 --> 03:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
sitting in the back room waited
 
03:01:53.990 --> 03:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
the four to eight weeks to get a

background check done
 
03:01:57.349 --> 03:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
through new hampshire or through new
 
03:01:59.830 --> 03:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire state police
 
03:02:02.150 --> 03:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
that if he called nicks directly like a
 
03:02:02.160 --> 03:02:03.110 align:start position:0%
that if he called nicks directly like a
rifle

03:02:03.110 --> 03:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
rifle
 
03:02:04.790 --> 03:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
because some people bought a handgun and
 
03:02:06.870 --> 03:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
a rifle the same time
 
03:02:09.190 --> 03:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
they walked out with the rifle they had
 
03:02:11.830 --> 03:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
to sit and wait and wait and wait
 
03:02:15.830 --> 03:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
so can you imagine a small store
 
03:02:18.870 --> 03:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
with just 10 guns that's all they got
 
03:02:21.590 --> 03:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
10 guns sitting in the back i don't know
 
03:02:22.550 --> 03:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
what that price would be
 
03:02:24.070 --> 03:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
five eight thousand dollars that they're
 
03:02:26.389 --> 03:02:26.399 align:start position:0%
waiting on just sitting there
 
03:02:28.150 --> 03:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
that the store can't take that money and
 
03:02:29.590 --> 03:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
pay their employees in the light bill
 
03:02:30.070 --> 03:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
and everything
 
03:02:33.429 --> 03:02:33.439 align:start position:0%
else so they're stuck this
 
03:02:36.790 --> 03:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
is wrong it's anti-business and it's
 
03:02:38.710 --> 03:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
waiting for a yeah it's supporting a
 
03:02:41.030 --> 03:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
wait period so i hope you vote
 
03:02:44.230 --> 03:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
no like i'm going to because this is a
 
03:02:45.190 --> 03:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
wait period
 
03:02:47.030 --> 03:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
if it's good enough for the rifles to go
 
03:02:48.389 --> 03:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
to knicks straight
 
03:02:50.790 --> 03:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
in the three states around us because a
 
03:02:52.230 --> 03:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
lot of times we've talked
 
03:02:53.990 --> 03:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
oh we gotta be just like massachusetts
 
03:02:55.269 --> 03:02:55.279 align:start position:0%
vermont new york
 
03:02:59.510 --> 03:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
maine well if we join all them
 
03:03:01.349 --> 03:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent of their guns go to
 
03:03:04.150 --> 03:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
next and it's a system that works
 
03:03:07.349 --> 03:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
matter of fact my old state uh
 
03:03:08.870 --> 03:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
apparently i didn't buy any guns because
 
03:03:10.630 --> 03:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
it was short-lived during that period of
 
03:03:10.640 --> 03:03:11.670 align:start position:0%
it was short-lived during that period of
time

03:03:11.670 --> 03:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:03:15.110 --> 03:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
i i was told in early 90s they did go
 
03:03:18.469 --> 03:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
through the new you know their own
 
03:03:21.750 --> 03:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:24.230 --> 03:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
and it was costly they said why are we
 
03:03:27.030 --> 03:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
doing this it's a federal mandate
 
03:03:28.710 --> 03:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
it's real quick just to go through the
 
03:03:28.720 --> 03:03:30.469 align:start position:0%
it's real quick just to go through the
feds

03:03:30.469 --> 03:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
feds
 
03:03:32.950 --> 03:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
we allow rifles like new hampshire does
 
03:03:34.630 --> 03:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
yeah why don't we allow them to do the
 
03:03:35.830 --> 03:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
pistols too
 
03:03:37.590 --> 03:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
so that's what they're doing so the
 
03:03:39.510 --> 03:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
three states around us are doing that
 
03:03:43.110 --> 03:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
so again this is a wait period motion
 
03:03:45.670 --> 03:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
so if you support a wait period for gun
 
03:03:47.990 --> 03:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
buyers in new hampshire
 
03:03:50.630 --> 03:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
then support the itl and i'm not because
 
03:03:53.349 --> 03:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
i don't support a wait period for the
 
03:03:56.389 --> 03:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
gun buyers and i definitely support gun
 
03:03:59.750 --> 03:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
stores to not have to hold a gun
 
03:04:02.150 --> 03:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
for four to eight weeks while they're
 
03:04:03.269 --> 03:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
sitting on that money
 
03:04:06.070 --> 03:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
can't you know support their store thank
 
03:04:07.349 --> 03:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and i
 
03:04:13.010 --> 03:04:13.020 align:start position:0%

tesla
 
03:04:40.870 --> 03:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
i agree with uh representative byrd
 
03:04:43.030 --> 03:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
when he talks about you know we don't
 
03:04:43.040 --> 03:04:44.550 align:start position:0%
when he talks about you know we don't
need

03:04:44.550 --> 03:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
need
 
03:04:48.870 --> 03:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
a wait period uh for the uh
 
03:04:52.230 --> 03:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
people first seeing a firearm but
 
03:04:54.309 --> 03:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
i picked up and i don't know what the
 
03:04:57.110 --> 03:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
issue is the shooter's outpost
 
03:04:59.429 --> 03:04:59.439 align:start position:0%
because they're a big big business they
 
03:05:01.830 --> 03:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
they do an awful lot of cases
 
03:05:05.110 --> 03:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
but i have a friend who called me uh
 
03:05:08.230 --> 03:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
with and sent me statistics on
 
03:05:11.429 --> 03:05:11.439 align:start position:0%
the uh the delay or delays or
 
03:05:13.830 --> 03:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
how long it takes he keeps a spreadsheet
 
03:05:16.150 --> 03:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
of every phone call he's made he works
 
03:05:20.230 --> 03:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
friday saturday sunday at a gun store
 
03:05:23.269 --> 03:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
in amherst and uh
 
03:05:26.870 --> 03:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
he has no cases of uh
 
03:05:29.910 --> 03:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
having to dial numerous times after
 
03:05:29.920 --> 03:05:30.469 align:start position:0%
having to dial numerous times after
eight

03:05:30.469 --> 03:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
eight
 
03:05:34.389 --> 03:05:34.399 align:start position:0%
after early april after early april he
 
03:05:37.429 --> 03:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
his business as usual they're five i
 
03:05:39.750 --> 03:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
think about his 5.8 seconds or something
 
03:05:41.429 --> 03:05:41.439 align:start position:0%
like that
 
03:05:44.710 --> 03:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
from the time he calls until he's got an
 
03:05:44.720 --> 03:05:45.269 align:start position:0%
from the time he calls until he's got an
answer

03:05:45.269 --> 03:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
answer
 
03:05:47.670 --> 03:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
go ahead and sell the gun or don't
 
03:05:47.680 --> 03:05:49.590 align:start position:0%
go ahead and sell the gun or don't
celebrate

03:05:49.590 --> 03:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
celebrate
 
03:05:52.230 --> 03:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
prior to that he will admit you know he
 
03:05:52.240 --> 03:05:53.269 align:start position:0%
prior to that he will admit you know he
was

03:05:53.269 --> 03:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:05:55.190 --> 03:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
put online they weren't answering and so
 
03:05:57.110 --> 03:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
on you know
 
03:06:00.469 --> 03:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
in march and early april but after that
 
03:06:04.550 --> 03:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's been cleaned up now so i
 
03:06:07.910 --> 03:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
i'm believing that they can do it
 
03:06:10.950 --> 03:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
granted they know we're looking at them
 
03:06:14.469 --> 03:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
i have some difficulty with
 
03:06:16.870 --> 03:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
some of the gun groups who support this
 
03:06:19.190 --> 03:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
now and didn't support it later
 
03:06:22.150 --> 03:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
i also have some difficulty with i mean
 
03:06:23.670 --> 03:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
i am
 
03:06:26.790 --> 03:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
wavering but i'm going to vote itl
 
03:06:29.510 --> 03:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
because we have a company like microsoft
 
03:06:32.230 --> 03:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
we just signed a contract with
 
03:06:34.870 --> 03:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
with the uh the guideline to keep the
 
03:06:34.880 --> 03:06:35.429 align:start position:0%
with the uh the guideline to keep the
data

03:06:35.429 --> 03:06:35.439 align:start position:0%
data
 
03:06:39.429 --> 03:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
on the people so that said
 
03:06:49.590 --> 03:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:52.870 --> 03:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
see no further hands raised the matter
 
03:06:53.910 --> 03:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
went out
 
03:06:58.150 --> 03:06:58.160 align:start position:0%

03:09:56.840 --> 03:09:59.910 align:start position:0%
and there's going to be subcommittees
inside

03:09:59.910 --> 03:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:05.670 --> 03:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:07.510 --> 03:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
if anyone wishes to volunteer for the

03:10:17.910 --> 03:10:17.920 align:start position:0%

representative conley i believe you had
 
03:10:25.429 --> 03:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
an amendment for that bill
 
03:10:28.950 --> 03:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
so that bill the amended amendment that
 
03:10:31.750 --> 03:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
you have is actually part of senate bill
 
03:10:34.309 --> 03:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
96 which is not in our committee to the

people supposed to be
 
03:11:52.469 --> 03:11:52.479 align:start position:0%

03:11:53.510 --> 03:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's discretionary
 
03:11:56.710 --> 03:11:56.720 align:start position:0%

building

03:11:57.990 --> 03:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
building
 
03:12:00.229 --> 03:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
when we retained it we actually had not
 
03:12:01.990 --> 03:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
left our committee we would have been
 
03:12:04.550 --> 03:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
reconsidered and passed it i believe the
 
03:12:06.070 --> 03:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative conley had
 
03:12:08.150 --> 03:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
was something that was
 
03:12:10.550 --> 03:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
favorable by the majority of women
 
03:12:12.150 --> 03:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
favored by the majority committee
 
03:12:13.990 --> 03:12:14.000 align:start position:0%

03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:15.590 align:start position:0%
i'm a co-sponsor daniel i just think
that

03:12:15.590 --> 03:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:12:17.190 --> 03:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
it's in senate bill 96 i don't know
 
03:12:19.030 --> 03:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen to that but
 
03:12:20.710 --> 03:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
i believe the amendment whatever
 
03:12:22.229 --> 03:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
something we have i think representative
 
03:12:24.469 --> 03:12:24.479 align:start position:0%
paulie did all the work we need to do
 
03:12:27.510 --> 03:12:27.520 align:start position:0%

03:12:30.070 --> 03:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
it just we we can't do much on it but
 
03:12:30.950 --> 03:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to point
 
03:12:33.190 --> 03:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
up to me so let's be people to monitor
 
03:12:34.150 --> 03:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
03:12:35.830 --> 03:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure there's something we
 
03:12:37.349 --> 03:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
even have to meet it might
 
03:12:40.229 --> 03:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
it might work itself out and if
 
03:12:41.510 --> 03:12:41.520 align:start position:0%

03:12:50.950 --> 03:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
representative she wished to be on this
 
03:12:54.389 --> 03:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
on the subcommittee with the chair
 
03:12:58.830 --> 03:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:06.229 --> 03:13:06.239 align:start position:0%

03:13:31.830 --> 03:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:34.469 --> 03:13:34.479 align:start position:0%
so this is i mean so in regards to the
 
03:13:36.309 --> 03:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
relevant of legalization and regulation
 
03:13:37.590 --> 03:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
of cannabis and making
 
03:13:41.269 --> 03:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
appropriations there are therefore
 
03:13:43.830 --> 03:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
that subcommittee will be the same
 
03:13:43.840 --> 03:13:44.790 align:start position:0%
that subcommittee will be the same
subcommittee

03:13:44.790 --> 03:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
03:13:47.990 --> 03:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
for relative the home cultivation of
 
03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:48.630 align:start position:0%
for relative the home cultivation of
cannabis

03:13:48.630 --> 03:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
03:13:51.910 --> 03:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
plants uh in the possession of certain
 
03:13:53.670 --> 03:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
certain cannabis infused products
 
03:13:55.190 --> 03:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
although the employments will be made
 
03:13:55.200 --> 03:13:57.030 align:start position:0%
although the employments will be made
separately

03:13:57.030 --> 03:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
separately
 
03:13:58.630 --> 03:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
it's my intent for those to all be heard
 
03:14:00.710 --> 03:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
together about the same committee
 
03:14:01.910 --> 03:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
and really if we're going to put
 
03:14:03.030 --> 03:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
something out there should really just
 
03:14:04.229 --> 03:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
be one bill
 
03:14:08.630 --> 03:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully capturing positives of
 
03:14:10.150 --> 03:14:10.160 align:start position:0%

03:14:12.309 --> 03:14:12.319 align:start position:0%

and then reconsidered and passed on
 
03:26:35.760 --> 03:26:36.630 align:start position:0%
and then reconsidered and passed on
consent

03:26:36.630 --> 03:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
consent
 
03:26:38.950 --> 03:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
only to find out by the third that we
 
03:26:40.550 --> 03:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
could not have reconsidered the bill
 
03:26:43.510 --> 03:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
at least that was procedurally improper
 
03:26:45.349 --> 03:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
despite that being a tremendous show of
 
03:26:47.349 --> 03:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
unity amongst the committee
 
03:26:49.190 --> 03:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
i just don't feel i feel that we would
 
03:26:50.710 --> 03:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
pass this bill
 
03:26:52.790 --> 03:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
so when i say that we we can probably
 
03:26:54.469 --> 03:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
get away without appointing a
 
03:26:55.750 --> 03:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for this one
 
03:26:59.590 --> 03:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
we can what i will do just to make sure
 
03:27:01.269 --> 03:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
we don't forget about it in case we're
 
03:27:03.110 --> 03:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
all busy i'm just going to have a
 
03:27:04.870 --> 03:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
three-person subcommittee be appointed
 
03:27:06.389 --> 03:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
of myself
 
03:27:07.510 --> 03:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
our representative welsh and
 
03:27:09.670 --> 03:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
representative harry cavalry just to
 
03:27:10.870 --> 03:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that we don't forget about the
 
03:27:10.880 --> 03:27:12.229 align:start position:0%
make sure that we don't forget about the
bill

03:27:12.229 --> 03:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:27:14.790 --> 03:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
make sure he moves along but it would
 
03:27:14.800 --> 03:27:15.269 align:start position:0%
make sure he moves along but it would
have

03:27:15.269 --> 03:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:27:17.670 --> 03:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
passed our consent out of this committee
 
03:27:19.510 --> 03:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
had there not been a procedural wonder
 
03:27:25.590 --> 03:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:31.550 --> 03:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:31.560 --> 03:27:35.349 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

03:27:35.349 --> 03:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:27:41.990 --> 03:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
i'll be the chair of that committee
 
03:27:43.660 --> 03:27:43.670 align:start position:0%
so hb 579
 
03:27:43.670 --> 03:27:46.229 align:start position:0%
so hb 579
[Music]

03:27:46.229 --> 03:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:27:48.710 --> 03:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
is requiring notice to the public before
 
03:27:51.830 --> 03:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
immigration checkpoints conducted
 
03:27:54.150 --> 03:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
we recall that that was the bill we
 
03:27:56.469 --> 03:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from an american citizen
 
03:27:59.429 --> 03:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
for some reason kept getting seized at a
 
03:28:01.269 --> 03:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
immigration checkpoint
 
03:28:05.510 --> 03:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
around lincoln three times um
 
03:28:07.190 --> 03:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
sponsored the bill had some personal
 
03:28:08.830 --> 03:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
issues and he was obviously family
 
03:28:08.840 --> 03:28:10.389 align:start position:0%
issues and he was obviously family
issues

03:28:10.389 --> 03:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
issues
 
03:28:13.590 --> 03:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
we have the blessing to retain that bill
 
03:28:15.510 --> 03:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
it will require some work to be done on
 
03:28:16.790 --> 03:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
it because the
 
03:28:18.790 --> 03:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
notice requirement in the bill is
 
03:28:21.349 --> 03:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
married after the drug driving laws
 
03:28:22.710 --> 03:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh the notice for a drunk driving
 
03:28:24.389 --> 03:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
checkpoint which
 
03:28:26.790 --> 03:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't work if we're not once
 
03:28:28.630 --> 03:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
defensively doing that checkpoint
 
03:28:30.550 --> 03:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
in this case we would have to provide a
 
03:28:33.590 --> 03:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
notice we're gonna anticipate
 
03:28:42.790 --> 03:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:44.229 --> 03:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
would there be anyone who is to be
 
03:28:48.469 --> 03:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:50.830 --> 03:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
representative wallace you have been so
 
03:28:50.840 --> 03:29:01.349 align:start position:0%
representative wallace you have been so
appointed

03:29:01.349 --> 03:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:07.090 --> 03:29:07.100 align:start position:0%
yes i'd like to be in that committee
 
03:29:07.100 --> 03:29:19.670 align:start position:0%
yes i'd like to be in that committee
[Music]

03:29:19.670 --> 03:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:22.710 --> 03:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
well i'm trying to share the wealth i
 
03:29:23.910 --> 03:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
don't believe i've appointed you to a
 
03:29:23.920 --> 03:29:26.309 align:start position:0%
don't believe i've appointed you to a
subcommittee

03:29:26.309 --> 03:29:26.319 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
03:29:28.710 --> 03:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
i've been on a committee earlier in the
 
03:29:29.429 --> 03:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
year with
 
03:29:33.429 --> 03:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
uh representative guthrie
 
03:29:35.830 --> 03:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
that's true that is true you remind me
 
03:29:36.950 --> 03:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
something when you're right
 
03:29:38.309 --> 03:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
but that is just one something most
 
03:29:41.750 --> 03:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:44.229 --> 03:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
with the exception of her well we'll put
 
03:29:44.239 --> 03:29:45.030 align:start position:0%
with the exception of her well we'll put
representative

03:29:45.030 --> 03:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:29:47.110 --> 03:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
on this one and i know you're busy but
 
03:29:48.389 --> 03:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
we'll put representative burt on this
 
03:29:49.030 --> 03:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
bill as well
 
03:29:52.309 --> 03:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
what's the number 579
 
03:29:54.550 --> 03:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
but representative martin you're correct
 
03:30:05.580 --> 03:30:05.590 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:05.590 --> 03:30:13.190 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:30:13.190 --> 03:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:16.469 --> 03:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
that's a good one for me i i'm just
 
03:30:17.429 --> 03:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
asking the representative
 
03:30:18.710 --> 03:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
right is there a member of your
 
03:30:19.750 --> 03:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
conference that when you wish to
 
03:30:24.389 --> 03:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:25.990 --> 03:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
don't you already have five on there
 
03:30:27.590 --> 03:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
isn't it i
 
03:30:28.630 --> 03:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
have representative wallace
 
03:30:29.830 --> 03:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative knight representative
 
03:30:31.670 --> 03:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
burton representative welsh
 
03:30:34.630 --> 03:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
i thought you said march then i did make
 
03:30:35.670 --> 03:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
the appointment of representative
 
03:30:35.680 --> 03:30:36.389 align:start position:0%
the appointment of representative
marston

03:30:36.389 --> 03:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
marston
 
03:30:37.910 --> 03:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
under the belief that he has not been
 
03:30:40.070 --> 03:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
appointed to a subcommittee yet
 
03:30:42.150 --> 03:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
he also graciously corrected me and it
 
03:30:43.349 --> 03:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
is correct
 
03:30:46.550 --> 03:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
he is actually on a subcommittee already
 
03:30:48.550 --> 03:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
all right who's that anthologist your
 
03:30:49.830 --> 03:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
hand is raised
 
03:30:53.429 --> 03:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
yes i'll i'll go on it
 
03:31:04.469 --> 03:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:08.229 --> 03:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i have a question
 
03:31:11.269 --> 03:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
i have a question about that though
 
03:31:14.469 --> 03:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
is that something that they
 
03:31:18.950 --> 03:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
can do when it's federal
 
03:31:22.950 --> 03:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
so putting them in the spark
 
03:31:25.349 --> 03:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
so we have no control over what the
 
03:31:26.790 --> 03:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
federal officers do
 
03:31:28.229 --> 03:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
if they want to set up an immigration
 
03:31:30.950 --> 03:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
checkpoint we can't stop that
 
03:31:33.910 --> 03:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
now what happens is if if local law
 
03:31:33.920 --> 03:31:35.349 align:start position:0%
now what happens is if if local law
enforcement

03:31:35.349 --> 03:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
03:31:37.510 --> 03:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
wishes to participate in that
 
03:31:37.520 --> 03:31:39.269 align:start position:0%
wishes to participate in that
enforcement

03:31:39.269 --> 03:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
03:31:42.630 --> 03:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
there needs to be local laws that need
 
03:31:43.349 --> 03:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:31:46.150 --> 03:31:46.160 align:start position:0%
complied with what's happening is
 
03:31:47.830 --> 03:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
apparently and we heard testimony about
 
03:31:47.840 --> 03:31:48.150 align:start position:0%
apparently and we heard testimony about
this

03:31:48.150 --> 03:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:31:50.389 --> 03:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
that i found very concerning that an
 
03:31:52.309 --> 03:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
american citizen he wasn't born here but
 
03:31:53.510 --> 03:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
he is a
 
03:31:56.150 --> 03:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
just as much of a citizen as anyone else
 
03:31:57.429 --> 03:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
as an american citizen
 
03:32:01.429 --> 03:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
it keeps getting detained at these
 
03:32:04.790 --> 03:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
checkpoints which is unfortunate
 
03:32:07.110 --> 03:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
and what this would do bill's trying to
 
03:32:08.810 --> 03:32:08.820 align:start position:0%
make sure the notice would be publicized
 
03:32:08.820 --> 03:32:10.309 align:start position:0%
make sure the notice would be publicized
[Music]

03:32:10.309 --> 03:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:32:12.389 --> 03:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
so the dilemma is that we are
 
03:32:14.389 --> 03:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
publicizing a notice
 
03:32:16.710 --> 03:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
for a federal officers doing an
 
03:32:19.110 --> 03:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
immigration checkpoint
 
03:32:20.950 --> 03:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
but that's because the state officials
 
03:32:23.990 --> 03:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:26.469 --> 03:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
they notice that for a drunk driving
 
03:32:28.309 --> 03:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
checkpoint you have to go into superior
 
03:32:29.830 --> 03:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
court and get the court to approve the
 
03:32:29.840 --> 03:32:31.429 align:start position:0%
court and get the court to approve the
notice

03:32:31.429 --> 03:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
notice
 
03:32:32.870 --> 03:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
and then there's some other parts go
 
03:32:35.110 --> 03:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
along with it i i didn't think that you
 
03:32:37.190 --> 03:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
could not use the same
 
03:32:39.269 --> 03:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
notice procedures that was my humble
 
03:32:39.279 --> 03:32:40.469 align:start position:0%
notice procedures that was my humble
opinion

03:32:40.469 --> 03:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
03:32:41.830 --> 03:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
i said you really didn't come up with an
 
03:32:43.990 --> 03:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
enormous procedure but what i'm hearing
 
03:32:45.590 --> 03:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
if the co-op
 
03:32:47.190 --> 03:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
if that's how the checkpoints are being
 
03:32:48.790 --> 03:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
operated and
 
03:32:50.710 --> 03:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
you have american citizens being
 
03:32:52.309 --> 03:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
detained at these
 
03:32:53.990 --> 03:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
while they question american citizen
 
03:32:54.000 --> 03:32:55.590 align:start position:0%
while they question american citizen
citizenship

03:32:55.590 --> 03:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
citizenship
 
03:33:01.990 --> 03:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:05.030 --> 03:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
a difficult problem to say the least
 
03:33:06.870 --> 03:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
but we can't we can't stop the feds from
 
03:33:09.030 --> 03:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
doing the checkpoint
 
03:33:10.870 --> 03:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have to participate which is my
 
03:33:14.229 --> 03:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:19.349 --> 03:33:19.359 align:start position:0%

community 598

right now with representative gathering
 
03:34:26.950 --> 03:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
and perhaps in the infinite wisdom of
 
03:34:26.960 --> 03:34:28.309 align:start position:0%
and perhaps in the infinite wisdom of
scheduling

03:34:28.309 --> 03:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
scheduling
 
03:34:29.750 --> 03:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
it may make it easier if these are
 
03:34:31.670 --> 03:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
scheduled the same day so maybe you guys
 
03:34:33.269 --> 03:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
can kind of do one here and then the
 
03:34:33.279 --> 03:34:36.630 align:start position:0%
can kind of do one here and then the
next

03:34:36.630 --> 03:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:40.150 --> 03:34:40.160 align:start position:0%

03:34:48.150 --> 03:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
what's the charge matter of this one
 
03:34:49.510 --> 03:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
this has to do with the minimum
 
03:34:55.670 --> 03:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:57.269 --> 03:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
relative to a portion of a minimum
 
03:34:58.950 --> 03:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
sentence to be served to be honorable
 
03:34:59.670 --> 03:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
for full
 
03:35:03.990 --> 03:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
okay it's the truth in sentencing
 
03:35:07.030 --> 03:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:09.349 --> 03:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
the commissioner said that you would be

03:35:17.190 --> 03:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:22.830 --> 03:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:22.840 --> 03:35:33.910 align:start position:0%
 
well

03:35:33.910 --> 03:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:35.510 --> 03:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
relative to manslaughter the use of
 
03:35:37.429 --> 03:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
deadly force and circumstance involving

03:35:44.070 --> 03:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
so that listen to that bill uh we heard
 
03:35:46.070 --> 03:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
some very compelling testimony
 
03:35:49.750 --> 03:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
and just what we think about was
 
03:35:52.469 --> 03:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
the person was at someone else's house
 
03:35:53.429 --> 03:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
they purchased the
 
03:35:56.229 --> 03:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
controlled substance from that person
 
03:35:58.150 --> 03:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
due to a reaction from state-controlled
 
03:35:58.160 --> 03:35:59.269 align:start position:0%
due to a reaction from state-controlled
substance

03:35:59.269 --> 03:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
substance
 
03:36:01.030 --> 03:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
caused them to go violently there was a
 
03:36:03.190 --> 03:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
particular medical term for
 
03:36:05.110 --> 03:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
what caused that person to kind of lose
 
03:36:06.950 --> 03:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
have temporary insanity well
 
03:36:09.990 --> 03:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
the drug dealer apparently murdered
 
03:36:13.269 --> 03:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
the murder of the person
 
03:36:15.590 --> 03:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
in their own house and however under the
 
03:36:16.710 --> 03:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
current castle
 
03:36:18.830 --> 03:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
doctrine laws or whatever we have in our
 
03:36:20.070 --> 03:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
state uh
 
03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
that person is not charged something to
 
03:36:23.670 --> 03:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
think about
 
03:36:25.750 --> 03:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
i know when we think of that you think i
 
03:36:27.910 --> 03:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
think of uh
 
03:36:29.510 --> 03:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
you know one person that's clean hands
 
03:36:31.190 --> 03:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
but that's that's what happened that's
 
03:36:31.750 --> 03:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
what brought
 
03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill was intended to do
 
03:36:35.510 --> 03:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
as written
 
03:36:38.950 --> 03:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
it from what i would recall it says if
 
03:36:38.960 --> 03:36:39.429 align:start position:0%
it from what i would recall it says if
you

03:36:39.429 --> 03:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:36:41.030 --> 03:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
sell someone to control psalms in the
 
03:36:42.229 --> 03:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
overdose you can be charged by
 
03:36:43.510 --> 03:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
manslaughter so
 
03:36:46.070 --> 03:36:46.080 align:start position:0%

very worthy of a discussion at least i i
 
03:39:11.429 --> 03:39:11.439 align:start position:0%

so this with this one particularly um
 
03:41:19.830 --> 03:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
as written in new hampshire law we kind
 
03:41:21.030 --> 03:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
of came to the conclusion
 
03:41:23.750 --> 03:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's unconstitutional after the
 
03:41:23.760 --> 03:41:24.550 align:start position:0%
it's unconstitutional after the
amendment

03:41:24.550 --> 03:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:41:26.070 --> 03:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
we had a deadline that i wasn't sure we
 
03:41:28.070 --> 03:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
would be able to vet that by
 
03:41:29.510 --> 03:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
i will share that amendment with the
 
03:41:31.269 --> 03:41:31.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee i don't
 
03:41:34.630 --> 03:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
i don't even care if i get credit for it
 
03:41:37.349 --> 03:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
but what it what it needs to do is that
 
03:41:39.750 --> 03:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
our cap i got capital murder
 
03:41:44.070 --> 03:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
um rsa 630 does not have the provisions
 
03:41:46.309 --> 03:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
in there regarding juvenile but we'll
 
03:42:08.710 --> 03:42:08.720 align:start position:0%

03:42:42.309 --> 03:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
think this should be circumstances where

juvenile would be entitled but it can't

we i think i progressed with a colony on
that

03:47:02.790 --> 03:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:47:06.550 --> 03:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's knight tommy welch
 
03:47:06.560 --> 03:47:11.030 align:start position:0%

oh you did it okay and
 
03:47:15.990 --> 03:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
he uh and i think he put himself on
 
03:47:18.790 --> 03:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
there as well
 
03:47:21.510 --> 03:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
the um issue with that is that that
 
03:47:22.790 --> 03:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative calling already had an
 
03:47:24.309 --> 03:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
abandoned draft that
 
03:47:26.790 --> 03:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
was my impression would have passed had
 
03:47:29.670 --> 03:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:31.590 --> 03:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately he retained it and was out
 
03:47:33.189 --> 03:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
in new orleans we couldn't get it back
 
03:47:33.199 --> 03:47:34.469 align:start position:0%
in new orleans we couldn't get it back
but

03:47:34.469 --> 03:47:34.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:47:36.550 --> 03:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
the amended version passed in the senate
 
03:47:38.309 --> 03:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
is part of 96
 
03:47:41.670 --> 03:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
76 it's unfortunate that bill's not in
 
03:47:42.950 --> 03:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
our committee so it's
 
03:47:45.750 --> 03:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
you know but if it passes on his own so
 
03:47:46.710 --> 03:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
be it but that's
 
03:47:49.750 --> 03:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
all we have to do i mean i couldn't
 
03:47:54.190 --> 03:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
imagine any changes to the amendment
 
03:47:54.200 --> 03:47:57.910 align:start position:0%
