00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
i i have the time now um at 302
 
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to open a working group
 
00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
session on um
 
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
house or senate bill 458 and 459.
 
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.630 align:start position:0%
house or senate bill 458 and 459.
um

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
if if there are no objections
 
00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
since neither of these have a more
 
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
precise time associated with them i'd
 
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
like to flip them and start talking
 
00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
about 459 first and the reason for that
 
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
is i know that
 
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
mr ribson
 
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
is trying to get over here so he can
 
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
participate in the 458 discussion
 
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
so um is there any objection for us
 
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
starting with 459
 
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.149 align:start position:0%
starting with 459
okay

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
and i i i want to apologize
 
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.190 align:start position:0%
and i i i want to apologize
uh

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
an old military thing was you're
 
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to give uh people the maximum
 
00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
amount of time you can to get prepared
 
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
so that they can get themselves ready
 
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
for whatever you're about to do next
 
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
and and so just yesterday
 
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
is is when uh the house voted out on 4
 
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
458 and 459
 
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
here we are basically 24 hours later
 
00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
beginning to talk about it
 
00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
the bills that got assigned to division
 
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
three i think are generally kind of
 
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
complicated um there's like 430 i think
 
00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
that we have to deal with uh
 
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
next week that's got the 23 line items
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
in it for example
 
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
so uh there just wasn't a lot of
 
00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
available time
 
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to get the ball rolling and
 
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
and these two struck me as two
 
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
that could potentially
 
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
end up with an amendment and so the
 
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
sooner that we talked about the the
 
00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
possibility or the potential need for an
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
amendment just seemed it would be better
 
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
because then all parties could kind of
 
00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 align:start position:0%
get themselves ready and get their ideas
 
00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.510 align:start position:0%
get themselves ready and get their ideas
organized

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
organized
 
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna i'm gonna get us started on
 
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh 459.
 
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
this is uh relative to healthcare
 
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
facility workplace violence program
 
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
this this was amended
 
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.710 align:start position:0%
this this was amended
yesterday

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
it looks to me like the copy we have is
 
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
the correct version
 
00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
because i i don't see anything in here
 
00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
on the warrantless arrest section and
 
00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
that was the part that i understand to
 
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
deleted from the bill
 
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.070 align:start position:0%
deleted from the bill
okay

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
any representative that has
 
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
comments or thoughts that they want to
 
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
share with us about 459 i have i have a
 
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
lot of ideas on it that i'd like to talk
 
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
to you about so i i won't be shy there
 
00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh i i know that uh um
 
00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm i'm probably gonna ask um mr
 
00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 align:start position:0%
thomas to to to come to the microphone
 
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
at some point to talk with us
 
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
but do
 
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.550 align:start position:0%
but do
do

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
you know uh pat or do sharon
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
do you you all want to say anything
 
00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
about 459 and you probably voted for it
 
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday and so you just generally like
 
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.790 align:start position:0%
yesterday and so you just generally like
it

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
on honest on how about on a scale of
 
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
zero to ten
 
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
how how well do you know what's in this
 
00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
bill have you had a chance to analyze it
 
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
at all
 
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.990 align:start position:0%
at all
six

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 align:start position:0%
i read it thoroughly before yesterday
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
because i had a constituent reach out to
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
me um who didn't like the
 
00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrest and so i read the
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
whole thing including what we deleted
 
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
but i had not focused on it in fact i
 
00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
didn't know we were considering it today
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
till i arrived today i thought we were
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
only doing the sununu bill which i don't
 
00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
object i'm just saying it was a surprise
 
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
to me so i had not done prep work other
 
00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
yeah and i've i've uh thank you mr
 
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
chairman i've uh i've read it a couple
 
00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
times uh yesterday on the floor and
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
today when i knew i was going to be
 
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
sitting here
 
00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
um and i
 
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
i'm open i'm comfortable with it i did
 
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
vote for it i'm i'm open for
 
00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.469 align:start position:0%
vote for it i'm i'm open for
whatever

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
okay my point in asking the question
 
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
isn't to put anyone on the spot or
 
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
embarrass anyone it's just that i know
 
00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 align:start position:0%
that this is a much more rapid process
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
than normal and therefore you haven't
 
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
been afforded the amount of time that
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate to really prepare
 
00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
so um so i just wanted to know you know
 
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
kind of where we were representing
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
nordgren have you had a chance to get
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
dirty in this thing well no i read the
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
bills last night so i'm fine
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
all right very good
 
00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
i was looking at page one here lines
 
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
10 and 11
 
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
where it's uh it talks about
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
intimidation threatening behavior
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
verbal abuse
 
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
without regard to whether the victim
 
00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
sustains an injury psychological trauma
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
or stress
 
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.670 align:start position:0%
or stress
i'm

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of big
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
and i'm a little loud because i'm hard
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
of hearing
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
and some people are really really really
 
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
easily intimidated
 
00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:06.550 align:start position:0%
easily intimidated
um

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
i was just having a conference with a
 
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
with a person that about something
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
completely other than this
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
and she was uh
 
00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919 align:start position:0%
she went to the police station
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
that i was i don't know she said
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
something that she was intimidated she
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
was in
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
in fear of physical harm and i was just
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
talking to her
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's kind of vague for me so so can
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
we postpone just for a few minutes the
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
further discussion on that i i i see
 
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
your point i'm right now i'm just trying
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
to get a headset on where we all are it
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're prepared to get into
 
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
the bot at the body of the bill which is
 
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%

all right
 
00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.230 align:start position:0%
all right
so

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
chairman yes i just have a question
 
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.750 align:start position:0%
chairman yes i just have a question
um

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
are we supposed to be doing the policy
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
on this bill i mean i thought the policy
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
committee did the policy and we're here
 
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
to consider the financial side of it and
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
i'm just concerned that we may be going
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
beyond the scope of what traditionally
 
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
is finances work
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
i'd i'd say i'd hang i'd ask you to hang
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
on to your
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
your point because we haven't actually
 
00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
started yet
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
no i you have every reason to be
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
suspicious of me um but but it's just a
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
little it's just a little early i we i
 
00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
we haven't gone there yet
 
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
it wasn't your comments it was
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
representatives that brought
 
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
that made my antennae go up oh okay
 
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
um so my general observations of the
 
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.350 align:start position:0%
um so my general observations of the
bill

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh to tie it immediately to the
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
financial aspect
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
we would end up the fiscal note says
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
that the state would have to add
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
a couple of people
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
one to new hampshire hospital uh one to
 
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.150 align:start position:0%
one to new hampshire hospital uh one to
glencliff

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
glencliff
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh we're we're on the verge of opening
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
up hampstead so i i just think that
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
would probably be a third person
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
and so within our own state owned
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
hospital system where we're adding
 
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.310 align:start position:0%
hospital system where we're adding
manpower

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
manpower
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
we're adding workload uh and so so there
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
is cost to the state system as a result
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
and and then one can project if if
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's what it's going to take at the at
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
the state hospital level that throughout
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
the state uh others may also end up
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
incurring some additional cost
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
so um so i do think this is kind of a
 
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.110 align:start position:0%
so um so i do think this is kind of a
legitimate

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
issue for us particularly since our the
 
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.350 align:start position:0%
issue for us particularly since our the
manpower

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
manpower
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
is tied to the mandate
 
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
of having this commission and having
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
people participate in the mandate
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
of the reports that would be required
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
this is creating a workload
 
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%
for for
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
organizations throughout the state and
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
specifically uh state-owned hospitals
 
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
my first
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
reaction to it
 
00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.750 align:start position:0%
reaction to it
is

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
the mandates cost money
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
and what i have been told
 
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
with with with i think some
 
00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:27.110 align:start position:0%
with with with i think some
passion

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
passion
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
from people representing uh various uh
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
interests within the state health care
 
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:34.710 align:start position:0%
interests within the state health care
system

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.150 align:start position:0%
system
that

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
after five years of trying to get a bill
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
there's tremendous alignment about doing
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
this bill now that they want this bill
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
so just so you know in my
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
way of viewing the world
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
if if
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
organizations want to do something
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
you don't need to mandate that they do
 
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.269 align:start position:0%
you don't need to mandate that they do
it

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
two two things cannot be true
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
simultaneously to me
 
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
you you can't have everyone wanting to
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
and then also have to mandate it those
 
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
two are just logically in conflict with
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
me so i
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
one of the things i would want to do
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:25.519 align:start position:0%
is to go through it and and
 
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
write it in such a way
 
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
in which
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
the state is endorsing the premise
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
of the commission and the premise of the
 
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.790 align:start position:0%
of the commission and the premise of the
reports

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
reports
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
and setting up some structure for
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
voluntary compliance
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
and allowing a voluntary effort to
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
organize around this bill
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
over the next couple three years and
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
find out if that's going to be adequate
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
to the task before we have to use state
 
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.910 align:start position:0%
to the task before we have to use state
coercion

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
coercion
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
to get it done that that's where i'm
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
and so with that uh representative
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
you're talking about one person in each
 
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.350 align:start position:0%
you're talking about one person in each
hospital

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.550 align:start position:0%
hospital
and

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's going to be that
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
many times that these
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
uh new
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
rules are going to be put in force so i
 
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
think if you had one person that was on
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
the phone that could go and visit each
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
of these places that there might have
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
been and investigate each complaint to
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
see if it complied with this new
 
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.470 align:start position:0%
see if it complied with this new
legislation

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.350 align:start position:0%
legislation
then

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
if that person was swamped then they
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
might say okay we need someone
 
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
specifically just there
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
these things are happening so often but
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
to just put three new people on board
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
right away i don't think it's called for
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh if i if i could just uh comment on
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
that i think i my understanding of the
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
one fte for each of our hospitals is
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
derived from the fact that each facility
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
under the bill would be mandated to
 
00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:00.230 align:start position:0%
under the bill would be mandated to
provide

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
development of policies and procedures
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
that they would have to provide
 
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate training and education to
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
all employees upon new hire
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
and once a year thereafter just like the
 
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
annual training that we we got used to
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
um in that
 
00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
and then it starts to get very
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
prescriptive about what constitutes
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate education and training so
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
this is a very
 
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
into the weeds mandated program that
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
would drive some of the fte still it's a
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's a full-time job for one person at
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
its inception
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
once people get educated as to what to
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
be looking for and they get phone calls
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
about hey you need to investigate this
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
then the person could come and see what
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
the workload actually might amount to
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's my point
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.389 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for joining us i know you had
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
a drive so i appreciate it um okay okay
 
00:14:58.959 --> 00:14:59.990 align:start position:0%
a drive so i appreciate it um okay okay
so

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.470 align:start position:0%
so
so

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
i think it would be fair to ask
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
because are
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
long or walls
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
do you have any response to to my
 
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.590 align:start position:0%
do you have any response to to my
observation

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
observation
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
that making this mandatory drives ftes
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
in our own state budget and throughout
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
the state and that maybe we ought to be
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
looking at making this
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
a voluntary program instead of a
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
mandatory program do you any
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
observations or thoughts on that
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
again i don't want to put you on the
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
spot because this is also
 
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.509 align:start position:0%
spot because this is also
willy-nilly

00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly
 
00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:38.629 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly
so

00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
if i made uh thank you mr chairman uh so
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
i uh i don't have any objection going
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
through that i i
 
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
sense where you're coming from and
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to take a look at that
 
00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh with respect to rehabilitation do you
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
think there's any county
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh arms
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
this in that arm also or just the two
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
you mentioned
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
let me let me answer the question i
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
think you're asking who's affected by
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
this law it's i think it's all of the
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals within the state
 
00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
and all of the
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh urgent care centers
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of health facilities
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
that are not included in this bill such
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
as nursing homes
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
and ambulatory surgical centers those
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
are two that i know of so so this is a a
 
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.590 align:start position:0%
are two that i know of so so this is a a
partial

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
partial
 
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.949 align:start position:0%
partial
envelopment

00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
envelopment
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
of a subset of our health care system
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um yeah i think we
 
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
if we're looking to change the number
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's been suggested by this bill as
 
00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.910 align:start position:0%
that's been suggested by this bill as
representative

00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
weiler was thinking i mean i think
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
we don't want to be
 
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
you've heard me
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
i'm feeling very short in this chair too
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah so i think um
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that we keep looking back
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
at what the body of the
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
bill does um starting you know in
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
section one i think we need to
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
be sure we're not interfering with what
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
the policy committee has already deemed
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
necessary in their mind
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
when we're trying to balance how many
 
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.549 align:start position:0%
when we're trying to balance how many
people

00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
we're doing so we can make sure that
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
we're complying with
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
what the policy has already sort of been
 
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.870 align:start position:0%
what the policy has already sort of been
set

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
set
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
by the policy committee
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
i i think i think that's fair and to try
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
to explain what i what i think i'm doing
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
here or at least suggesting
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
the fiscal issue is really connected to
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
the manpower
 
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
the manpower is really driven
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
by the state providing a mandate
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
if we
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
are to change the mandate
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
so that it's
 
00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:17.590 align:start position:0%
so that it's
um

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
instead of a shall
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
it all becomes or most of it becomes a
 
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.430 align:start position:0%
it all becomes or most of it becomes a
may

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
then we are not
 
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.470 align:start position:0%
then we are not
mandating

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
mandating
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
their expense
 
00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:29.430 align:start position:0%
their expense
given

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
given
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
that the that so many interest groups in
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
the state have have stepped forward to
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
say they want this program
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't seem to me that we have to
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
mandate it in order to get this
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
commission started and get the reporting
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
started all on a voluntary basis without
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
the state mandate so yes represent organ
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
no i would just go back to the point
 
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
then that we have to make sure
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
that that theory doesn't interfere with
 
00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
the sections of the bill that the policy
 
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.270 align:start position:0%
the sections of the bill that the policy
committee

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
deemed necessary when they
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
passed the bill to us so
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know whether or not it's okay to do
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
what you're suggesting
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
bill still standing the way the policy
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
committee meant it to be
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
i i okay i i hear you and i i
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
to tell you what i've done so far is i i
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
took this document i put it into a word
 
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
document and i started going through it
 
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
line by line and i looked for every
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
place where it said shao
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
and and tried to delete shal and put a
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
may in there to see if it still worked
 
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
and uh with with
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
with some basic modification tweaking i
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
think the framework of what the policy
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
committee says is necessary to have an
 
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
effective program
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
can remain
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
it just instead of becoming
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
a coercive effort by the state it's
 
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to become a voluntary
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
compliance effort by the citizens of the
 
00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:11.510 align:start position:0%
compliance effort by the citizens of the
state

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
with the state having provided
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
some overall guidance and vision of what
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
they're trying to accomplish
 
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.510 align:start position:0%
they're trying to accomplish
yes

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so if i look on the
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
first page
 
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
line 16
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
it said the program she'll consider the
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
size and then there's another shell at
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
the end
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
of the line
 
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
um are we interfering with that
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
and making that a may
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
i guess so so the word interfere
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't use that i i would say that
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
that in the version that i've got on my
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
computer that you don't see
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
i swapped the word may for both of those
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
shells and and then in order to make it
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
the english semantics work i started to
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.149 align:start position:0%
you know
modify

00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
modify
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
how the bullets underneath it started
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
out just so it was still was english but
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
but i think it works with maze instead
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
of shells yes but but it might not work
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
with the policies committee's decision
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
on why they passed a bill like this to
 
00:21:21.039 --> 00:21:22.950 align:start position:0%
on why they passed a bill like this to
us

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
is what i'm saying that
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying though is
 
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
we can refuse the policy committee's
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
demand in this bill for it to be
 
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.149 align:start position:0%
demand in this bill for it to be
mandatory

00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
so that we can avoid
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
the cost to the state and the unfunded
 
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
mandate on the civilian
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
people or the civilian health care
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
institutions of the state
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
and i think i think we can protect the
 
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.590 align:start position:0%
and i think i think we can protect the
policy

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
by rendering it
 
00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.190 align:start position:0%
by rendering it
voluntary

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
voluntary
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
and endorsing it
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
with the vote of the legislature and the
 
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
signature of the governor
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
without having to
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's any different than
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
any other steps we've taken in any other
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
bills that come to us either we find the
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
money by saying
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
okay we might have to put it in next
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
time's budget we might have to put it in
 
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
only half this budget we might have to
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
put in six months of this budget we
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
might have to reduce the number i don't
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
think we're changing the policy we're
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
adjusting the revenue
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
to or the available revenue to match
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
what has been suggested that's always
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
been our goal and so that what the steps
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about i think fit with the
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
role the role we've always done trying
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
to make the money match the policies
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing new
 
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative walsh
 
00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:50.870 align:start position:0%
representative walsh
um

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
i think to be talking about state money
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
right now realistic i mean we're sitting
 
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
on 250 million dollar surplus clearly
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
we've got the money right now
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
and we don't know what's coming in the
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
future i mean we all know that um but
 
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:06.799 align:start position:0%
in terms of the private and a mandate on
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
the private sector um i i as i'm reading
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
through this and and trying to find the
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
shells that you found
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
some should not be replaced some of the
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements and things like
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
that if you if you take the shell and
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
make it in may you've gutted the bill
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
and it's not for financial reasons that
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
you're gutting the bill and i think
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
we've got to be very careful going
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
through and changing that language
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
i'm also you also started with an
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
assumption that this is one full-time
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
employee for each facility
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not convinced it is i think the
 
00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.310 align:start position:0%
i'm not convinced it is i think the
first

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
few months of this are a little onerous
 
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
but you could have somebody like a
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
director of hr be doing this kind of
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
stuff or somebody in the nhr department
 
00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
do a lot of this kind of stuff in terms
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
of the policy
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
and i think that it's erroneous to
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
assume that we are imposing the cost of
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
one full-time employee on every facility
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
here uh to do this
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
so so to just that point i'm i'm quoting
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
the lba whose methodology ends up with
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
the sentence and i quote to total
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
combined costs for the two facilities
 
00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:13.720 align:start position:0%
will therefore be
 
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
272 000
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
per year there's no reference to
 
00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
it'll be x for the first three months
 
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
and then it'll go away it's it says it's
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
272 per year and they counted on two
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
facilities we happen to know that
 
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
there's a third facility that's likely
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
to come online hampstead
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
so if it's if these two hospitals need
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
it then i it's a fairly reasonable
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
assumption that the the third would as
 
00:24:40.559 --> 00:24:41.510 align:start position:0%
assumption that the the third would as
well

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
right but i preface my comments by
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
saying what we're talking about my
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
comments specifically referred to
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
private facilities so i'm thinking of
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
some of the smaller hospitals like maybe
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
up in berlin that may not need one
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
full-time employee to do this and may be
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
able to incorporate it into hr
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
um and so i agree on the state it's very
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
clear what the fiscal note says but
 
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
that's why i preface my comments with
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
respect to the private sector that this
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily a cram-down of one
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
full-time employee on every private
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
sector facility um so that that's one of
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
the thoughts i had my other concern is
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
is by making this more voluntary
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
we have seen some of the hospitals in
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
this state
 
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
get in financial trouble we just saw
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
laconia which got bought by concord
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
because they were way underwater
 
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.990 align:start position:0%
because they were way underwater
financially

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
financially
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
if we make this
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
not mandatory
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
are we then
 
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
that would likely be one of the first
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
things that some hospital cuts if
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
they're in financial trouble and and i
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
ask this as a real question are we then
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
setting up a situation where we're
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
endangering the employees because
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
if it's not mandatory the hospitals
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily going to follow all
 
00:25:47.919 --> 00:25:48.710 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily going to follow all
this

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
and and i just think it's something that
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
we need to consider along the way is
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
you know the purpose of this is to
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
protect employees so by making this all
 
00:25:57.679 --> 00:25:58.870 align:start position:0%
protect employees so by making this all
voluntary

00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
voluntary
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
are we then gutting the ultimate purpose
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
of this and that is protecting the
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
employees from the dangers that are out
 
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.110 align:start position:0%
employees from the dangers that are out
there

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
i i think that's a fair question uh i i
 
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
i i think you exposed sort of a kind of
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
a double-edged sword there that um we do
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
have hospitals that are uh at financial
 
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
risk and that this would represent some
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
cost it's not zero they can't do this
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
for free
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
so we're throwing another mandate on a
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
financially distressed institution
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
potentially and that may be the straw
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
that breaks their back i doubt it but
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the the way i tie those
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
two thoughts together is if they're
 
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
financially troubled institutions out
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
there we shouldn't be imposing more
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
mandates that
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
i would just ask that at what cost at
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
what cost to the safety of the employees
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:56.149 align:start position:0%
okay so
i

00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
i spent 43 years in healthcare
 
00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:00.870 align:start position:0%
i spent 43 years in healthcare
and

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
i have never run into a healthcare
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
administrator that didn't care deeply
 
00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.750 align:start position:0%
administrator that didn't care deeply
about

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh the productivity and safety
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
of the nursing staff and other staff
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
operating within the hospital i i don't
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think this is an area
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
where we
 
00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:21.669 align:start position:0%
where we
are

00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:27:21.679 --> 00:27:22.710 align:start position:0%
are
dealing

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
dealing
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
with management
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
that is uh
 
00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.630 align:start position:0%
that is uh
unwilling

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
unwilling
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
to do the smart things to take care of
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
their workforce particularly when
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
nursing staff and other
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
members of the workforce are so scarce
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
if if anything this is when employee
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
employers would go the extra mile
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
and and if they're hearing from their
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
their nursing staff i keep saying
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
nursing staff because uh the lobbyists
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
for the nursing association spent a
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
bunch of time with me so i'm
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
reacting to that feedback
 
00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
if if the nursing staff
 
00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
is is concerned about this and they can
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
point to a law saying hey you know the
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
state really thinks it'd be a great idea
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
for us to have this local workplace
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
violence program i it just seems to me
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
that this stuff would come together
 
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
voluntarily and wouldn't have to be
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
mandatory and and if it is true that
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
that the state has
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
struggled with this for five years to
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
try to get something like this together
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
i think the fact that we would
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
take a step forward with some sort of a
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
law to institute this or to
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
recognize and honor the principles of
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
managing workforce violence that
 
00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:39.110 align:start position:0%
managing workforce violence that
that

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
that again the
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
voluntary nature of our citizenry would
 
00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
kick in and solve the problem
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
and if it doesn't we can come back in
 
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
two or three years
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
i i would love to believe
 
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.669 align:start position:0%
i i would love to believe
that

00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
workplaces are as caring about their
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
employees as you think but less than two
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
weeks ago i had a lengthy conversation
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
with a nurse who for about 20 years
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
worked up at dartmouth-hitchcock and it
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
didn't make my papers where i lived but
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
apparently in the last couple of years
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
i've had two nurses strangled up at
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
dartmouth hitchcock neither of which
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
were killed but one of which was
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
disabled they literally snapped the the
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
guy snapped the vertebrae in her neck
 
00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:16.789 align:start position:0%
guy snapped the vertebrae in her neck
and

00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
right and the other one was not as badly
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
injured but was quite significantly
 
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
injured they did bring somebody in and
 
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
there's now a
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
law officer in the er room up at
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
dartmouth hitchcock because of that but
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
they do not impose enough
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
safety precautions up there and this
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
nurse that had worked there for 20 years
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
is now working at concord hospital
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
because she didn't feel safe up at
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
dartmouth-hitchcock and
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
this is in the middle of covet she's
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
she's been at concord less than six
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
months and it's because dartmouth isn't
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
following through with enough safety
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
precautions and you're right they're
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
losing staff and they're short staffed
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
up there they couldn't afford to lose
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
her at all but they did so i'm just
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
saying that even with two attempted
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
murders up there with two serious
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
strangulations up there
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
she felt that they still were not
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
protecting their employees and with that
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
in the back of my head i'm a little more
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
reluctant to make this voluntary hearing
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
i mean that firsthand story i'm serious
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
it was less than two weeks ago that she
 
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
spent a long time telling me this story
 
00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.430 align:start position:0%
spent a long time telling me this story
and

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
you know those i know it's anecdotal but
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
those things stick with you
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
so implicit in your in this in this
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
tragic story and
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
it's horrifying but
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
is the idea that if a stand
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
if the state mandates a reporting system
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
that that will stop violence
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
i i don't i don't know that there's a
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
logical connection to mandating a
 
00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
reporting process
 
00:30:46.159 --> 00:30:47.269 align:start position:0%
reporting process
and

00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
actually affecting directly affecting
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
the behavior
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
of nearer due wells that would go out
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
and violently attack a person i i think
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
that level of violence exists whether or
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
not we're reporting on it frankly but i
 
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:02.559 align:start position:0%
agree with you but i think whether or
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
not the hospital has additional staff to
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
help protect its employees is what this
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
is all about and and i agree the
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
narrative wells are going to do what
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to do regardless the
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
what kind of protection what kind of
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
procedures are in the hospital to try
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
and limit their ability to reach anybody
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
and to hurt them
 
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.190 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
weiler

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
weiler
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
i wonder if there's anybody here that
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
was prevalent at the hearings in the
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
policy committees perhaps the senator
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
to hear if there was any um explanation
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
of how really prevalent this is whether
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
there's you know one time that's yeah if
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
somebody gets tried to get strangled
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
that's going to be talked about forever
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
whether it's three four years ago or
 
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.389 align:start position:0%
whether it's three four years ago or
whatever

00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:31:46.399 --> 00:31:47.110 align:start position:0%
whatever
but

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know if if this is not something
 
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's happening
 
00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.750 align:start position:0%
that's happening
frequently

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
frequently
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's overkill
 
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
that was an invitation if you'd like to
 
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
all right you were not on that policy
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
com you're you're here really for 458
 
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
when we get to it right is that correct
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
yeah all right so
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
i would invite either or both or all of
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
the lobbyists to speak to any of the
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
things that you've heard in the last 20
 
00:32:24.399 --> 00:32:35.350 align:start position:0%
things that you've heard in the last 20
minutes

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
good afternoon paula minihan
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
for the hospital association
 
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
and i i was at the hearing so i can
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
answer that question
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
hi sean thomas with the mers and praise
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
hall we represent the new hampshire
 
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
sean thomas
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
what's with the sage right
 
00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.190 align:start position:0%
what's with the sage right
yes

00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.230 align:start position:0%
yes
u-s-h-a-u-n

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:02.890 align:start position:0%
third option
 
00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:03.990 align:start position:0%
third option
[Laughter]

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
s-h-a u-n u-n
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
the third option he said
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
so go ahead so i think it was
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
representative weiler asked the question
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
relative to the prevalence of these
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
incidences and
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
while um some make the press on
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a lot of them do not there
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
was a
 
00:33:25.039 --> 00:33:26.230 align:start position:0%
was a
security

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
security
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
specialist that works at catholic
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
medical center john patty who is
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
works there now but and is in charge of
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
security was um on the on the manchester
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
police department for years he's retired
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
um chief i believe and he indicated for
 
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
13 hospitals that did report
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
to us through the hospital association
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
there were approximately i think 600 um
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
incidences in the last year um or so i
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
it actually it happens unfortunately
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
more frequently than any of us would
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
like to um believe
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
and they represented
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
um you know there are those that um you
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
know um end up um disabled
 
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
um and and then there are those that are
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
punched that um do not go out on workers
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
comp for instance so there's a whole
 
00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:26.790 align:start position:0%
comp for instance so there's a whole
variety

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
variety
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you you're welcome
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
if i i would add to that that my own
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
daughter works as an lna at the elliott
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
and in parkland and she treats uh
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
geriatric dementia patients
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
and she'll she frequently is attacked by
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
the patients themselves so so i have
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely no doubt that this is a very
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
real uh problem so so mr thomas go ahead
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
yeah just to add to that as well uh so
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
the nurses association along with others
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
completed a pilot study at the end of
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
specific to merrimack county 37 percent
 
00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.950 align:start position:0%
specific to merrimack county 37 percent
of

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
nurses within the previous six months
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
had experienced physical aggression
 
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.710 align:start position:0%
had experienced physical aggression
uh

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
73 had experienced some form of violent
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
incident that's not further defined here
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
something less obviously than physical
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
aggression and you know in this this
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
study also points back to
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
studies that have been completed
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
previously one of those and this goes
 
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.750 align:start position:0%
previously one of those and this goes
obviously

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
several years back i think the study was
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
completed back between 2011 to 2013
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
but that study looked at a national
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
24 000 workplace assaults nationally
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
and 75 percent of those occur in
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
healthcare settings
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
so healthcare workers are far more
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
likely to be victims of workplace safety
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
incidents or violence violence incidents
 
00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.550 align:start position:0%
incidents or violence violence incidents
um

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
than in other workplaces
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
and i will and i'll say to that as well
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
obviously they're in a unique situation
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
too because when they are subject to
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
to the person who likely caused them
 
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.310 align:start position:0%
to the person who likely caused them
harm

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
and can i also say um i i don't know if
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
everyone knows the genesis of this bill
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
but this was um many years in the making
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
it was actually a bill um that result
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
that was requested um by the nurses
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
association hospital association and a
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
number of other organizations in 2019 um
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
to create a commission but 2000 2019
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
2020 of course in march of 2020
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
everything is shut down so this was a
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
victim that bill was a victim of the um
 
00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
of the shutdown and and of the pandemic
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
so then in uh we asked senator gray to
 
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
resubmit that legislation which he did
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
in 20 in the fall of 2020 so in 2021
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
the commission was actually after um
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
committee of conference turned into a
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
study committee which met all
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
fall and into the winter of this past um
 
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
green and litchfield all sat on that
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
study committee and senator
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
sherman participated in every single one
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
of those that resulted in the
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
legislation that you see today that did
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
include the warrantless arrests that i
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
know it has been taken removed from the
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
legislation but the study committee um
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
and i actually sorry i meant to bring
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
you the report um but i can get that
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
report it shows i think they met seven
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
or eight times
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
and there was a very thoughtful and and
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
thorough discussion by all stakeholders
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
including the
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
aclu drc nami
 
00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:00.950 align:start position:0%
aclu drc nami
us

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
here present today the home care
 
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
association health care association etc
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
every and that's how we ended up when
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
care and
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
there are different reasons um and i
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
think someone asked about um
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
the health care association or counties
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
um the hosp the nursing homes have to do
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
their own reporting so it was determined
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
that they already report um in a through
 
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
cms um centers of medicaid and medicaid
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
serve medicare and medicaid services
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
they have to report certain um
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
incidences so they
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
they determined that that was um
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate this is a request of the
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
stakeholders we are we're asking um for
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
this help we're asking for the state to
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
in the legislature to put this in place
 
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
so that we have uniformity i mentioned
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
the 600 incidences of 13 hospitals
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
we only had 13 hospitals report for
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
various reasons it was not it's not a
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
mandate it was a request and
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
they do have workplace
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
violence prevention programs but they
 
00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.230 align:start position:0%
violence prevention programs but they
vary

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
vary
 
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
um and they they do have de-escalation
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
but they vary we're looking for
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
uniformities to ensure that we can have
 
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.190 align:start position:0%
uniformities to ensure that we can have
a

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
good database to allow for a
 
00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.910 align:start position:0%
good database to allow for a
confidential

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
discussion of these incidences to lead
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
to best practices and hopefully
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
improvement in the entire system so
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
again we are
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
we are requesting that the state we need
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
we need your help we want this to be
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
a requirement
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
because we want uniformity we want
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
inclusivity and we want to protect our
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
health care workers and we believe that
 
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
this is i bel this is one of the highest
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
priority bills for the hospital
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
association and i believe it is also for
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
the nurses association
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
and i am happy to answer any other
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
questions but honestly every single
 
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
section of this bill was was discussed
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
and debated in subcommittees and then
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
and um the commission is mirrored
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
exactly after the quality commission
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
that has been in place that you
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
authorized 17 years ago that is now
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
a permanent commission it was um
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
initially not a permanent commission but
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
it got reauthorized every five years and
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
the last time it was made permanent
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald sponsored that bill a
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
couple years ago
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
and the protection the confidentiality
 
00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
is to ensure
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
that there is um
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
everyone is
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
that there's no discovery of the
 
00:40:47.359 --> 00:40:48.470 align:start position:0%
that there's no discovery of the
information

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
discussed at the commission level right
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
now that commission is um voluntarily
 
00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.870 align:start position:0%
now that commission is um voluntarily
staffed

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
staffed
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
and we are 100 percent funding through
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
the hospital association the foundation
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
for healthy communities the quality
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
commission um it was um we do not um we
 
00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
are not able to do that with this
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
commission and um and the department of
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
hhs um is not um
 
00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.790 align:start position:0%
hhs um is not um
um

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
concerned with being responsible for um
 
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
organizing the commission but it will be
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
staffed obviously by every member of the
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
host each hospital will have a member
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
participating likely the security
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
officer or someone responsible for
 
00:41:27.839 --> 00:41:29.349 align:start position:0%
officer or someone responsible for
security

00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
security
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
which is different than the quality
 
00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:35.349 align:start position:0%
which is different than the quality
commission

00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.359 --> 00:41:36.309 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
if the proposal to make this voluntary
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
rather than mandatory would you find
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
that problematic
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
i do believe that that would be
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
concerning because we need to have um
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
the um the weight i guess of the the
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
authority and the weight of the
 
00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
legislature to
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
require that we have you again everyone
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
is reporting in a uniform way so i do
 
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
have concerns about making it voluntary
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
i do
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
so that is that why there are fines in
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
here two thousand dollars if uh if they
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
don't comply
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
yeah that that's certainly part of the
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
reason i mean if i
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
i don't mean to interrupt representative
 
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
if i just if i may respond to
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative wilder's question as well
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
um so we too think it would be
 
00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
problematic the concern is if this is
 
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.990 align:start position:0%
problematic the concern is if this is
voluntary

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
voluntary
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
then we basically maintain the status
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
quo and we don't we don't take any steps
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
forward it guts the bill
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
um i think if
 
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
i understand i understand the reasoning
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
or the the argument that to the extent
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
the hospitals and the urgent cares want
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
to do this then why don't they do it
 
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
um i i guess i would say to that if even
 
00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
one decided not to participate there's
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
less incentive for the others to
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
participate because what you get out of
 
00:42:57.599 --> 00:42:58.390 align:start position:0%
participate because what you get out of
this

00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
in the end is
 
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
an additional in addition to
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
standardized data complete data
 
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
and that is what is useful
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
when you know
 
00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.150 align:start position:0%
when you know
taking

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
taking
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
learning and sharing that information
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
learning from that information
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
and incorporating the best practices you
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
learned from that shared information
 
00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
bringing that back to your hospital or
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
to your urgent care and improving your
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
internal policies um
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
that enhance the safety of our
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.119 --> 00:43:30.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
that just triggers like four different
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
thoughts in my head so thank you for
 
00:43:34.079 --> 00:43:35.270 align:start position:0%
thoughts in my head so thank you for
that

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
the primary reason that this program is
 
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
needed as i understand it is because
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
employees are asking their employers to
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
and that the employees
 
00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.270 align:start position:0%
and that the employees
are

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
operating under some threat and some
 
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
duress and so therefore the employers
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
should be predisposed
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
to providing them with safety and
 
00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
security in the workforce
 
00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:04.230 align:start position:0%
security in the workforce
i

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day is the primary
 
00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.109 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day is the primary
reason

00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
that hospitals should want to do this is
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
am i mistaken there
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
i i'll let paula add to this as well but
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
i think hospitals do already address it
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
to your point i think what this seeks to
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
address is
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
is something beyond what is already
 
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
being provided this is an opportunity
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
for the hospitals all the hospitals in
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
the state the urgent cares to get
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
together and to confidentially
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
freely and openly discuss incidents that
 
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
are occurring in each of their
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
facilities so that they may learn from
 
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
those incidents and take that
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
information back to their own facilities
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
and improve the processes currently in
 
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.870 align:start position:0%
and improve the processes currently in
place

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
so i want to pick at the word
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity the opportunity for every
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
hospital to do that is there today
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
what what we're not seeking is
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them to participate what
 
00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:02.839 align:start position:0%
we're doing is we're trying to create a
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
mandate that is uh
 
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
punishable by fine for not complying
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
with with the state law
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
this isn't about opportunity this is
 
00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:14.230 align:start position:0%
this isn't about opportunity this is
about

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh coercion right well i i don't think
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
the opportunity exists today and i mean
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
the reason these hospitals
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
these hospitals won't get together
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
because currently you wouldn't go to
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
another hospital and discuss these
 
00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.109 align:start position:0%
another hospital and discuss these
incidents

00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
incidents
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
um without just without the
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
confidentiality provisions included in
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
and you also
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's this data the sharing of
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
information is less useful to the extent
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
it isn't standardized in a
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
common reporting standardized format so
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
if we operate standardization though if
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
we offered standardization then it could
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
be done in a standardized way and the
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
standardization doesn't need to be
 
00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:55.839 align:start position:0%
mandatory that can be suggestive
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
hl7 for example the way in which we uh
 
00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.829 align:start position:0%
hl7 for example the way in which we uh
manage

00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
manage
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
i.t transactions in healthcare that's
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
not a mandatory standard it's a standard
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
that people all voluntarily use i so i i
 
00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.750 align:start position:0%
that people all voluntarily use i so i i
don't

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we need to mandate
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
something in order to standardize the
 
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
information reporting if voluntary you
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
only standardize the information with
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
respect to the participating hospitals
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
you don't standardize the information
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
across the board
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
and we see this similar to the infection
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
um reporting that the hospitals must do
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
that the state um does so we we honestly
 
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
see this as building upon those types of
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
programs that already exist so we don't
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
see it as a mandate we see it as a
 
00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.349 align:start position:0%
see it as a mandate we see it as a
supporting

00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
legislation that we need we are asking
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
the legislature to support
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
our health care workers to ensure again
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
that we have the ability to
 
00:46:59.589 --> 00:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
report uniformly
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
and have the commission
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
um set up so that they can have that
 
00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.150 align:start position:0%
um set up so that they can have that
confidential

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
00:47:08.069 --> 00:47:08.079 align:start position:0%
safe environment to have those
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
discussions exactly like what goes on in
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
the quality commission
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
so that they're not discoverable
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
i i don't remember how the um how the
 
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.470 align:start position:0%
i i don't remember how the um how the
fine

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
section got in there to be honest but
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's we we do not have a problem with it
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
per se
 
00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
but i don't recall how that got in there
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
i think it just all kind of
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
again this was a a comprehensive
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input and we are looking to
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
ensure that we do have 100 participation
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
and again the urgent care centers we
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
don't represent them hospitals do have
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
them but um we
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
they they
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to be part of this as well um led
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
by um dr punt from convenient md but he
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
also spoke with clear choice md which
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
are two independent for-profit um
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
entities um that i think you know are
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the state um that
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
they want to
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
be part of this as well so i think it
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
sends a very strong message from the
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire that they care
 
00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:15.990 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire that they care
about

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
their health care workforce and um this
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
is this is what they they believe is
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
important to ensure
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
they that the nurses and the health care
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
workers feel like they will be
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
heard there will be a reporting process
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
their information will be protected
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
and that something actually will happen
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
um because we don't have the ability to
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
sit around the table now we don't i know
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
you and i have had this conversation um
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
and but we're not protected they can't
 
00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
they are not protected now um there and
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
i can get you um the genesis of why we
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
put that um language in the
 
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.910 align:start position:0%
put that um language in the
confidentiality

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
confidentiality
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
in the healthcare
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
quality let's hold off on
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
confidentiality in this
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
because we've got exposed for a moment
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
the idea that there's a two thousand
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
dollar fine here for not com not no
 
00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:09.750 align:start position:0%
dollar fine here for not com not no
compliance

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.030 align:start position:0%
compliance
so

00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
would the hospital association with the
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
nursing association be okay if we struck
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
the two thousand dollar fine for failure
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
speaking for the nurses association we
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
would be okay with striking that
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
language i think that is a good
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
alternative to making the entire bill
 
00:49:32.559 --> 00:49:36.390 align:start position:0%
alternative to making the entire bill
voluntary

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.190 align:start position:0%
 
we

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
at the hospital association would echo
 
00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
what the nurses association indicated we
 
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
are okay with um striking it we do did
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
not take a position on that we support
 
00:49:50.549 --> 00:49:50.559 align:start position:0%
the entire bill um we believe all of it
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
kind of fits together um
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
and you know we're so
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it at that
 
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
okay and then and back to the the notion
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's been stated here a couple of times
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
that you need a hundred percent of the
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
information in order to have any useful
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
information or towards that effect
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
when i took statistics a long time ago
 
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
we accepted that you could get
 
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559 align:start position:0%
good information
 
00:50:18.559 --> 00:50:19.670 align:start position:0%
good information
by

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
doing good random sampling or having
 
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
enough of a population sample so that
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
you got the the the data of the overall
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
population with just a sample
 
00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:31.910 align:start position:0%
population with just a sample
so

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
so when you say you you have to have
 
00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
everyone participate in order for the
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
information to be useful
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
i i'm having a hard time buying that so
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
could you walk me through the logic of
 
00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.430 align:start position:0%
could you walk me through the logic of
why

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
if you had like 60 of the institutions
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
complying that that wouldn't give you a
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
good enough picture so you really could
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
extrapolate to the other 40 percent what
 
00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:55.910 align:start position:0%
extrapolate to the other 40 percent what
what

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
help me with that
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
the healthcare workers
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
feel protected throughout the state and
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
so to have it voluntary and have some
 
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
hospitals participate and some not i
 
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
don't know what message that would send
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
to the healthcare employees that are
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
working in those institutions that are
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
not able to participate for whatever
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
reason there they maybe have
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
um you know a workforce shortage they
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
they are very small as representative
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
wall said and they maybe are struggling
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason so again this is um
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
being making it required again if you
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
look at what is required under the
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
healthcare associated infection
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
reporting there is no
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
95 it's everyone has to report they may
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
not have any to report um that would be
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
great but they all have to report that
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
is a require as a state requirement um
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
and i think the other problem that we
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
have heard and i wish senator sherman
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
was here because he is very articulate
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
when it comes to this and i wish maybe
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
we could have nami and drc be here next
 
00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.309 align:start position:0%
we could have nami and drc be here next
week

00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:52:06.319 --> 00:52:07.109 align:start position:0%
week
they

00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
want to know
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
as far as the data who is actually like
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
where the air where the problems lie and
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
are they um
 
00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:18.390 align:start position:0%
are they um
how

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
how severe they are and who is actually
 
00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:23.030 align:start position:0%
how severe they are and who is actually
um

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
um involved in these violent incidences
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
because there may be best practices that
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
can be
 
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
moved forward
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
if we have more robust data so to say a
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
hundred percent you're right i took
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
statistics too it's it doesn't need to
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
be a hundred percent but to have a
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
robust database maybe that's a better
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
way to put it so that we can make sure
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
that there are best practices being
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
implemented that are taking into account
 
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:51.829 align:start position:0%
implemented that are taking into account
um

00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
all the incidences that are occurring
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
so i i think i i would like to ask um
 
00:52:59.670 --> 00:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
the drc and nami to speak because they
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
they're very they're very um
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
thoughtful about this as well
 
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
do they have representatives in here
 
00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:07.270 align:start position:0%
do they have representatives in here
today

00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
maybe if they don't mr ripple could you
 
00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
could you help us get an invite to them
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
next week
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh and and uh it
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
looks like mr thomas wants to respond
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
and then um uh representative erf has a
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
comment yeah to your question
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
representative edwards about the
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
percentage too and it and i certainly
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
understand that you don't need a hundred
 
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
but how do you ensure
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
some sort of critical mass without a
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
requirement because i i made this point
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
earlier to the extent one doesn't
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
participate then another won't
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
participate and then soon there's no
 
00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
incentive for any to participate and so
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
i be you know i don't know how you would
 
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
mandate 75 requirement or 90 requirement
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
i mean the practical thing to do would
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
and i and i i believe that
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
representatives from the drc are here
 
00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.910 align:start position:0%
representatives from the drc are here
today

00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
i thank you mr chair could you send the
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
link to this commission study report to
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
mr ripple so you can distribute it to us
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
i just want to know
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
was the impetus for this bill
 
00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
is there another state
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
or there's a model bill or some place
 
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
this was was copied from and do we know
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
anything about the experience of that
 
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
other state where it came from
 
00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:31.510 align:start position:0%
other state where it came from
um

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
some states we've been um the impetus
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
for this particular bill goes back to
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
2000 probably 18 when represented excuse
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
me senator gray was contacted
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
by one of her his constituents that had
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
been assaulted at new hampshire hospital
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
because she's a nurse i was a nurse
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
there that was the initial impetus for
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
bringing all the stakeholders together
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
um to have this discussion um since then
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
um in my tenure at the hospital
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
association and i believe um steve and
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
our president is here um behind me so um
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
and he deals more at a national scale
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
but um throughout this throughout the
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
country there says this is a major um
 
00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
problem so there have been other um um
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
bill's past that actually make it a
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
higher penalty
 
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
criminal penalty to assault a health
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
care worker we chose very
 
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
definitively to not go down that path we
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
did not believe that making it a higher
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
penalty was actually going to be as
 
00:55:42.079 --> 00:55:43.589 align:start position:0%
penalty was actually going to be as
instructive

00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
instructive
 
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
as this would be to collect data to have
 
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
a commission to have discussions and
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
come up with best practices
 
00:55:53.589 --> 00:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
because what we have learned um is that
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
in other parts of the country it may be
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
a feel-good um piece of legislation but
 
00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't do anything um and and
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
so and i'll let i think the nurses
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
association felt the same way also as
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
far as the model we used um joint
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
commission um as some of the modeling
 
00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
for collecting the data we used osha um
 
00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:15.270 align:start position:0%
for collecting the data we used osha um
the

00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
um as far as the workplace violence
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
prevention program model
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
and we use the quality commission like i
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned that is now in statute
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
permanent statute here as our model for
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
the commission the um and the
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrest was um
 
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
a separate discussion and that was
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
coming out of as you know the the
 
00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
criminal statute which um and we had the
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
attorney general's and um
 
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:42.559 align:start position:0%
assistant attorney general involved in
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
that did you want to add thank you
 
00:56:46.079 --> 00:56:47.670 align:start position:0%
that did you want to add thank you
okay

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.349 align:start position:0%
okay
and

00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
so we have a representative from the drc
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
would you tell us your name and tell us
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
what a drc is and and then do you need
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
any background we've been talking now at
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
least for 30 minutes and you've missed
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
most of it um well i'll i'll introduce
 
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
myself and maybe if you ask your
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
question i'll be able to answer and
 
00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:10.799 align:start position:0%
hopefully i'll be all right um
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
so i'm karen rosenberg i'm the policy
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
director at the disability rights center
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire we're the protection
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
and advocacy system for people with
 
00:57:17.599 --> 00:57:19.030 align:start position:0%
and advocacy system for people with
disabilities

00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
and i am aware that you're talking about
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
sb 459 the workforce safety
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
bill that our office was involved in
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
mostly my predecessor although i was
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
somewhat involved in the portion of this
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
bill that deals with exceptions to the
 
00:57:35.359 --> 00:57:36.470 align:start position:0%
bill that deals with exceptions to the
warrantless

00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
warrantless
 
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
arrest statute
 
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
that limits the warrant that that
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
expands it slightly in cases of um when
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
when individuals may really
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know present a danger and that would
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
negatively impact their ability to get
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
medical care or interfere with the
 
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
operations of the facility and so we
 
00:57:56.549 --> 00:57:56.559 align:start position:0%
worked really
 
00:57:56.559 --> 00:57:57.430 align:start position:0%
worked really
we

00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
we and my predecessor worked a lot with
 
00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.510 align:start position:0%
we and my predecessor worked a lot with
um

00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald and others around and
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
and also with the hospital association
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
around creating some language that would
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
try to avoid a situation where
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
individuals with really significant
 
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
mental illness are foreclosed from
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
securing treatment when their behavior
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
really is the
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
manifestation of the disability so so
 
00:58:24.549 --> 00:58:24.559 align:start position:0%
your your part in this bill is to make
 
00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:25.839 align:start position:0%
sure that it
 
00:58:25.839 --> 00:58:27.190 align:start position:0%
sure that it
doesn't

00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
go too far and
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
basically begin to penalize or do harm
 
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:33.430 align:start position:0%
basically begin to penalize or do harm
to

00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
patients that have mental health and
 
00:58:37.589 --> 00:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
other issues that have are
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
causing them maybe to act out exactly
 
00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a very hard thing to find a
 
00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
balance for i'm sure that was tough
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of wordsmithing
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:53.839 align:start position:0%
all right well um i i we could get into
 
00:58:57.030 --> 00:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality piece of this um
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
but i
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
i i'll just i'll just point out that as
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
as a former
 
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
privacy officer uh
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
a couple of uh
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
medical device manufacturers
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh it it struck me
 
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.750 align:start position:0%
uh it it struck me
that

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's probably not appropriate on line 24
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
of page 2
 
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
to say that the names and job titles of
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
employees involved in the incident
 
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
should be reported to the overall
 
00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:27.589 align:start position:0%
should be reported to the overall
commission

00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
and as i'm looking at this
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
one time i read this
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
i thought
 
00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
that it also reported the name of the
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
perpetrator of the incident but but now
 
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
that i'm looking at it again i'm not
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
seeing that piece
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
no it actually on line 20 36 and 37 if
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
the incident involved a patient the
 
00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
patient's name or other similar
 
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
identifier shall not be included in the
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
report mine ends at line 35 on that page
 
00:59:58.319 --> 00:59:59.510 align:start position:0%
report mine ends at line 35 on that page
which

00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i have the bill as introduced
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
okay so we're we're going to go ahead
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
and we're going to protect the
 
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of the patient's
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
information what if it's the patient's
 
01:00:14.799 --> 01:00:16.870 align:start position:0%
information what if it's the patient's
brother

01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
brother
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
would the brother
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
who's who's acting tough in the hallway
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
of the hospital would would would his
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
name be reportable
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
and actually on page three of the bill
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
as amended by the house but it's
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
page three
 
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
lines one and two if the incident
 
01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
involved a patient the patient's name or
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
other similar identifier shall not be
 
01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
included in the report right i agree i'm
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
i'm asking a different question now
 
01:00:51.599 --> 01:00:52.470 align:start position:0%
i'm asking a different question now
if

01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
it happens that the patient's
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
brother is the jerk
 
01:00:59.589 --> 01:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
does that brother
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
does that name get reported
 
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
and if not
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
what precludes the reporting of that
 
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:13.109 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
if the person is not the patient then
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
they can be removed from the facility
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
because they're trespassing so you
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't consider that workplace
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
violence if you could remove somebody
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
for trespass
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean that that individual to the
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
extent they have a personal relationship
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
with the patient
 
01:01:37.829 --> 01:01:37.839 align:start position:0%
would be covered here
 
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
you're right i mean that's that's that's
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding uh the patient's name
 
01:01:44.549 --> 01:01:44.559 align:start position:0%
is the only one specifically protected
 
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
as to any other names this bill is
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
silent i can tell you you know it was a
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
concern of the nurses association
 
01:01:55.109 --> 01:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
back in the senate uh that this would
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
have included the name and job title of
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
the employee so i think there's an i
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
think there's an opportunity there too
 
01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:03.829 align:start position:0%
think there's an opportunity there too
um

01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:05.839 align:start position:0%
right i mean because it explicitly to
 
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
your point mr thomas it explicitly says
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
in here that the names and job titles of
 
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
the employees are involved in the
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
incident will be reported
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of the concerns about
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
confidentiality would just go away
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
if there was a clear categorical
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
statement that that no identifying
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
information could should be submitted in
 
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
any report that goes outside of the
 
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
hospital well i i guess i would say to
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
that and
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
and i think there's i think we can
 
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
certainly improve the confidentiality in
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
this section
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
with respect to the larger
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
confidentiality section the one that we
 
01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839 align:start position:0%
think is crucial to this bill
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
and these hospitals coming together and
 
01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
i don't the concern i don't think the
 
01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:53.039 align:start position:0%
issue there is with respect to names or
 
01:02:53.039 --> 01:02:54.630 align:start position:0%
issue there is with respect to names or
identities

01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
identities
 
01:02:56.789 --> 01:02:56.799 align:start position:0%
the issue is with respect to
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
the incident
 
01:02:58.079 --> 01:02:59.029 align:start position:0%
the incident
um

01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:59.039 --> 01:02:59.990 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
if a lawsuit say was filed
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
any free and open discussion among the
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
hospital members discussing that
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
incident would then be subject to
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
discovery and that poses a whole new
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
issue and that's really what this
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
confidentiality piece in here is
 
01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
intended to okay so there's two layers
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
yes and and and i just want to let you
 
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
know as i understand both layers i agree
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
with you
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
you know that on the layer that all
 
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
personal identifying information should
 
01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
be stricken from any report you know to
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
protect personal information i
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree with you and and if and
 
01:03:38.109 --> 01:03:38.119 align:start position:0%
if your point is that a level of
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
confidentiality is required for the
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
commission for the commission to have
 
01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.270 align:start position:0%
commission for the commission to have
conversations

01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
uh without worrying about discovery i i
 
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm okay with that too i i just i i
 
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
don't think they need to be talking
 
01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:52.549 align:start position:0%
don't think they need to be talking
about

01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
people they need to be talking about
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
incidents and can i just clarify one
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
thing because this was discussed the
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
report is is going to um through
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
rulemaking going to the commissioner
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
it's not going anywhere else it was just
 
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
the way that we were as opposed to
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
submitting every single incident it was
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
requested by
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
it may have been by the urgent care
 
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
centers to create an annual report but
 
01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:19.039 align:start position:0%
it will be determined we're trying to
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
figure out the components of it um and
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
then it can be submitted annually to the
 
01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:26.799 align:start position:0%
commissioner via making um so that's
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
where the the annual report is probably
 
01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
the right the wrong terminology maybe
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
but um that's what that was intended but
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
i think karen wanted to say something
 
01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:36.710 align:start position:0%
i think karen wanted to say something
well

01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
this wasn't the section that we really
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
worked on but what i've noticed in
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
reading this is that
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
the information that would identify the
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
patient also must be
 
01:04:45.839 --> 01:04:46.950 align:start position:0%
patient also must be
withheld

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
withheld
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
so if you knew who the brother was that
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
would that could necessarily identify
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
the patient so i think that this may
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
address your concern representative
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
edwards if you look at it i i agree it
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
gets close i'm not sure that it closes
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
it but uh so so it's now 404 and uh uh
 
01:05:05.349 --> 01:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
general gray just walked through the
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
door senator gray excuse me old habits
 
01:05:08.799 --> 01:05:10.710 align:start position:0%
door senator gray excuse me old habits
uh

01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
and and and and and and i just wanted to
 
01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.589 align:start position:0%
and and and and and and i just wanted to
uh

01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
right before you came in sir i intended
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
to close the discussion on the bill that
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
brought you here um but we'll keep it
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
going for another five ten minutes if
 
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
you'd like to talk to us we have other
 
01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
people here to talk about the next bill
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
that have been waiting patiently for an
 
01:05:31.119 --> 01:05:32.710 align:start position:0%
that have been waiting patiently for an
hour

01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
hour
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
my my goal in having you can sit down
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
and use that mic or where whatever you
 
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
want to do uh mr chair it won't take
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
long i actually came to see
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative dean
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
so i didn't come to testify in the bill
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
and i don't uh care to at this time
 
01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
okay and i'm gonna take you up on your
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
offer to give you a call later senator
 
01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.510 align:start position:0%
offer to give you a call later senator
gray

01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
gray
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
i got your phone number now so um
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
okay so what was the point of this last
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
hour the point of this last hour
 
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
is that i i i
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
i have some concerns and hopefully those
 
01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
concerns are shared by other members of
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
of this committee now that we've had a
 
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
chance to talk about them that i wanted
 
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
to expose because um the the we only
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
have monday and tuesday to finish this
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
committee's work before we have to pass
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
it to the full finance committee
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
so over the weekend i'm going to be
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
playing with an amendment that to me
 
01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:32.799 align:start position:0%
preserves the policy aspect of it but
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
does it in a respectful way of all of
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
the parties involved meaning i'm not
 
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
going to threaten them with
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
penalties if they don't if they choose
 
01:06:43.829 --> 01:06:43.839 align:start position:0%
not to comply
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
and and i i will share that with you
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
obviously and and we'll have another
 
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to discuss it maybe monday
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
or tuesday but but at that point the
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
difference between this discussion and
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
that one would be you would at least be
 
01:06:59.829 --> 01:06:59.839 align:start position:0%
able to see the words and say here on
 
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
page four you really screwed up so so
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
we'll get out of the generalities and
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
into the specifics
 
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
so um is is that is that
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
can you guys come back for that
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
definitely okay all right uh and before
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
we close uh representative nordron do
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
you have something thank you so can you
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
just clarify what you said
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
i guess one of my concerns
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
in the whole discussion is
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
the difference between making this
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
mandatory or voluntary and i and i think
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's something we really need to
 
01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.470 align:start position:0%
that's something we really need to
settle

01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
settle
 
01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:37.829 align:start position:0%
settle
um

01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
before we get too much further down the
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
road with this and bringing in
 
01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:43.270 align:start position:0%
road with this and bringing in
amendments

01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
specifically i think
 
01:07:45.359 --> 01:07:46.150 align:start position:0%
specifically i think
it

01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:48.799 align:start position:0%
would be a disservice to workers
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
if we weren't consistent and uniform
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
across the board
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
when we're trying to implement this so i
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
think that's really an important point
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
for the whole bill on whether or not
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's voluntary
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
or mandatory
 
01:08:07.589 --> 01:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
so you're making an argument for it
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
being mandatory and coercive which is
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
fine we can we can have that discussion
 
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
i'm just suggesting that at this point
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
let's wrap this conversation up go to
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
459 knowing that we're going to have
 
01:08:19.199 --> 01:08:20.309 align:start position:0%
459 knowing that we're going to have
another

01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
458 excuse me knowing that we're going
 
01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
to have another conversation with
 
01:08:24.319 --> 01:08:25.510 align:start position:0%
to have another conversation with
something

01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
in front of us
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
next week i i just still maintain my
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
position that the the cost of this
 
01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:34.470 align:start position:0%
position that the the cost of this
system

01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
goes from a lot to zero
 
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
when we keep it from being mandatory to
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
saying it's voluntary
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
the concern i've heard is that if we
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
make it voluntary we're gonna lose
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh everyone's participation we're gonna
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
lose the data we're going to lose you
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
know the standardization
 
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
and i think that's a challenge but i i
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
think we can get there
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
now i will write something people can
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
look at it and if and if and if i've
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
accidentally killed the patient in the
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
process then then you guys can tell me
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
that next week okay thank you very much
 
01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
mr chair all right
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative walsh real quick i'd
 
01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
like to point out having gone through
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
this build closely why everybody was
 
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
talking that the fines are under a may
 
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
it's the fines are by no means mandatory
 
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:25.759 align:start position:0%
it's that the commissioner of hhs may
 
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
impose the fines and that presumably
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
would be for some sort of egregious
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
offense but it's by no means mandatory
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
fines when people don't comply
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
so i just thought i'd point that out
 
01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
so to that extent i'm happy with it
 
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
i i i i just don't think
 
01:09:45.759 --> 01:09:46.950 align:start position:0%
i i i i just don't think
anyways

01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not a big fan of
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
the state punishing people for uh things
 
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
that should be voluntary that's all
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm just here to protect
 
01:09:58.149 --> 01:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
everyone's rights that's that's why i
 
01:09:59.669 --> 01:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
get up in the morning
 
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
um all right so
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
if there are no other kind represented

01:10:23.199 --> 01:10:24.470 align:start position:0%

replacement secure facility
 
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
senator daniels uh was the prime sponsor
 
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
in the senate and representative rice uh
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored it out of the house
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
children and family law
 
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
there was um
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
this this just got passed yesterday uh
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
and got sent to our committee we have
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
today monday and tuesday to do nothing
 
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
or to do something with this bill
 
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
so so i scheduled this
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
in somewhat in haste
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
because i wanted to at least begin the
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
dialogue so that over the weekend some
 
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
language could maybe be prepared to deal
 
01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
with the big rocks that we see here and
 
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
so that we can have a
 
01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:51.910 align:start position:0%
so that we can have a
complete

01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
complete
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
precise discussion next week but we want
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
to get some things exposed out onto the
 
01:18:57.199 --> 01:18:58.870 align:start position:0%
to get some things exposed out onto the
table

01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
table
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
and i need somebody to
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
help me tee this up so
 
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
senator daniels would you would you mind
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
stepping forward with representative
 
01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
lynn and um
 
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
and then based on uh prior conversations
 
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
i i i think uh i i can help get some
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
things into the record
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh if if your opening statement doesn't
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
get there so relax
 
01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
do you want to tell us about your
 
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
thoughts about what the house amendment
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
did to the original senate bill that has
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
i'm a couple
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
degrees of separation
 
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
from that because they were in the
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
senate i was actually uh
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
looking more toward going toward the
 
01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:50.550 align:start position:0%
looking more toward going toward the
private

01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
private
 
01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:51.830 align:start position:0%
private
uh

01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
housing so
 
01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:55.510 align:start position:0%
housing so
um

01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:58.630 --> 01:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
i think probably uh representative lynn
 
01:19:58.640 --> 01:19:59.510 align:start position:0%
i think probably uh representative lynn
might

01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
have a better perspective as to
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
representative lynn
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
well i guess what what i would say is i
 
01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
mean as as everybody here knows i had a
 
01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:13.910 align:start position:0%
mean as as everybody here knows i had a
uh

01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
i opposed the the uh the part of the
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
bill that my main concern was was with
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
the part of a bill
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
that added the language from
 
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 254
 
01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:27.669 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 254
um

01:20:27.669 --> 01:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
there were um
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
in addition and that you know i i
 
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
oppose that
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
the house did not agree with my position
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
and i then proposed a floor amendment
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
the house did not agree with my position
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
on that either um i
 
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
for purposes of this i will say i i
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
believe that my position was correct and
 
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
i still believe that but the other
 
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
things that the court that the uh
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
that the uh
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
that i think there's a difference
 
01:20:59.110 --> 01:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
between the senate and the house version
 
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill which um
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
might draw a different
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know different
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
reactions for from people are in terms
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
of the size of
 
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
of the facility as i understand that the
 
01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:14.639 align:start position:0%
senate bill was for an 18
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
bed facility
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
and the version that was passed by the
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
house was for a six bed facility
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
i candidly had not focused on that
 
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
particular issue the size of the
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
facility i as i said yesterday i i
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
firmly support the idea of having a new
 
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.270 align:start position:0%
firmly support the idea of having a new
facility

01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
i hadn't particularly focused on the
 
01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:38.149 align:start position:0%
i hadn't particularly focused on the
size

01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
size
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
but i do i do think that
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
that six beds
 
01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
um is
 
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be
 
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
not adequate um it's you know as i
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
understand it and i people who have much
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
more expertise in this in terms of the
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
ongoing things that have happened you
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
know recently
 
01:21:58.870 --> 01:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
but as i understand it
 
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
for at least the last couple of years
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
where there's been a focused effort
 
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
to to have the the sununu center reduced
 
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
sort of the smallest population that is
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
kind of reasonably
 
01:22:15.189 --> 01:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
that that reasonably makes sense
 
01:22:17.189 --> 01:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
um that's been ongoing for a couple of
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
years and as i understand it that has
 
01:22:21.189 --> 01:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
the current population of the sununu
 
01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
center is somewhere between 10 and 15
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
people roughly betw
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
split equally between
 
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
minors who are in pre-trial uh
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
pre-adjudication detention and minors
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
who have been adjudicated
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
that sends would seem to me to suggest
 
01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:40.310 align:start position:0%
that sends would seem to me to suggest
that

01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
it would be very hard to get below that
 
01:22:43.679 --> 01:22:44.629 align:start position:0%
it would be very hard to get below that
number

01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
and so you know having us having a
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
facility that's only six beds
 
01:22:49.679 --> 01:22:50.870 align:start position:0%
facility that's only six beds
um

01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
just doesn't seem to me to make to make
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense um
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
and i don't think and i particularly in
 
01:22:59.430 --> 01:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
light of what
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
i hope
 
01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
other people will be here to say
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
particularly in light of the fact that
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
the change in the the crime the the
 
01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
offenses for which a juvenile can be
 
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.110 align:start position:0%
offenses for which a juvenile can be
committed

01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
committed
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
under uh under the amendment
 
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
under the under 254 as it was amended
 
01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:19.510 align:start position:0%
under the under 254 as it was amended
have

01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
there aren't
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
there are virtually no people that are
 
01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.149 align:start position:0%
there are virtually no people that are
committed

01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
committed
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
to to sununu now
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
that that you know would be excluded
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
under this uh
 
01:23:34.149 --> 01:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
under the amendment so that's not the if
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
the thought is that that's somehow going
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
to reduce the population of the sununu
 
01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
center it just doesn't seem to me it is
 
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
factually accurate so that's so let me
 
01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:44.719 align:start position:0%
let me let me just restate that because
 
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
i i think that's a critical point
 
01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
that the amendment
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh attempted to bring in the provisions
 
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 254
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
which were
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
restrictions on what type of cases for
 
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
which a juvenile was was found guilty of
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
the it restricted the the cases
 
01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
for which they could they might be
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
incarcerated with the idea that by doing
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
that they would end up
 
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
directly being able to reduce the census
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
at the sununu center
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
and that based on a review of the data
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
at dcyf
 
01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.390 align:start position:0%
at dcyf
[Music]

01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
even with
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
had the full provisions the restrictions
 
01:24:34.629 --> 01:24:34.639 align:start position:0%
of 254 been in place
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
it would not have affected the census it
 
01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
would not have reduced the census is is
 
01:24:41.189 --> 01:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
that your is that
 
01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding it's my
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
understanding and mr ribson i think
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
would be much more you know which could
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
give you much more accurate but it is my
 
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
understanding for example
 
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
that there is nobody that is
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
incarcerated at uh or detained i mean
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
committed or even detained at the sununu
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
center for only a property crime where
 
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
the person doesn't prevent doesn't
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
present any any danger of of uh of
 
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
personal injury and that there is that
 
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
there isn't anybody and i think with
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
maybe very rare exceptions that mr
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
ripson can talk about there isn't
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
anybody that has been committed to the
 
01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
sununu center for only a misdemeanor
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
where they don't have three prior
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors there isn't anybody that
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
that um that has been uh committed there
 
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
for that and i think it's pretty rare as
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
i understand it even for the three
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
strikes uh person to be committed there
 
01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
but mr ripson can talk about that
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
do you have anything else to add to that
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh i do not no thank you okay um
 
01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
mr ripson could you could you come up
 
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
and wait
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
wait wait wait wait sorry are there
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you mr chairman senator
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
daniels i wonder if you might
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
just take a moment
 
01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
to speak to your original bill
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
which as i understand it
 
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
was a privately run operation and speak
 
01:26:04.149 --> 01:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
to how that
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:09.669 --> 01:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
and i think in light of the discussions
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
that have taken place later where some
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
people believe the number should be six
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
some people believe it should be twelve
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
some people believe it should be
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
eighteen uh going the private route with
 
01:26:20.639 --> 01:26:21.830 align:start position:0%
eighteen uh going the private route with
existing

01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
existing
 
01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
facilities already out there gives you a
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
flexibility that you don't have to try
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
to guess what the right size
 
01:26:31.110 --> 01:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
in building a new facility
 
01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
is so i think you've got that ability to
 
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
just pay for the people who are actually
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
there if that happens to be six if it if
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
it fluctuates up to 18 you do that but
 
01:26:45.030 --> 01:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
you're paying for what you have as
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to building something and
 
01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
maybe have it two-thirds empty
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
or maybe have it full
 
01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
jeremy i had just one other thing before
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
you which i hope you'll ask mr ribson
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
about because
 
01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
you raised a question on the floor
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
yesterday i think is really a very
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
critical point here and that is
 
01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
what are the potential unintended
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
consequences of the 254
 
01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
in terms and i think it does that this
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
could potentially have cost implications
 
01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.270 align:start position:0%
could potentially have cost implications
because

01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
and one of the consequences it seems to
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
me is by removing the option
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
of potentially treating
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
some serious property offender as a as a
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
as a minor through the juvenile justice
 
01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:33.830 align:start position:0%
as a minor through the juvenile justice
system

01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:27:36.629 --> 01:27:36.639 align:start position:0%
you raise the potential that a that you
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
know in some cases some cases some
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
prosecutors gonna say
 
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
this kid needs to be committed for some
 
01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
period of time and if i don't have the
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
option of of going through the juvenile
 
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
system my only option is to petition to
 
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
have this this minor treated as an adult
 
01:27:57.990 --> 01:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
um because then then he can be committed
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
of course the commitment then at least
 
01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
until the person was 18 would be back at
 
01:28:05.110 --> 01:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
the at the sununu center but but the
 
01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:05.910 align:start position:0%
the at the sununu center but but the
that

01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
that would then not be subject to
 
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
the 254. i think that's a real
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
possibility that something like that
 
01:28:14.310 --> 01:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
could happen and i don't think anybody
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
certainly not me wants wants to you know
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
wants that to happen where somebody
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
could be treated through the juvenile
 
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
representative irf
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair just to follow up at
 
01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
that point so if somebody was
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
being tried as an adult could they also
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
be held at an adult prison under current
 
01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
law my my understanding and i asked
 
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
mr ribson to correct me because i
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
haven't dealt with this
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
in a couple of years but my
 
01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
understanding is
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
they that 18
 
01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:54.870 align:start position:0%
they that 18
whether

01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
whether it's mandatory that that's where
 
01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
they be held or whether there is some
 
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
discretion either with the court or with
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
dcyf or the
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
dcyf or the or the department of
 
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
corrections to make that decision i'm
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
not positive of that frankly because i
 
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
just haven't dealt with in a while thank
 
01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:14.310 align:start position:0%
just haven't dealt with in a while thank
you

01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
let me finish on this uh
 
01:29:19.030 --> 01:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
oh you i thought i did too but you go
 
01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:20.470 align:start position:0%
oh you i thought i did too but you go
ahead

01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
i was going to talk about priya is that
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
what you're going to talk about the
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
prison rape elimination act i was going
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
to use the acronym that i was going to
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
talk about the federal law that requires
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
the separation of juveniles and adults
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
well go right ahead i wasn't sure
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
anybody else was familiar with it
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
you're the attorney go for it um
 
01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:39.510 align:start position:0%
you're the attorney go for it um
so

01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:41.189 --> 01:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
quite a number of years ago probably
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
more than a decade congress passed a law
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
called the prison rape elimination act
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
priya as it was known they chose not to
 
01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
enforce it for a long time
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
eventually they decided to start
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
enforcing it and at that point new
 
01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire and a bill that i was uh
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
shepherding through the legislature um
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
chose to raise the age of adulthood from
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
17 to 18. you probably represented
 
01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
i do remember that and and pre was
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
honestly the reason it happened because
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
under priya you cannot house
 
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
people under the age of 18 in the same
 
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
area as anybody as any adult in other
 
01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
words 18 and over okay and so what it
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
was practically going to mean is every
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
one of the county jails and the state
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
prison was going to have to build
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
separate facilities
 
01:30:25.679 --> 01:30:26.790 align:start position:0%
separate facilities
for

01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
17 year olds being treated as adults but
 
01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
being held in adult facilities and
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
everybody recognized that that was not a
 
01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
wise use of money to build 11 new
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
separate facilities around the state so
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
we were able to get through the bill
 
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
that raised the age to 18 to stop that
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
so when you have somebody now certified
 
01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
as an adult they still cannot be held
 
01:30:50.709 --> 01:30:50.719 align:start position:0%
with other adults in the prison that's
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
federal law that prohibits that so that
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's the answer to your question um
 
01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
along the way is that
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
they can be held in the state prison but
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
they would have to have a facility where
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
they're totally isolated from adults um
 
01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's not the building it's the exposure
 
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
to adults that that is limited
 
01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
oh thank you for that i just i you know
 
01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
i hadn't dealt with that
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
recently for sure and i'm not sure i
 
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
have ever actually had a case that
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
raised that issue but i had a lot of
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with it so that's why i chose to
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
all right if there are no other
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
questions from the reps uh we'll bring
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
and and while you're walking up um
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
it it's my understanding of the history
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
we've known for a long time that we have
 
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
that we in retrospect overbuilt the
 
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
sununu center and
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh and that
 
01:31:50.629 --> 01:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
as a result of the sprawling complex
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
that we were spending more money than we
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
really needed to and what was productive
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
01:31:58.560 --> 01:31:59.750 align:start position:0%
and so um
so

01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
while the legislator
 
01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
legislature was dealing with it uh the
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
department also dealt with it and you
 
01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
brought in a consultant uh alvarez and
 
01:32:13.830 --> 01:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
there's an m there marcel i keep wanting
 
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
to say martinez but i'm sure i'd get
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
drug away for racism or something if i
 
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
did that marcel
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
so alvarez and marcel
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
and they
 
01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
looked at all of the census data
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
and kind of independently applied their
 
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
consulting hat to it and they came up
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
with a recommendation of 18
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
as i understand it and that the
 
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
department has since verified looking at
 
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
their data and and kind of thinking of
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
it on their own that 18 is sort of the
 
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
the smallest
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
capacity you could you could try to work
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
with and that and then to take that one
 
01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
step further there's absolutely no data
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
to suggest that six is a good number
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
now with that introduction uh
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
once you respond to that and then
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
whatever else you want to about this
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
bill sure thank you representative
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
edwards uh good afternoon members of the
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
committee joe ripson director of dcyf um
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
yes the department
 
01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
um commissioned last you know last year
 
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
when we're going through this budget
 
01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
process and this conversation was
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
happening and
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
the decision was made to commission uh
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
alvarez marcel to work with us and a
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
group it was actually a work group that
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
included some members of the legislature
 
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
included some stakeholders
 
01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
included some of the advocacy community
 
01:33:36.629 --> 01:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
to come up with recommendations and the
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
final recommendation that came out of
 
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
that report was to
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
build a 18 bed facility the number 18
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
was based on the data of what we
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
currently see today and i don't have the
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
data with me today but i can bring it
 
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
next week if folks would like to see it
 
01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
which shows what the average daily
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
census has been now the census has
 
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
dropped radically over the years right
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
we had when i first moved to this state
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
four and a half years ago there was some
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
days where you had 75 kids in that
 
01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:03.270 align:start position:0%
days where you had 75 kids in that
building

01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
today the average daily census is about
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
12 but that is an average daily census
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
it bounces between about 8 and 16 new
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire kids and i do want to clarify
 
01:34:13.110 --> 01:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
that i'm only talking about the kids
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
that are there under new hampshire law
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
we do have a contract with vermont to
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
serve some of those kids we exclude
 
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
those kids from the data because we were
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
asked very early on from folks to make
 
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
sure that we weren't counting those kids
 
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of this conversation so
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
all the data we shared does not include
 
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
and we have within that building that
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
those 18 beds that we think that we need
 
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
have to really be able to be structured
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
in a way to serve three discrete
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
populations that sometimes need to be
 
01:34:40.149 --> 01:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
separated from each other
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
so we have females in that building as
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
well as males and same thing in the
 
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
future state
 
01:34:47.109 --> 01:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
over the last two years looking at the
 
01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
data based on a question representative
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
earth sent me earlier i took a closer
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
look than i had before so i appreciated
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
his questions
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
at the peak we've had seven females in
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
that building in the past two years at
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
one on one given day
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
so the most females you'd have on a day
 
01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
is about seven based on the last two
 
01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
years worth of data we've had days where
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
i think it was 14 or 15 males in the
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
facility on one given day now we've not
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
had that happen at once where you had 21
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
kids in the building at once in the last
 
01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:16.159 align:start position:0%
two years it's happened that you had
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
less females more males it's played out
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
to be around a daily i said average of
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
12 but could be at its peak 15 to 16
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:30.149 --> 01:35:30.159 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to separate those
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
populations though which is why even
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
though we only presume an average daily
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
census of 12 you do need to have some
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
additional beds in the building
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
females have to be kept separately so
 
01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
you need to have a space that can hold
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
your maximum capacity of females
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
and then your males it's not uncommon
 
01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
that they have to be separated we
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
actually try to have them all in one
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
unit when we can but it's not uncommon
 
01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
for us to get a court order requiring
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
that two males be separated because
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
they've been involved in some type of
 
01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:54.870 align:start position:0%
they've been involved in some type of
common

01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
common
 
01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
activity outside and the court wants
 
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:57.679 align:start position:0%
them separated when they're within the
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
building because they don't want them
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
talking to each other about whatever
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
common activities they were in or where
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
you have treatment needs of kids that
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
are such that they can't be together
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
safely or where you know two guys just
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
can't be together and part of our job
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
with them is to work with them through
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
that but that doesn't happen instantly
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
and having them in one housing unit's
 
01:36:15.109 --> 01:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
not safe
 
01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
so that's why we get to the number of 18
 
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
to give us some flexibility in how we
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
use our different units
 
01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:21.669 align:start position:0%
use our different units
um

01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
even though the average daily sense we
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
presume is 12.
 
01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of i'm sorry
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
i think i think
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
there's also a fourth category of
 
01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
needing to keep them separated is as i
 
01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:36.390 align:start position:0%
needing to keep them separated is as i
understand

01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
gang activities that take place in that
 
01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh separating gangs in an incarceration
 
01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
setting is essential for maintaining
 
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
safety that that you don't want to have
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
opposing gang members co-located yeah
 
01:36:54.229 --> 01:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
you know and i think it's um
 
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
so it's interesting because most of the
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
gang activity you see here are more like
 
01:36:58.629 --> 01:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
kind of smaller organizations it's
 
01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
fortunate we don't have a lot of the
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
kids involved in kind of national gangs
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
but you do see kind of smaller
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
um smaller kind of street organizations
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
of kids and in fact you know we will try
 
01:37:10.709 --> 01:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
to to help remediate those situations
 
01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:12.159 align:start position:0%
and eventually allow those kids to
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
actually be together in one unit too but
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's a circumstance where when if two
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
kids come in from the outside they were
 
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
going to be at each other's throats that
 
01:37:20.229 --> 01:37:20.239 align:start position:0%
you don't want to put them together
 
01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:21.679 align:start position:0%
immediately until you actually have the
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
chance to do some restorative justice
 
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
work with those kids and get them you
 
01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
know in a place where they can be
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
together in one one one's place which is
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
one of our goals one of the things we
 
01:37:31.270 --> 01:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
try to do when those situations come up
 
01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:32.070 align:start position:0%
try to do when those situations come up
um

01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and then you know the the
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
populations as we heard before right
 
01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:37.030 align:start position:0%
populations as we heard before right
um

01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
that are served there it's all detained
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
kids so those are kids who are pre-trial
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
um a lot of times detained kids might
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
only be there for a couple days and then
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
the court will release them to some type
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
of shelter program or or back to the
 
01:37:48.719 --> 01:37:49.750 align:start position:0%
of shelter program or or back to the
community

01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
but they could be there sometimes for an
 
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
extended period of time if they're
 
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
pending adult charges they could be
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
there for months and months and months
 
01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
and if they're ultimately
 
01:37:59.910 --> 01:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
found guilty on those adult charges
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
they'll remain with us until they turn
 
01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:02.390 align:start position:0%
they'll remain with us until they turn
18.

01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
18.
 
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
your committed population on the other
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
hand those are the kids who have been
 
01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
adjudicated by the court they typically
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
only spend about three months in the
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
facility unless it's a particularly
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
egregious crime then it might be six
 
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
months but typically
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
typically your committed population is
 
01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
there for a relatively short time your
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
detained population is there for
 
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
typically a couple weeks but like i said
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
that could be a lot longer and for some
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
kids who are pending adult charges it
 
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
could be years that they're in there and
 
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
that that detained status
 
01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
fortunately what we see today in new
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire is very limited use of adult
 
01:38:35.189 --> 01:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
charges for kids
 
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
the of those that i can remember the
 
01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
only cases that i remember of kids
 
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
having adult charges have been for
 
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
murder and attempted murder since of
 
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
those i can recall it's pretty unusual
 
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
that leads me to some of my concerns
 
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
though that i heard in the prior
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
conversation uh when judge lynn was on
 
01:38:53.590 --> 01:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
up here around 254 and the potential
 
01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
that when you change those rules you
 
01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
potentially change the behavior of
 
01:38:59.669 --> 01:38:59.679 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and judges
 
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
if our prosecutors and judges don't
 
01:39:02.709 --> 01:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
think they can keep the community safe
 
01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
with the rules they're going to find the
 
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
other rules that would allow them to do
 
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
so and i think that's exactly what you
 
01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:09.679 align:start position:0%
were hearing judge lynn express a
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
concern that um some of the we don't
 
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
know what the outcome of these changes
 
01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
are going to be and it actually could
 
01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
result in more kids being charged as
 
01:39:19.350 --> 01:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
adults and therefore result in more kids
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
spending more time at the facility even
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
though it might not be in their best
 
01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:23.350 align:start position:0%
though it might not be in their best
interest

01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
so i you know i do
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
i do um recommend caution when thinking
 
01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:28.550 align:start position:0%
i do um recommend caution when thinking
about

01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
those provisions uh being added to this
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
bill um you know 254 already passed the
 
01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
house it's in the senate it's being
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
considered there
 
01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:36.870 align:start position:0%
considered there
um

01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
but we're not sure what that bill is
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
going to do to the census i know some
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
people believe it's going to drastically
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
reduce the census
 
01:39:44.709 --> 01:39:44.719 align:start position:0%
until i see that happen i'm not going to
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
believe it because what 254 has done is
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
it's yes
 
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
so do you know
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh for sure that hb 254 is is in the
 
01:39:57.109 --> 01:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
senate and has not been voted on by the
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
whole senate
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know for sure what the posture
 
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
is in the whole senate i see mr dejoy
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
nodding his head you know that to be
 
01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:07.510 align:start position:0%
nodding his head you know that to be
true

01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
it's in committee it's not been voted
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
out by the senate okay but it's an it's
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
an active bill good good okay that's
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
what i'm looking for thanks yeah it's an
 
01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
active bill in the senate
 
01:40:17.199 --> 01:40:18.229 align:start position:0%
active bill in the senate
um

01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
again what i say is that what's
 
01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:22.159 align:start position:0%
uncertain about it is 254 has kind of
 
01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
changed the rules it's limited the types
 
01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
of first-time offenses that could come
 
01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
in but it also created a new exception
 
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
looking at kind of community safety
 
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
risk of bodily injury and that's a new
 
01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:34.639 align:start position:0%
kind of standard or loophole that hasn't
 
01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
been applied in the past the kind of old
 
01:40:38.229 --> 01:40:38.239 align:start position:0%
way that under the current law that that
 
01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
gets addressed is the uh kind of three
 
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
strikes you're out for lesser offenses
 
01:40:45.189 --> 01:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
um provision so swapping from one kind
 
01:40:45.199 --> 01:40:45.990 align:start position:0%
um provision so swapping from one kind
of

01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
pathway to let kids use the juve let
 
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
judges and prosecutors have the juvenile
 
01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:52.639 align:start position:0%
system as an option to another pathway
 
01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
um this new one in 254 i don't know that
 
01:40:56.709 --> 01:40:56.719 align:start position:0%
that's going to result in less kids it
 
01:40:59.109 --> 01:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
could result in more kids um
 
01:41:00.629 --> 01:41:00.639 align:start position:0%
so i you know i think it's a really
 
01:41:03.189 --> 01:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
risky proposition to look at that as a
 
01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
policy and for us to without any data to
 
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
evaluate it just assume it's going to
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
drive the census down to a number that
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
has never been seen before and i you
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
know i've heard some people make
 
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
arguments that if we build it to 18 that
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
the state's going to fill it i think the
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
the counter point that i would make to
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
that is we have a facility for 144 today
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
and we have you know on average 12. so
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to fill that facility i
 
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
think the the system has changed
 
01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
dramatically in the last few years to
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
try to minimize the use of a facility
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:33.350 align:start position:0%
like that
but

01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:34.310 align:start position:0%
but
um

01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
but that it when we have those
 
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
situations where we need to keep the
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
community safe there needs to be some
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
place to use
 
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
so would you believe that i in the
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
conversation i had with the chairman of
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
the judiciary representative gordon
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
about this that he said that
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's his understanding that the the
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
judges of new hampshire have actively
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
over a five-year period of time been
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
much more careful about ensuring that
 
01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
only the kids that needed to go to
 
01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
sununu went to sununu would you would
 
01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
you believe that
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and i think it's there's there's a
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
number of changes over the past five
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
years so there's multiple things that
 
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
have led to this result of a reduced
 
01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
census right we have changes in law
 
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
offenses that can be
 
01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
referred to sununu you've had changes in
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
practice amongst judges and prosecutors
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
largely driven by leadership in the in
 
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
the in the courts right judge kelly
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
previously and judge ashley today really
 
01:42:29.430 --> 01:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
focused on this issue
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
changes within
 
01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
our dcyf's juvenile probations thinking
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
about the use of this facility the
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
creation of a system of care and
 
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
different out different in-home options
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
for kids and different residential
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
options for kids it did not exist five
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
years ago and i think in constellation
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
those things are what have driven
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
thankfully the census down um but
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
you know what change another you know
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
what change 254 is going to make is
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
something that i'm just not comfortable
 
01:42:56.709 --> 01:42:56.719 align:start position:0%
predicting i think it's a risky
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
proposition for us to
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
to just have faith that somehow it's
 
01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:02.719 align:start position:0%
going to achieve a result that we're not
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
i have no evidence of
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
and and it sounds like you you indicated
 
01:43:10.229 --> 01:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
that we may actually end up with a an
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
adverse twist is that if if
 
01:43:16.629 --> 01:43:16.639 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't look like a kid can be
 
01:43:19.590 --> 01:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
incarcerated under the juvenile code
 
01:43:23.189 --> 01:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
that may incline the judge to go with a
 
01:43:24.870 --> 01:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
criminal uh
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
prosecution which
 
01:43:30.149 --> 01:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
then creates a permanent record for that
 
01:43:30.159 --> 01:43:31.030 align:start position:0%
then creates a permanent record for that
youth

01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
youth
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
and still they end up in sununu we so we
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
didn't save anything on the sununu side
 
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
and we might actually end up with a kid
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
having a much longer sentence by going
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
through the adult side before they got
 
01:43:46.149 --> 01:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
to sununu so this could this could be
 
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
like a double backfire
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
is that is that a fair summary of what
 
01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
you said yeah i agree i think there's a
 
01:43:55.590 --> 01:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative irf
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr ribson for taking my
 
01:44:02.709 --> 01:44:02.719 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned the system of
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
care i wonder if you could speak to how
 
01:44:06.870 --> 01:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
that is impacting that investment that
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
the state has been making over the past
 
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
years and is currently in the com in the
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
current biennium how that's impacting
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
the census currently and how it might
 
01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
impact it uh in the future
 
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so there's there's there are
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
so many changes that have happened to
 
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
the child and family serving system over
 
01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
the past four years that it's hard to
 
01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
talk about concisely but i'll i'll try
 
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about the system of care
 
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
really we're specifically talking about
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
children's behavioral health services
 
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
which work alongside of but not within
 
01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
dcyf right so historically dcyf
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
basically was the de facto children's
 
01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
behavioral health system there was
 
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
nowhere for a kid or family to turn to
 
01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
have their needs met without coming into
 
01:44:44.229 --> 01:44:44.239 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice or child protection
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
which doesn't make sense if kids have
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
behavioral health needs families should
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
be able to drive their care and get
 
01:44:49.590 --> 01:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
access to care and that's what the
 
01:44:52.229 --> 01:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
system of care in the big picture does
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
now the way that it's done that was you
 
01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
know the key ways that it's done that
 
01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
was creating a couple key programs one
 
01:44:58.950 --> 01:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
of them something that we call fast
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
forward which is a high fidelity
 
01:45:02.310 --> 01:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
wraparound program for kids and their
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
families to to kind of
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
help guide through
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
through the behavioral health needs of
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
the child connect them to in-home
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
supports peer supports and same thing
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
with the family
 
01:45:16.149 --> 01:45:16.159 align:start position:0%
that service you know five years ago
 
01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
didn't exist
 
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
three years ago served 60 kids today
 
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
serving over 500 kids
 
01:45:23.669 --> 01:45:23.679 align:start position:0%
that service i think has had a lot a lot
 
01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
to do with the fact that we have less
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
kids not just at sysc but less kids on
 
01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
probation right it's not just about sysc
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
which is the deepest end of the system a
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
service like that impacts the entire
 
01:45:35.910 --> 01:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice system right all those
 
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
kids on probation
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
um and there used to be thousands of
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
those kids and now it's into the
 
01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
hundreds um when i say used to i'm
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
years and years ago not five years ago
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
10 20 years ago
 
01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:49.350 align:start position:0%
10 20 years ago
um

01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
the other services that go along with it
 
01:45:53.189 --> 01:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
are things that we at dcyf haven't been
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
doing to align with what's called the
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
family first services prevention act
 
01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:00.470 align:start position:0%
family first services prevention act
which

01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
included us moving to different
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
evidence-based models of care
 
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
so we have two that we've procured have
 
01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
gotten contracts for got gnc approval
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
for and are currently running we have
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
three more that we're working on but the
 
01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
two that are currently live and running
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
are multi-systemic therapy which is
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
really specifically targeted for working
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
for high-risk juvenile population
 
01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
kids with the types of behaviors that we
 
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
see within the juvenile justice system
 
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
and works very closely with that kid
 
01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
their family and their community
 
01:46:28.470 --> 01:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
to try to keep that kid safe in their
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
community and out of residential inclu
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
programs including sysc
 
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
and then the other one that we have live
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
today is called intercept that was a
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
little more focused on the parent side
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
of that equation so it typically is used
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
more in child protection but is
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes used in juvenile justice but
 
01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
those things have both
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
those things in concert with the system
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
of care driving down the need for
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
high-end facilities like sysc or
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
residential care for kids and that's why
 
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
it's so important you build out those
 
01:46:56.229 --> 01:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
community services what i would say the
 
01:46:57.270 --> 01:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
second part of your question was where
 
01:46:58.310 --> 01:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
do you think where do i think that's
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
going to lead it in the long run i do
 
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
think that could lead to an even further
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
reduced census
 
01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
but when i say long run i want to be
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
careful i'm not saying in the next one
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
or two years it could help in the next
 
01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
one or two years when it really helps is
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
when the current crop of 10 year olds
 
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
have had access to that service as 12
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
year olds and don't end up the way that
 
01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
our 17 year olds are today that are
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
showing up at sysc right so you're
 
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
talking about kind of the next crop of
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
kids benefiting from preventative early
 
01:47:24.790 --> 01:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
services not getting as deep in the
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
system that's not where we are today the
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
kids who are there today didn't have the
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
benefit of that system
 
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
so i do think it will continue to drive
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
the numbers down i just i just don't
 
01:47:35.430 --> 01:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
think we can really say that it's going
 
01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
to drive the numbers down in the
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned two new programs or
 
01:47:45.189 --> 01:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
relatively new programs
 
01:47:47.109 --> 01:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
what what what are the age of those
 
01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
programs and and how mature do you think
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
they are and what sort of uh
 
01:47:53.669 --> 01:47:53.679 align:start position:0%
information are you getting from them
 
01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
that give you confidence and sort of the
 
01:47:58.149 --> 01:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
predictive your predictive ability from
 
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
them so those two that i mentioned are
 
01:48:01.669 --> 01:48:01.679 align:start position:0%
relatively new to new hampshire they've
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
both been live in this state only since
 
01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
mst started serving families in january
 
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
and the current i'm sorry in december
 
01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
and the current iteration of intercepts
 
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
only started serving families in january
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
so i don't think we're seeing anything
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
in those numbers where my where my faith
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
in them comes from is the research
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
behind them and the way that they've
 
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
been used in jurisdictions around the
 
01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
country proving to have results in these
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
areas so i believe that they're going to
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
have those impacts but they're not yet
 
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
where i think we are seeing impacts
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
today from the system of care is that
 
01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
fast forward program that i spoke about
 
01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
which has been serving kids now for
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
about you know
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
i think first started about four-ish
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:48:38.950 --> 01:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
like i said only serving 60 and today
 
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have do you have any
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
general come i i don't know if you've
 
01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
had a chance to take a look at the bill
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
as amended by the house yesterday but uh
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
in the off chance that you have do you
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
have any other general comments you'd
 
01:48:57.189 --> 01:48:57.199 align:start position:0%
like to make and then i'd like to invite
 
01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
the other representatives to ask you
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
questions as well
 
01:49:02.709 --> 01:49:02.719 align:start position:0%
uh no no other comments i mean i think
 
01:49:02.719 --> 01:49:03.669 align:start position:0%
uh no no other comments i mean i think
the

01:49:03.669 --> 01:49:03.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:05.350 --> 01:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
the bill as a as it came over from the
 
01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
senate was
 
01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
we we thought was in pretty good shape
 
01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
um you know i think the change in the
 
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
the change in the number as we already
 
01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
spoke about is something that concerns
 
01:49:13.599 --> 01:49:14.390 align:start position:0%
spoke about is something that concerns
me

01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
um and the addition of 254 is something
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
that i just i'm not sure what the impact
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
is going to be on sy on the operation of
 
01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
a future facility so i you know it just
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
adds it adds uncertainty into the
 
01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
equation when we think about building a
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
new a news a new new facility
 
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you are there questions
 
01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
representative walls
 
01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:49:37.679 --> 01:49:38.550 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
so

01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
the house established the policy
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
yesterday the six bed policy and despite
 
01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:43.589 align:start position:0%
yesterday the six bed policy and despite
what

01:49:43.589 --> 01:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:49:46.149 --> 01:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
mr ripson may want that is the policy of
 
01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
the house and we are not a policy
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
committee so we are supposed to be
 
01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:51.679 align:start position:0%
addressing the policy passed by the
 
01:49:51.679 --> 01:49:52.709 align:start position:0%
addressing the policy passed by the
house

01:49:52.709 --> 01:49:52.719 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:49:54.790 --> 01:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
so i noticed that the fiscal note on
 
01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
this was drafted to deal with an 18 bed
 
01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
facility and i'm wondering if we can ask
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
mr ribson's office or whoever does this
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
to draft the fiscal note on a six-bed
 
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
facility because that is the policy of
 
01:50:08.790 --> 01:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
the house and that's what this committee
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
should be looking at and and it seems to
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
me that we're not gonna we're gonna have
 
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
a hard time doing our job if the only
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is on a facility that is not
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:22.629 --> 01:50:22.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh are there any other questions
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
mr chairman that was a request to you to
 
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
make that request of mr ripson so that
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
we have the information we need to do
 
01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
you you based it on on a premise that i
 
01:50:40.229 --> 01:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
don't agree with though
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
the premise is that
 
01:50:44.709 --> 01:50:44.719 align:start position:0%
by by looking at the issues of the
 
01:50:48.229 --> 01:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
insertion of 254 and the change of
 
01:50:51.589 --> 01:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
capacity from 18 to 6 that those are
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
policy issues that we should not be
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with but i i think
 
01:50:56.880 --> 01:50:58.310 align:start position:0%
dealing with but i i think
intrinsically

01:50:58.310 --> 01:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
intrinsically
 
01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
those have cost implications because of
 
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
the way that the whole system would
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
operate under one scenario of the future
 
01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
versus another and so i i i don't feel
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
as constrained about
 
01:51:16.470 --> 01:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
the policy limitations that that i think
 
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
you would have us
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
impose on ourselves
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
i i i i'm more comfortable dealing with
 
01:51:26.070 --> 01:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
the policy because the policy
 
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
establishes the operations and the
 
01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:30.390 align:start position:0%
establishes the operations and the
effectiveness

01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
effectiveness
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
and to me
 
01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
that that gets into
 
01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
efficiency and effectiveness which are
 
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
financial issues i'm
 
01:51:39.589 --> 01:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
i know you can disagree with me and then
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
you probably do so would you would you
 
01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
would you please just
 
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
make your request directly to mr ribson
 
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
because i i don't want any part of it
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to mr ribson given that
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
that is the official policy the house as
 
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
of yesterday so that the finance
 
01:51:57.189 --> 01:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
committee has accurate information that
 
01:51:59.189 --> 01:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
they can deal with all possibilities not
 
01:52:01.589 --> 01:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
just the cost of an 18 bed facility but
 
01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
the cost of a sixty six bed facility and
 
01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
the cost possibly of a facility where we
 
01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
rehab an existing building which can be
 
01:52:11.109 --> 01:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
done inexpensively and quickly and i
 
01:52:14.229 --> 01:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
point to the fact that i know on the
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
gallon campus the old state hospital
 
01:52:17.910 --> 01:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
campus there's that road if you're
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
facing it from pleasant street there's
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
that row of large houses along there in
 
01:52:22.470 --> 01:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
fact one of them just burned a week or
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
two ago
 
01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
although not badly because i actually
 
01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
looked at it um and
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
something like that that we may already
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
own that is near the state hospital
 
01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
where the the therapists that these
 
01:52:35.109 --> 01:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
children would need would be right there
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
on the same campus with them you know
 
01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
that's something that i believe the
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
state should be considering is something
 
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
like that where concord highs right down
 
01:52:45.270 --> 01:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
the road the therapists are right there
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
we've got the buildings on campus i
 
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
don't know what the current use of them
 
01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
but i know at least one of them was
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
under rehab and i'm wondering if there's
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
that or even building a new facility if
 
01:52:56.950 --> 01:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
we can have for the finance committee
 
01:52:58.950 --> 01:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
the fiscal notes on what it would mean
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
to rehab or to build a six-bed facility
 
01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:03.109 align:start position:0%
to rehab or to build a six-bed facility
and

01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:05.109 --> 01:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
i i'm not alone on this i've had
 
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
discussions with other members of the
 
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
finance committee that would like that
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
information so that we have all the
 
01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
information that we need to make an
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate decision next week
 
01:53:16.950 --> 01:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i think the the challenge is simply
 
01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
the timing right we were we were we had
 
01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
worked with a legislative committee um
 
01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
in the fall
 
01:53:25.350 --> 01:53:25.360 align:start position:0%
worked with das to come up with the
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
estimate of building a facility that was
 
01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
18 beds because that's what the
 
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
conversation was at that moment the
 
01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
conversation today has shifted but the
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
process of actually doing that type of
 
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
analysis isn't going to be something
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's going to happen over this weekend
 
01:53:38.950 --> 01:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
and it's not something that dcyf is
 
01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
actually even capable of doing we'd have
 
01:53:41.589 --> 01:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
to partner with
 
01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
administrative services to do that work
 
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
well is it possible to make that request
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
of dis to even give us a back of the
 
01:53:50.310 --> 01:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
envelope so that we're not looking at
 
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
this totally blindly
 
01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:55.030 align:start position:0%
this totally blindly
certainly

01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:57.189 --> 01:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
to just mr ripple because i think the
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
lba is essentially responsible for
 
01:54:01.109 --> 01:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes and we're kind of stomping
 
01:54:03.430 --> 01:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
around in his turf i'm good with that i
 
01:54:05.669 --> 01:54:05.679 align:start position:0%
just wanted to have a comment
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
my only comment is we did send out
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
requests to the agencies today for this
 
01:54:10.709 --> 01:54:10.719 align:start position:0%
and the various other bills that the
 
01:54:13.030 --> 01:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
house amended yesterday so
 
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
again i'm not sure what we'll get back
 
01:54:16.629 --> 01:54:16.639 align:start position:0%
uh by
 
01:54:16.639 --> 01:54:19.430 align:start position:0%
uh by
monday

01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:22.149 --> 01:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
that's all i know so far
 
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
mr ellinghouse is pretty good i've dealt
 
01:54:26.070 --> 01:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
with him too here in finance and i'm
 
01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:31.270 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:54:33.669 --> 01:54:33.679 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um just on that
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
issue uh there may be a unit price or a
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
square footage price
 
01:54:42.550 --> 01:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much all you're going to
 
01:54:48.149 --> 01:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
with respect to the new the two new
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
programs in the fast forward
 
01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:54.070 align:start position:0%
programs in the fast forward
um

01:54:54.070 --> 01:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:57.669 --> 01:54:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
um the the high fidelity wrap around
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
programs um fast forward they're
 
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
they've served so many more kids but
 
01:55:06.070 --> 01:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
there's more demand than we currently
 
01:55:07.669 --> 01:55:07.679 align:start position:0%
have slots for not slots in terms of
 
01:55:09.189 --> 01:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
what's authorized we paid for but slots
 
01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of not having the workforce yet
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
to fill all of that demand particularly
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
a sub component of that that we call
 
01:55:16.149 --> 01:55:16.159 align:start position:0%
trek that's um i'm not remembering what
 
01:55:18.149 --> 01:55:18.159 align:start position:0%
the acronym stands for right now but
 
01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
essentially that's the program that is
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
that goes in when kids are at sysc or in
 
01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
a residential program to help provide
 
01:55:27.030 --> 01:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
that type of
 
01:55:28.709 --> 01:55:28.719 align:start position:0%
support and transition back to the
 
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
community when they leave that program
 
01:55:31.270 --> 01:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
so they don't end up having to come back
 
01:55:33.589 --> 01:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
into this level of care
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
in particular we've not been able to
 
01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
hire enough clinicians to
 
01:55:39.430 --> 01:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
to to bring that out and again it's not
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
a matter of not having the resources
 
01:55:42.950 --> 01:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of the workforce not not
 
01:55:44.709 --> 01:55:44.719 align:start position:0%
being available fast enough to meet the
 
01:55:46.470 --> 01:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
demand that's growing the other two
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
programs being relatively new are still
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
in their ordinary kind of growth as new
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
programs so i don't know that i can say
 
01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:53.109 align:start position:0%
programs so i don't know that i can say
yet

01:55:53.109 --> 01:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
yet
 
01:55:55.510 --> 01:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
that it's um what their workforce issues
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
are but i imagine given that the entire
 
01:56:00.070 --> 01:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
social service and mental health space
 
01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
is being challenged right now in terms
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
of workforce that that that's going to
 
01:56:06.229 --> 01:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
be a challenge for them as well okay uh
 
01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
follow up by me so so if there's a um
 
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
if if
 
01:56:14.390 --> 01:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
do you anticipate with the other two new
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
programs that if
 
01:56:18.629 --> 01:56:18.639 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
the kids needs get larger more kids
 
01:56:24.790 --> 01:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
do you anticipate the same workforce
 
01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:28.310 align:start position:0%
do you anticipate the same workforce
shortage

01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:30.870 --> 01:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
or that's just to wait and see
 
01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't quite follow the the
 
01:56:35.669 --> 01:56:35.679 align:start position:0%
question but so the two new programs are
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
are new so there's probably not a lot of
 
01:56:39.589 --> 01:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
kids in there right now but as they
 
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
build up the the clients do you
 
01:56:45.109 --> 01:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
anticipate workforce shortages there i
 
01:56:47.589 --> 01:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
mean yeah clinicians thank you thank you
 
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
for in thanks for reiterating it for me
 
01:56:51.430 --> 01:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i do anticipate that they will
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
probably experience the same challenges
 
01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
that all of the social service and
 
01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
mental health providers in the state are
 
01:56:59.350 --> 01:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
facing in terms of of workforce
 
01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:00.229 align:start position:0%
facing in terms of of workforce
issues

01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
like i said they're both kind of too new
 
01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
to say that that's a driving driving
 
01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
issue but i wouldn't be at all surprised
 
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
given that we hear that from every
 
01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:08.070 align:start position:0%
given that we hear that from every
provider

01:57:08.070 --> 01:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
provider
 
01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
in this space today okay so so if you if
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
you feel that we should be um
 
01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
so as we move forward and
 
01:57:19.589 --> 01:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
anticipate community services are
 
01:57:19.599 --> 01:57:21.669 align:start position:0%
anticipate community services are
available

01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:21.679 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
in some areas that will may not you know
 
01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
in the manchester nashua larger
 
01:57:30.390 --> 01:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities that may not be the case
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
the capacity will be limited
 
01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i think yeah that's going to
 
01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
be part of the growing pains of building
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
out new systems as as is always the case
 
01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
building out new services i think what i
 
01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
would say and this is um is that my
 
01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
experience building out a very similar
 
01:57:46.709 --> 01:57:46.719 align:start position:0%
system in new jersey was eventually the
 
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
market did correct right we saw schools
 
01:57:50.629 --> 01:57:50.639 align:start position:0%
of social work
 
01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
grow we saw new ones getting developed i
 
01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
heard recently there's another school up
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
here another university here in new
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire that's planning on adding a
 
01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
social work program because of the
 
01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
increased demand so i think you know
 
01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
what and that's the same thing we saw in
 
01:58:03.189 --> 01:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
new jersey we built our system of care
 
01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
there is the demand grew eventually the
 
01:58:07.270 --> 01:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
the market corrected but it it's not
 
01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
instant certainly not quick
 
01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
and uh one more if i may with respect to
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
the uh with respect to privatized
 
01:58:18.149 --> 01:58:18.159 align:start position:0%
uh by understanding was utah
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
um did that and now they're going back
 
01:58:20.639 --> 01:58:21.350 align:start position:0%
um did that and now they're going back
to

01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
state operated
 
01:58:24.790 --> 01:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
yeah part of
 
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
part of the um part of the work that we
 
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
did looking at
 
01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:29.350 align:start position:0%
did looking at
um

01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
how to replace sysc was visiting other
 
01:58:33.669 --> 01:58:33.679 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions and seeing some of their
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
some of their programs to see if there's
 
01:58:36.790 --> 01:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
anything we wanted to emulate frankly we
 
01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
didn't see anything that we wanted to
 
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
emulate we wanted to do something that
 
01:58:42.149 --> 01:58:42.159 align:start position:0%
was that was new and and i think better
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
than what what we saw in other places
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
but yes we did one of the facilities we
 
01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
visited in utah
 
01:58:50.470 --> 01:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
was a privately run facility um through
 
01:58:52.070 --> 01:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
two different companies that ultimately
 
01:58:54.709 --> 01:58:54.719 align:start position:0%
the state of utah decided to take over
 
01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
because they because it was because they
 
01:58:58.870 --> 01:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
weren't pleased with the results they
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
were getting there
 
01:59:06.070 --> 01:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:09.189 --> 01:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
all right i i had informally told myself
 
01:59:12.070 --> 01:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
that we'd try to wrap up by five it's uh
 
01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
4 58. uh i don't want to cut you off if
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
you've got anything else you want to say
 
01:59:18.070 --> 01:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
or for any other representatives like
 
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren have a question
 
01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'm
 
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
short in my chair here so we are the
 
01:59:25.990 --> 01:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
finance committee so i just don't want
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
us to lose
 
01:59:31.109 --> 01:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
lose um sight of the fact that on
 
01:59:34.629 --> 01:59:34.639 align:start position:0%
that the bill we got from hhs
 
01:59:36.629 --> 01:59:36.639 align:start position:0%
has six beds in it
 
01:59:36.639 --> 01:59:38.070 align:start position:0%
has six beds in it
the

01:59:38.070 --> 01:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:43.189 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:59:43.189 --> 01:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
um and then on page seven if there were
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
a page number
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
um on the fiscal note it's for 18 beds
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
and then i would also call attention to
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
01:59:58.629 --> 01:59:58.639 align:start position:0%
on the second page of the fiscal note it
 
02:00:01.109 --> 02:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
says that the money would be
 
02:00:03.510 --> 02:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
appropriated from the american rescue
 
02:00:05.669 --> 02:00:05.679 align:start position:0%
plan act arpa
 
02:00:08.470 --> 02:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
and other discretionary funds federal
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
funds made available just so we
 
02:00:14.629 --> 02:00:14.639 align:start position:0%
keep in our mind that we've got
 
02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:17.679 align:start position:0%
sort of different balls in the air about
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
the size and where the money would come
 
02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:21.030 align:start position:0%
the size and where the money would come
from

02:00:21.030 --> 02:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
that we need to resolve
 
02:00:26.709 --> 02:00:26.719 align:start position:0%
before we pass it to the full committee
 
02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:27.170 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:27.170 --> 02:00:28.550 align:start position:0%
thank you
[Music]

02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
mr are there any other questions
 
02:00:35.109 --> 02:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh okay so mr ribson is last call is
 
02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
there anything that uh you wanted to say
 
02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
that you've not yet had a chance to say
 
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
no thank you okay and then so we have
 
02:00:44.149 --> 02:00:44.159 align:start position:0%
distinguished guests in the audience is
 
02:00:46.390 --> 02:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
there anyone in the audience or the
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:53.830 --> 02:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
i assume you're still honorable
 
02:00:55.589 --> 02:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
for you to decide sir
 
02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the record i'm neil
 
02:00:58.870 --> 02:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
kirk i live in the town of where and i'm
 
02:01:00.790 --> 02:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
here representing myself as many of you
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
know i was a state representative for
 
02:01:06.149 --> 02:01:06.159 align:start position:0%
over 30 years
 
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
on house bill 458 this uh sorry senate
 
02:01:11.589 --> 02:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
bill 458 and this being the finance
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
committee um i think there are two kinds
 
02:01:15.270 --> 02:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
of costs that the committee needs to
 
02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:16.229 align:start position:0%
of costs that the committee needs to
consider

02:01:16.229 --> 02:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
consider
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
before reaching a decision one is the
 
02:01:19.350 --> 02:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
operating cost and one is the
 
02:01:21.189 --> 02:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
construction costs
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
you basically have three things you're
 
02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
considering keeping children in the
 
02:01:27.669 --> 02:01:27.679 align:start position:0%
sununu center
 
02:01:29.589 --> 02:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
building a new facility or rehabbing
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
some sort of a facility
 
02:01:33.589 --> 02:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
or placing the children in a private
 
02:01:33.599 --> 02:01:34.709 align:start position:0%
or placing the children in a private
facility

02:01:34.709 --> 02:01:34.719 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
for each of those
 
02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
where i on the committee i would want to
 
02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:39.350 align:start position:0%
where i on the committee i would want to
know

02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:01:40.870 --> 02:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
what's the cost of construction the
 
02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
capital costs and for each of them what
 
02:01:44.950 --> 02:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
are the operating costs
 
02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh one of the advantages of going to a
 
02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
private facility that we have not had
 
02:01:51.430 --> 02:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
with the sununu center is that the
 
02:01:54.390 --> 02:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
provided the private facility charges a
 
02:01:57.030 --> 02:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
per child per day fee
 
02:01:59.189 --> 02:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
whereas the sununu center or a state
 
02:02:03.030 --> 02:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
operated 12 6 18 bed facility is going
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
to have only fixed costs
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
the private facility has variable costs
 
02:02:07.679 --> 02:02:08.709 align:start position:0%
the private facility has variable costs
so

02:02:08.709 --> 02:02:08.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
should we for the first couple of years
 
02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
have 12 or 15 children in a private
 
02:02:14.709 --> 02:02:14.719 align:start position:0%
facility we'd be paying
 
02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
per child per day roughly 2 thousand
 
02:02:21.189 --> 02:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
dollars um and if we were to uh
 
02:02:23.350 --> 02:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
drop down to twelve or six children
 
02:02:25.270 --> 02:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
obviously for that period of time it
 
02:02:27.030 --> 02:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
would be a smaller number times two
 
02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
thousand per day
 
02:02:32.070 --> 02:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
in order to justify the committee's
 
02:02:33.589 --> 02:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
decisions i think that kind of
 
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
secondly there's a timing issue here
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
as i read the current bill
 
02:02:45.470 --> 02:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
it allows up to
 
02:02:48.709 --> 02:02:48.719 align:start position:0%
2026 to construct the new facility it's
 
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to be done by 2024 but some
 
02:02:53.189 --> 02:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
committee has the right to extend that
 
02:02:55.270 --> 02:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
date for another two years
 
02:02:56.870 --> 02:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
so the real question is what's going to
 
02:02:59.430 --> 02:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
happen to the children between now now
 
02:03:01.189 --> 02:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
and the time the new facility assuming
 
02:03:03.510 --> 02:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a private facility which could
 
02:03:05.669 --> 02:03:05.679 align:start position:0%
meet the statutory deadline
 
02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.639 align:start position:0%
of march 1st 2023 but assuming you
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
decide to go with a a
 
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
state-operated facility
 
02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
new facility
 
02:03:18.149 --> 02:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
is not going to be open until 2024 at
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
the earliest and most likely 2026. we
 
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
know it takes three or four years for us
 
02:03:26.070 --> 02:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
to design and construct uh new
 
02:03:27.990 --> 02:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
facilities such as the new parking
 
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
garage that's being proposed i wouldn't
 
02:03:31.830 --> 02:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
count on any of you
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
operating that during your next
 
02:03:37.589 --> 02:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:37.599 --> 02:03:38.629 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:40.870 --> 02:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is set up the children
 
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
are going to be at the sununu center our
 
02:03:45.270 --> 02:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
existing sununu center between now and
 
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
the time the new facility
 
02:03:50.310 --> 02:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
is operated is opened that's costing you
 
02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
roughly 13 million dollars a year or
 
02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
approximately 1 million dollars a year
 
02:03:58.069 --> 02:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
oh by the way you might want to check
 
02:04:01.350 --> 02:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
with mr ribson how much are we charging
 
02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
vermont for their children here when it
 
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
costs us roughly a million a year per
 
02:04:07.750 --> 02:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
child are we charging them a million a
 
02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:08.629 align:start position:0%
child are we charging them a million a
year

02:04:08.629 --> 02:04:08.639 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
i'd be surprised but it's possible
 
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
so here's a suggestion for you to
 
02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:17.189 align:start position:0%
so here's a suggestion for you to
consider

02:04:17.189 --> 02:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
if you decide to go with a state-run
 
02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
facility a new facility whether it's
 
02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
rehabbing or a separate new facility
 
02:04:25.350 --> 02:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a long period of
 
02:04:27.189 --> 02:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
time before those children are in that
 
02:04:27.199 --> 02:04:28.229 align:start position:0%
time before those children are in that
facility

02:04:28.229 --> 02:04:28.239 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:04:31.109 --> 02:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
why not during that period of time
 
02:04:33.750 --> 02:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
close the sununu center by the statutory
 
02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
date which is 3123
 
02:04:37.990 --> 02:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
and put the children between now and
 
02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:38.870 align:start position:0%
and put the children between now and
then

02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
in a private facility
 
02:04:43.109 --> 02:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
two advantages for those who doubt
 
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
whether a private private facility works
 
02:04:46.950 --> 02:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
you'll have an opportunity to determine
 
02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:47.750 align:start position:0%
you'll have an opportunity to determine
that

02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:04:49.030 --> 02:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
and you'll be saving money in the
 
02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:50.709 align:start position:0%
and you'll be saving money in the
meantime

02:04:50.709 --> 02:04:50.719 align:start position:0%
meantime
 
02:04:50.719 --> 02:04:52.550 align:start position:0%
meantime
so

02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:54.709 --> 02:04:54.719 align:start position:0%
i hope that the committee will get the
 
02:04:56.950 --> 02:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
financial inter information it needs to
 
02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:57.750 align:start position:0%
financial inter information it needs to
make

02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
the kind of quality decisions that this
 
02:05:01.990 --> 02:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
committee is known for
 
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
and that
 
02:05:04.870 --> 02:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
you might consider the timing
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
alternative or option that i proposed
 
02:05:09.510 --> 02:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:05:12.470 --> 02:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
will you take questions but of course
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
um okay so
 
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
this this is not a service that i
 
02:05:19.510 --> 02:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
have ever gone out and looked for you
 
02:05:21.669 --> 02:05:21.679 align:start position:0%
know some place for my kids to be put
 
02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
for a few weeks maybe maybe i needed to
 
02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
and i just didn't but
 
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
are you aware of there being vendors in
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
this space in new hampshire that we
 
02:05:34.069 --> 02:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
could actually contract with to take
 
02:05:36.310 --> 02:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
kids that
 
02:05:39.109 --> 02:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
basically demand
 
02:05:42.149 --> 02:05:42.159 align:start position:0%
a relatively tight security environment
 
02:05:43.830 --> 02:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
and therapy
 
02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:53.589 align:start position:0%
 
nfi

02:05:53.589 --> 02:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
nfi
 
02:05:53.599 --> 02:05:54.870 align:start position:0%
nfi
nfi

02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
nfi
 
02:05:56.550 --> 02:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh both of those would likely bid on
 
02:05:57.990 --> 02:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
this facility
 
02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:05.830 align:start position:0%
this facility
um

02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
okay just so so just to make sure i i'm
 
02:06:10.550 --> 02:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
understanding because i'm learning new
 
02:06:11.669 --> 02:06:11.679 align:start position:0%
things here
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
you're you're saying come on up mr joy
 
02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh you're saying that today
 
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
we have at least two vendors
 
02:06:25.270 --> 02:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
that could receive an rfi or an rfp
 
02:06:29.030 --> 02:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
and respond who are in the state
 
02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
able to provide therapy
 
02:06:34.950 --> 02:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
and also able to assure appropriate
 
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
security and
 
02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
all the prevention of sexual assault
 
02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
that we would have to worry about as
 
02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
well thank you mr chair and just just to
 
02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:46.470 align:start position:0%
well thank you mr chair and just just to
clarify

02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
02:06:49.189 --> 02:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
no one has spoken with any of any vendor
 
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
then i've reached out to vendors vendors
 
02:06:53.189 --> 02:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
aren't comfortable talking about this
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
type of an issue when it's in process so
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
no one's talked to a vendor
 
02:06:59.589 --> 02:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
what representative kirk
 
02:07:00.790 --> 02:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
mr kirk
 
02:07:03.669 --> 02:07:03.679 align:start position:0%
was referring to was that both beckett
 
02:07:06.790 --> 02:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
and nfi have run similar type programs
 
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
in other states
 
02:07:10.310 --> 02:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's the reference
 
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
would they bid
 
02:07:13.589 --> 02:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
i'd like to think so but no one's talked
 
02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
to them
 
02:07:16.870 --> 02:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
and in fact we procure services
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
of this sort through contracts that's
 
02:07:21.669 --> 02:07:21.679 align:start position:0%
what our group homes are our group homes
 
02:07:23.589 --> 02:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
are at a variety of levels of intensity
 
02:07:25.910 --> 02:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
and in fact back in 2017 we last changed
 
02:07:27.510 --> 02:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
this law
 
02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:28.550 align:start position:0%
this law
we

02:07:28.550 --> 02:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:07:30.149 --> 02:07:30.159 align:start position:0%
representative kirk at the time the
 
02:07:31.750 --> 02:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
chair of finance appropriated nine
 
02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:07:36.149 --> 02:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
to make sure because we heard many of
 
02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
the same arguments you're hearing today
 
02:07:38.159 --> 02:07:39.030 align:start position:0%
the same arguments you're hearing today
that

02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:40.629 --> 02:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
effectively the world was going to fall
 
02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
apart he appropriated nine million
 
02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:43.830 align:start position:0%
apart he appropriated nine million
dollars

02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:07:45.910 --> 02:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
which initially was split between two
 
02:07:48.069 --> 02:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
providers one being beckett got about
 
02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
5.6 million dollars at the time and
 
02:07:52.390 --> 02:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
nashua children's home
 
02:07:54.550 --> 02:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
received the rest of it nashua
 
02:07:58.069 --> 02:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
children's home did not ever serve kids
 
02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
um and i won't get into the whys they
 
02:08:02.470 --> 02:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately i don't know if their contra
 
02:08:04.390 --> 02:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
if they
 
02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
backed out of the contract or the
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
contract was repealed but they don't
 
02:08:11.589 --> 02:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
have the contract anymore and based on
 
02:08:14.149 --> 02:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
public documents that contract went to
 
02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
beckett so beckett is receiving nearly
 
02:08:18.390 --> 02:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
nine million dollars 8.7 million dollars
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
that was appropriated back in 2017
 
02:08:24.069 --> 02:08:24.079 align:start position:0%
for an intensive residential program
 
02:08:27.189 --> 02:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
i believe referred to as the erp program
 
02:08:29.910 --> 02:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
so this is not a foreign concept
 
02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
there is not an architecturally secure
 
02:08:37.350 --> 02:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
program in this state that i'm aware of
 
02:08:40.229 --> 02:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
primarily i've i've been led to believe
 
02:08:42.229 --> 02:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
that the department hasn't contracted
 
02:08:44.310 --> 02:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
for architecturally secure programs
 
02:08:46.229 --> 02:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
where i come from massachusetts when i
 
02:08:48.790 --> 02:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
worked in adolescent care
 
02:08:51.109 --> 02:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
architecturally secure facilities were
 
02:08:56.950 --> 02:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:58.550 --> 02:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
i i think you can
 
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
understand my reluctance to have us
 
02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
amend this bill
 
02:09:06.350 --> 02:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
and rely too much on the concept of
 
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
privatization when
 
02:09:10.950 --> 02:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
i i don't know nearly enough about
 
02:09:13.189 --> 02:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's a
 
02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
a market capable of responding to one i
 
02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
i have two business days monday and
 
02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:20.229 align:start position:0%
i have two business days monday and
tuesday

02:09:20.229 --> 02:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
tuesday
 
02:09:20.239 --> 02:09:21.510 align:start position:0%
tuesday
um

02:09:21.510 --> 02:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:23.109 --> 02:09:23.119 align:start position:0%
how how
 
02:09:23.119 --> 02:09:23.990 align:start position:0%
how how
uh

02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:27.119 align:start position:0%
mr kirk and mr de joy how how can i
 
02:09:29.589 --> 02:09:29.599 align:start position:0%
close that circle how could i get
 
02:09:31.990 --> 02:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
confident in an amendment relying on
 
02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:33.589 align:start position:0%
confident in an amendment relying on
that

02:09:33.589 --> 02:09:33.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:09:35.589 --> 02:09:35.599 align:start position:0%
in just a couple days
 
02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
that's a great question mr chair and
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
quite candidly
 
02:09:42.870 --> 02:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
i think that's why this body has policy
 
02:09:46.470 --> 02:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
committees to do that work i think
 
02:09:49.270 --> 02:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
the policy committee has vetted the
 
02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:50.709 align:start position:0%
the policy committee has vetted the
policy

02:09:50.709 --> 02:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
policy
 
02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
they have not touched the finance and in
 
02:09:54.149 --> 02:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
fact senate finance didn't touch the
 
02:09:54.159 --> 02:09:58.229 align:start position:0%
fact senate finance didn't touch the
finance

02:09:58.229 --> 02:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:00.229 --> 02:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
you know short of actually querying all
 
02:10:02.069 --> 02:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
the vendors in the state
 
02:10:03.990 --> 02:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
to ask who would provide this which
 
02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
isn't going to happen before monday or
 
02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:06.709 align:start position:0%
isn't going to happen before monday or
tuesday

02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
tuesday
 
02:10:09.430 --> 02:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
um that's the way that that we get these
 
02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:12.550 align:start position:0%
um that's the way that that we get these
answers

02:10:12.550 --> 02:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
let me add something there is another
 
02:10:14.159 --> 02:10:15.830 align:start position:0%
let me add something there is another
alternative

02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
remember the default position now until
 
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
the new facility is built is that these
 
02:10:22.229 --> 02:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
children will stay in the sununu center
 
02:10:22.239 --> 02:10:23.270 align:start position:0%
children will stay in the sununu center
okay

02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
so put a provision in the bill that says
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
the department will go out to bid for
 
02:10:29.189 --> 02:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
the private facility
 
02:10:31.589 --> 02:10:31.599 align:start position:0%
that will operate between the time it
 
02:10:34.709 --> 02:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
can start and the time that the new
 
02:10:34.719 --> 02:10:35.830 align:start position:0%
can start and the time that the new
facility

02:10:35.830 --> 02:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
state facility is built and put that out
 
02:10:39.510 --> 02:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
to bid
 
02:10:41.669 --> 02:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
obviously if there aren't any bids or
 
02:10:43.589 --> 02:10:43.599 align:start position:0%
the bids aren't acceptable then the
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
default position would continue so
 
02:10:49.030 --> 02:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
you've got the best of both worlds there
 
02:10:51.270 --> 02:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
it deals with the concerns mr chairman
 
02:10:55.030 --> 02:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
that you've expressed and i share them
 
02:10:57.189 --> 02:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
but it also allows for that possibility
 
02:10:59.270 --> 02:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
to go forward maybe these folks will bid
 
02:11:01.270 --> 02:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
maybe others will come in to bid maybe
 
02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:03.599 align:start position:0%
nobody will come into bed but bid but in
 
02:11:04.870 --> 02:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
the meantime you still have your
 
02:11:07.109 --> 02:11:07.119 align:start position:0%
fallback position which is the same as
 
02:11:09.270 --> 02:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
the one that's in the bill now so
 
02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
there's no harm no foul
 
02:11:14.149 --> 02:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i'm i'm it's great to have
 
02:11:15.510 --> 02:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
your experience shared with us
 
02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate it um
 
02:11:19.270 --> 02:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
do you have anything else that you'd
 
02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
like to say either
 
02:11:24.550 --> 02:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
mr dejoy mr kirk
 
02:11:27.270 --> 02:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
i i can only emphasize as strongly as
 
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
possible that you need some sort of
 
02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
figures as to the operating costs
 
02:11:33.750 --> 02:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
because one of the problems with the
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
sununu center is that it's a fixed cost
 
02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:37.750 align:start position:0%
sununu center is that it's a fixed cost
operation

02:11:37.750 --> 02:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
operation
 
02:11:39.669 --> 02:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
we're spending the same amount for 14
 
02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
kids as we did for 60 kids
 
02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:46.550 align:start position:0%
kids as we did for 60 kids
and

02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:48.069 --> 02:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
at least if i were on the finance
 
02:11:49.750 --> 02:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
committee i i'd want to look to future
 
02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
budgets the idea is not to lock
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
ourselves into something that's going to
 
02:11:55.669 --> 02:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
be very expensive and fixed cost when in
 
02:11:57.589 --> 02:11:57.599 align:start position:0%
fact there may be another alternative
 
02:11:59.990 --> 02:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
but the data is essential
 
02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
the department can probably come up with
 
02:12:04.629 --> 02:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
some back of the envelope reasonable
 
02:12:06.550 --> 02:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
estimates although they certainly won't
 
02:12:08.629 --> 02:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
be as good as they would be if they had
 
02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
the normal amount of time
 
02:12:13.589 --> 02:12:13.599 align:start position:0%
so the stab that we've taken at the in
 
02:12:16.390 --> 02:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
that general direction is the idea
 
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
that possibly if the facility was
 
02:12:20.629 --> 02:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
co-located next to
 
02:12:22.629 --> 02:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
a facility that they could share
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
maybe the warehousing and logistics
 
02:12:34.069 --> 02:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
could maybe rely on um
 
02:12:36.550 --> 02:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
behavioral health specialists in an
 
02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
emergent situation to come help with a 2
 
02:12:42.310 --> 02:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
a.m admission that the co-location could
 
02:12:45.189 --> 02:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
really cut down on the operating costs
 
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
now we don't have any numbers to back
 
02:12:49.350 --> 02:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
that up that's just theory do you have a
 
02:12:52.870 --> 02:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
comment i agree with you that will
 
02:12:54.709 --> 02:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
reduce the operating costs but they will
 
02:12:56.629 --> 02:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
still be fixed
 
02:12:58.629 --> 02:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
regardless of the number of children the
 
02:13:00.629 --> 02:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
operating cost of that facility will be
 
02:13:04.310 --> 02:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
eight say eight million dollars a year
 
02:13:07.109 --> 02:13:07.119 align:start position:0%
to the extent that it's set up for 18
 
02:13:08.550 --> 02:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
which is what you folks are talking
 
02:13:09.669 --> 02:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
about now
 
02:13:13.270 --> 02:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that mr ribson's uh
 
02:13:15.030 --> 02:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
future projections are correct and it
 
02:13:17.910 --> 02:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
comes down to be six in three four five
 
02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:18.790 align:start position:0%
comes down to be six in three four five
years

02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:13:20.550 --> 02:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
we're still stuck with that eight
 
02:13:22.229 --> 02:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars when in fact it would
 
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
cost us less
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
if these children were in a private
 
02:13:27.510 --> 02:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
facility and we were paying per child
 
02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:28.830 align:start position:0%
facility and we were paying per child
per

02:13:28.830 --> 02:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
per
 
02:13:31.669 --> 02:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
day there are risks going both ways mr
 
02:13:33.830 --> 02:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
chairman and you may be more comfortable
 
02:13:36.069 --> 02:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
than i am with one particular solution
 
02:13:37.750 --> 02:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
but those to me seem to be the
 
02:13:39.750 --> 02:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
parameters all right uh thank you for
 
02:13:41.589 --> 02:13:41.599 align:start position:0%
that i i just would want to point out
 
02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
that mr ribson uh i don't think has ever
 
02:13:46.390 --> 02:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
said that six is even possible even
 
02:13:48.149 --> 02:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
under the best scenario but whatever it
 
02:13:49.669 --> 02:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
is whatever it is and then i wouldn't
 
02:13:52.629 --> 02:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
want to get into a debate on you know uh
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
all costs are fixed in the near term you
 
02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
know it's it's the long term when they
 
02:13:59.669 --> 02:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
become variable and so i would hope that
 
02:14:02.229 --> 02:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
if we went from 18 to six
 
02:14:04.390 --> 02:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
that somebody in the division three
 
02:14:06.470 --> 02:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
would be smart enough to cut the budget
 
02:14:08.709 --> 02:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
but uh you never know
 
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
let me answer that by saying that
 
02:14:13.350 --> 02:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
in the um 10 20 years that we've been
 
02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
doing sununu budgets and the population
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
has been decreasing we've never been
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:23.669 --> 02:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for that do you have
 
02:14:23.679 --> 02:14:24.550 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for that do you have
any

02:14:24.550 --> 02:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
final remarks here mr
 
02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:27.270 align:start position:0%
final remarks here mr
joy

02:14:27.270 --> 02:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
joy
 
02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair if it's uh
 
02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's okay with the chair i like to defer
 
02:14:32.950 --> 02:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
comments until next week given the time
 
02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
there are num there are a number of
 
02:14:36.229 --> 02:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
comments today that were presented as
 
02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
factual which are really opinion there
 
02:14:40.709 --> 02:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
are a number of misstatements today but
 
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
i would i would end
 
02:14:44.069 --> 02:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to be able to speak next
 
02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
week but i would say that mr ripsom
 
02:14:49.270 --> 02:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
explained to you quite succinctly why
 
02:14:50.950 --> 02:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
the policy committee made the decision
 
02:14:53.350 --> 02:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
they made to move forward in the way
 
02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
they did mr ribson talked quite
 
02:14:59.430 --> 02:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
accurately about ramping up programs and
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
how we effectively are going to be
 
02:15:03.270 --> 02:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
losing another generation of kids in
 
02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:05.669 align:start position:0%
losing another generation of kids in
sununu

02:15:42.709 --> 02:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
would like to shed some light on
 
02:15:46.470 --> 02:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
what what happened there and um it
 
02:15:50.950 --> 02:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
both with hb 458 and 254
 
02:15:51.990 --> 02:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
they were
 
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
rushed through
 
02:15:56.069 --> 02:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
committee with
 
02:15:56.079 --> 02:15:57.750 align:start position:0%
committee with
um

02:15:57.750 --> 02:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
very little time to announ um do
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
analysis on the policy
 
02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:05.750 align:start position:0%
analysis on the policy
with

02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:07.189 align:start position:0%
with
458

02:16:07.189 --> 02:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
458
 
02:16:09.270 --> 02:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
the it came to our committee the week
 
02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
before we voted on it and we had the
 
02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:13.109 align:start position:0%
before we voted on it and we had the
amendment

02:16:13.109 --> 02:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
less than an hour before we voted on it
 
02:16:18.310 --> 02:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
and it was a deadline day that we could
 
02:16:21.270 --> 02:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
not not vote on it and so
 
02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:22.069 align:start position:0%
not not vote on it and so
there

02:16:22.069 --> 02:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:16:22.079 --> 02:16:23.350 align:start position:0%
there
um

02:16:23.350 --> 02:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
there was never a discussion in the
 
02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
committee that um six beds was the
 
02:16:29.510 --> 02:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate size
 
02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:30.830 align:start position:0%
appropriate size
and

02:16:30.830 --> 02:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:34.389 --> 02:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
it i believe that um it was
 
02:16:36.549 --> 02:16:36.559 align:start position:0%
the intention of the committee that
 
02:16:36.559 --> 02:16:37.910 align:start position:0%
the intention of the committee that
it

02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:16:42.309 --> 02:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
was not going to be six beds um as as
 
02:16:45.349 --> 02:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh ripson said it's
 
02:16:49.349 --> 02:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:49.359 --> 02:16:50.469 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:16:50.469 --> 02:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
i also
 
02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
expressed concern with the 254 language
 
02:16:58.150 --> 02:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
in the committee and not having time and
 
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
not being criminal justice or judiciary
 
02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
to know which laws
 
02:17:03.359 --> 02:17:05.110 align:start position:0%
to know which laws
um

02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:17:09.270 --> 02:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh what ramifications as far as
 
02:17:12.230 --> 02:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
as charging people as as uh
 
02:17:13.830 --> 02:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
as adults
 
02:17:15.509 --> 02:17:15.519 align:start position:0%
the repeat offender thing that was
 
02:17:17.750 --> 02:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
brought up yesterday as far as you know
 
02:17:19.990 --> 02:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
smashing in cars every day
 
02:17:22.469 --> 02:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
uh you know of high school that would be
 
02:17:25.669 --> 02:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
allowed um or
 
02:17:27.589 --> 02:17:27.599 align:start position:0%
they would never be committed or they
 
02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:33.509 --> 02:17:33.519 align:start position:0%
and if that
 
02:17:35.669 --> 02:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
information was
 
02:17:37.990 --> 02:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
you know kids talk at school they find
 
02:17:41.349 --> 02:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
out that you know that is
 
02:17:44.230 --> 02:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
that property crimes are not
 
02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
taken seriously then you know uh in
 
02:17:49.429 --> 02:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
california if you park your car you just
 
02:17:51.750 --> 02:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
expect it the window to get broken and
 
02:17:53.990 --> 02:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
and your stuff to be stolen in it and
 
02:17:55.830 --> 02:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
that could um be brought to new
 
02:17:58.629 --> 02:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire mr chairman i think this is
 
02:18:00.309 --> 02:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
really verging on inappropriate
 
02:18:02.389 --> 02:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
characterizations i would question the
 
02:18:04.549 --> 02:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
relevance of that right now
 
02:18:08.309 --> 02:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
i i am being deferential to a fellow
 
02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
state representative who is telling us
 
02:18:13.990 --> 02:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
what happened in children and family law
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
and sharing with us
 
02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
what his perspective of
 
02:18:18.319 --> 02:18:19.830 align:start position:0%
what his perspective of
458

02:18:19.830 --> 02:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
458
 
02:18:22.549 --> 02:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
is based on the fact that they heard it
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
in a relatively abbreviated time frame
 
02:18:29.349 --> 02:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
so i i i have found it interesting
 
02:18:32.150 --> 02:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
already to pick up from his comments
 
02:18:36.549 --> 02:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
that uh the implications of 254 on what
 
02:18:39.509 --> 02:18:39.519 align:start position:0%
it might mean to incarceration levels
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
and that the the number six versus 18
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't discussed very completely that
 
02:18:47.750 --> 02:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
though both of those are fairly
 
02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:51.599 align:start position:0%
significant and uh illuminating to me
 
02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
so i i would like to allow him to
 
02:18:56.309 --> 02:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
continue if that's all right
 
02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
i have no problem with his
 
02:18:59.589 --> 02:18:59.599 align:start position:0%
characterization of his view of what
 
02:19:01.429 --> 02:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
went on in child and family that he's
 
02:19:02.709 --> 02:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
free to express his view but when you
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
start talking about people you can't
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
park your car in california without
 
02:19:07.429 --> 02:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
having the windows smashed i think
 
02:19:11.190 --> 02:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
that's over the top i i i think uh we
 
02:19:13.830 --> 02:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
probably all have our own perceptions of
 
02:19:16.230 --> 02:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
what's happening in other states other
 
02:19:19.270 --> 02:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
than new hampshire based on our own
 
02:19:21.429 --> 02:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
narrow view of the news
 
02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
and i would hope that we're all
 
02:19:25.429 --> 02:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
intelligent enough to filter out
 
02:19:27.270 --> 02:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
anything that we think needs to be
 
02:19:28.950 --> 02:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
filtered out from
 
02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
representative yokela's observations of
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
the news and what's going on in other
 
02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
states i i i i think we can handle the
 
02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:38.150 align:start position:0%
states i i i i think we can handle the
discourse

02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
discourse
 
02:19:39.910 --> 02:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
i've had a car parked in california for
 
02:19:41.110 --> 02:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
the last six years and the windows
 
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
haven't been broken once
 
02:19:45.270 --> 02:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
i had a car parked in new york and the
 
02:19:48.070 --> 02:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
windows were broken in so but i never
 
02:19:50.790 --> 02:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
had it broken in in california so
 
02:19:52.950 --> 02:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
but go ahead representative ocala you're
 
02:19:56.389 --> 02:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
doing great thank you uh chairman and um
 
02:19:59.110 --> 02:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
i don't have experience from the news i
 
02:20:01.590 --> 02:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
was born in california and in the bay
 
02:20:01.600 --> 02:20:02.389 align:start position:0%
was born in california and in the bay
area

02:20:02.389 --> 02:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
and i lived there for many years and i
 
02:20:07.510 --> 02:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
didn't say that at parking in california
 
02:20:09.510 --> 02:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
you would get your window broken i said
 
02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
san francisco
 
02:20:14.550 --> 02:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
and that's much more specific and i
 
02:20:16.150 --> 02:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
would never make the statement that you
 
02:20:17.349 --> 02:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
can't park your car in california
 
02:20:17.359 --> 02:20:19.510 align:start position:0%
can't park your car in california
because

02:20:19.510 --> 02:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:20:21.510 --> 02:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
i parked in other parts of california
 
02:20:22.630 --> 02:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
and didn't get
 
02:20:22.640 --> 02:20:23.349 align:start position:0%
and didn't get
like

02:20:23.349 --> 02:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:20:25.429 --> 02:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
the windows broken so i
 
02:20:27.750 --> 02:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
i uh that was
 
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit taken
 
02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so my
 
02:20:34.469 --> 02:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
in general my my uh
 
02:20:36.790 --> 02:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
there was comments made earlier in this
 
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
hearing that that you guys should be
 
02:20:42.550 --> 02:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
stuck to the policy positions and um
 
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
that this was fully vetted by a policy
 
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm saying that um i would
 
02:20:51.429 --> 02:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
i believe that is then that uh
 
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:20:55.190 --> 02:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
knew that we only had a limited amount
 
02:20:57.030 --> 02:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
of time and we knew that this was an
 
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:03.190 align:start position:0%
 
to

02:21:03.190 --> 02:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
do the best that we could with the time
 
02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
that we had but we did not have time to
 
02:21:08.950 --> 02:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
fully vetted and so
 
02:21:10.389 --> 02:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
that i don't think that you should be
 
02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
wedded to the six six uh
 
02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:14.870 align:start position:0%
wedded to the six six uh
um

02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
six bed thing and there was a discussion
 
02:21:19.750 --> 02:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
in our committee about um maybe not
 
02:21:22.469 --> 02:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
having 12 18 beds because
 
02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:30.389 --> 02:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
have be able to have people moved around
 
02:21:32.230 --> 02:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
there was there was discussion about
 
02:21:33.670 --> 02:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
having um
 
02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
movable walls or or movable beds and so
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
that you could separate people and
 
02:21:41.830 --> 02:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
maybe make this room bigger if if
 
02:21:43.670 --> 02:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
everyone would be able to fit or if you
 
02:21:45.910 --> 02:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
had a wall that needed to be put up to
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
separate people that that might be a
 
02:21:49.830 --> 02:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
solution instead of having
 
02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
the beds be the deciding factor and
 
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
maybe it would be more mobile
 
02:21:56.469 --> 02:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
the bed capacity
 
02:21:57.910 --> 02:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
and so there was
 
02:22:01.349 --> 02:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
some fluidity as far as that um
 
02:22:03.030 --> 02:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
the re one of the reasons why we thought
 
02:22:05.830 --> 02:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
we could come down from the the 12
 
02:22:09.349 --> 02:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
or the the 18 was that maybe if you had
 
02:22:12.309 --> 02:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
12 12 beds with movable walls depending
 
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
on how it was situated maybe you would
 
02:22:17.349 --> 02:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
still be able to um service the people
 
02:22:19.750 --> 02:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
that that would be placed there
 
02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so thank you
 
02:22:26.790 --> 02:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
did the committee uh discuss the
 
02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
implications of sending this to interim
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
study to buy more time to get try to get
 
02:22:33.110 --> 02:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
it right
 
02:22:34.150 --> 02:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
for the question um no because in hb2
 
02:22:40.790 --> 02:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
there's already a commitment that we're
 
02:22:43.910 --> 02:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
closing sununu on
 
02:22:46.150 --> 02:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
the first of march
 
02:22:47.910 --> 02:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:22:50.469 --> 02:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
it was believed
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
that this
 
02:22:54.309 --> 02:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
that closing it without a plan was
 
02:22:57.510 --> 02:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and so we needed a plan
 
02:22:59.349 --> 02:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:23:00.710 --> 02:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
that this
 
02:23:03.349 --> 02:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
plan was the best plan plan that we were
 
02:23:04.790 --> 02:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
offered in committee and so that's the
 
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
one that we chose
 
02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
and that that i think that's uh
 
02:23:12.309 --> 02:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
my perspective on that whether or not um
 
02:23:13.830 --> 02:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
the other people in the committee feel
 
02:23:15.510 --> 02:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
that this maybe this was the perfect
 
02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
plan i don't but um
 
02:23:20.150 --> 02:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
i did not get that sense from the
 
02:23:22.309 --> 02:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
committee and it definitely was not my
 
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
my opinion in the committee thank you
 
02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative long
 
02:23:28.710 --> 02:23:28.720 align:start position:0%

different this term i've had a lot of
 
02:23:34.309 --> 02:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
rapid fire
 
02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of rapid fire amendments
 
02:23:36.720 --> 02:23:39.670 align:start position:0%
a lot of rapid fire amendments
um

02:23:39.670 --> 02:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:40.870 --> 02:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
this was
 
02:23:43.110 --> 02:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
this was discussed may not have been
 
02:23:45.110 --> 02:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
discussed as much when this amendment
 
02:23:48.550 --> 02:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
came but 254 was discussed
 
02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
the bad situation could you remind us
 
02:23:52.630 --> 02:23:52.640 align:start position:0%

uh
 
02:24:09.190 --> 02:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
is this the best i mean
 
02:24:11.349 --> 02:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
every time i vote yes on a on a bill and
 
02:24:13.110 --> 02:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
go to the floor
 
02:24:15.510 --> 02:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
i never know i i can never say in my
 
02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
head this is the best uh because i'm
 
02:24:19.030 --> 02:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
gonna get to the floor somebody's gonna
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
say something and i'm gonna say you know
 
02:24:23.110 --> 02:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
what that's not a bad idea so
 
02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:24.550 align:start position:0%
what that's not a bad idea so
um

02:24:24.550 --> 02:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:26.950 --> 02:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
you know as long as producing the best
 
02:24:29.990 --> 02:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
now that however this amendment did pass
 
02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:31.990 align:start position:0%
now that however this amendment did pass
13-1

02:24:31.990 --> 02:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
13-1
 
02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:33.910 align:start position:0%
13-1
so

02:24:33.910 --> 02:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
you know i'd like to think we're all
 
02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
dedicated as equals
 
02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:39.910 align:start position:0%
dedicated as equals
um

02:24:39.910 --> 02:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:43.270 --> 02:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
and uh you know i i think i think this
 
02:24:45.030 --> 02:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
was a good bill now if there's are there
 
02:24:46.710 --> 02:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
some problems that i'm reconsidering
 
02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely more to talk about this i'm
 
02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:49.990 align:start position:0%
absolutely more to talk about this i'm
reconsidering

02:24:49.990 --> 02:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
reconsidering
 
02:24:51.750 --> 02:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
may i ask you a question sure you're
 
02:24:54.790 --> 02:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
comfortable with six instead of 12 or 18
 
02:24:56.710 --> 02:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
or some other number do you think six is
 
02:24:58.550 --> 02:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
the right number yeah well i i mean if
 
02:25:00.950 --> 02:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
we look at the house bill 254
 
02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
and uh after listening to mr ripson
 
02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:04.950 align:start position:0%
and uh after listening to mr ripson
saying

02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
saying
 
02:25:08.389 --> 02:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
that 254 may not
 
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
be the result we're looking for and i
 
02:25:11.670 --> 02:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
could agree with that he's not committed
 
02:25:14.230 --> 02:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
to that but i i could see that
 
02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:15.590 align:start position:0%
to that but i i could see that
possibility

02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
02:25:18.309 --> 02:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
then um
 
02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
yep i
 
02:25:20.950 --> 02:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't
 
02:25:23.429 --> 02:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
i'm open to six bets
 
02:25:25.590 --> 02:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm open to
 
02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:26.790 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm open to
what

02:25:26.790 --> 02:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:25:29.270 --> 02:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
the final census after hearing all this
 
02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
information will bring me to what
 
02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:33.429 align:start position:0%
information will bring me to what
conclusion

02:25:33.429 --> 02:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
conclusion
 
02:25:37.110 --> 02:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm open so so you're open so if
 
02:25:39.750 --> 02:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
if if more analysis was provided to you
 
02:25:41.670 --> 02:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
and it indicated that the number should
 
02:25:43.590 --> 02:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
be 14
 
02:25:46.070 --> 02:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
18 you're open to looking at that
 
02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:47.510 align:start position:0%
18 you're open to looking at that
analysis

02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
02:25:49.990 --> 02:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
i'm also look open to looking at what
 
02:25:53.429 --> 02:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
representative uh lost uh mentioned with
 
02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
a building that we currently have sure i
 
02:25:59.429 --> 02:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
you know talk about savings all right i
 
02:26:02.550 --> 02:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
so so mr ribson if i could if i could if
 
02:26:05.830 --> 02:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
i could just reach over and ask you
 
02:26:07.510 --> 02:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
i think you've already prepared it
 
02:26:10.070 --> 02:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
because it was in the a m report could
 
02:26:12.950 --> 02:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
you get an abstract together for us uh
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
for specifically for representative long
 
02:26:17.270 --> 02:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
to show
 
02:26:22.070 --> 02:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
what kind of analysis uh dcyf has had on
 
02:26:25.030 --> 02:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
on what the forecasted bed count ought
 
02:26:26.230 --> 02:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:26:30.070 --> 02:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:32.389 --> 02:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
within the a m report and we run data
 
02:26:34.950 --> 02:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
every month that i i can give you data
 
02:26:36.950 --> 02:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
every single day for the past
 
02:26:39.030 --> 02:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
three years exactly how many male female
 
02:26:41.030 --> 02:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
detained committed i have that chart for
 
02:26:47.190 --> 02:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:48.950 --> 02:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay so if you wouldn't mind it uh if
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
you could send that to mr ripple and mr
 
02:26:53.429 --> 02:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
ripple if you could distribute that to
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
the members here are are you gonna be
 
02:26:57.990 --> 02:26:58.000 align:start position:0%

all right i want to inform you because i
 
02:27:14.469 --> 02:27:14.479 align:start position:0%
think it's a good and valid question but
 
02:27:15.429 --> 02:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
i just
 
02:27:16.469 --> 02:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
if we don't
 
02:27:18.790 --> 02:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
really vote this out until tuesday of
 
02:27:20.469 --> 02:27:20.479 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee i just don't know if
 
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
the next person's going to have
 
02:27:24.070 --> 02:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
continuity but but we'll worry about
 
02:27:26.309 --> 02:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
that later i'm thinking i'm going to be
 
02:27:26.319 --> 02:27:27.349 align:start position:0%
that later i'm thinking i'm going to be
subbing

02:27:27.349 --> 02:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
subbing
 
02:27:29.510 --> 02:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
till tuesday so all right
 
02:27:31.190 --> 02:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
well maybe you could ask for continuity
 
02:27:35.670 --> 02:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:38.469 --> 02:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
uh so representative ukela did we hit
 
02:27:41.510 --> 02:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
everything you wanted to talk about
 
02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:44.630 align:start position:0%
everything you wanted to talk about
um

02:27:44.630 --> 02:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:48.309 --> 02:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
yeah so um as far as 254 in committee we
 
02:27:51.510 --> 02:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
did we did talk about it we just um did
 
02:27:54.070 --> 02:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
not discuss each
 
02:27:57.270 --> 02:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
each crime and whether or not we thought
 
02:27:59.349 --> 02:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
it would it should go to
 
02:28:01.270 --> 02:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
the person should be committed or not
 
02:28:03.270 --> 02:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
you know if they get texting while
 
02:28:05.110 --> 02:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
driving should they get 15 years like we
 
02:28:07.110 --> 02:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
voted yesterday or should they not go to
 
02:28:09.910 --> 02:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
jail at all just we did not touch on any
 
02:28:12.150 --> 02:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
of that and so
 
02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:13.429 align:start position:0%
of that and so
that

02:28:13.429 --> 02:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:28:14.950 --> 02:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
so what i think i heard you just say is
 
02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
you looked at the totality of 254 as in
 
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
sort of an aggregate but you didn't
 
02:28:24.550 --> 02:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
de-aggre aggregate it so that you could
 
02:28:27.349 --> 02:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
assess an individual impact per
 
02:28:29.270 --> 02:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh section of the law
 
02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
right we we had the um
 
02:28:33.190 --> 02:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
the goal of
 
02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:34.389 align:start position:0%
the goal of
not

02:28:34.389 --> 02:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
putting in people that in into jail that
 
02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:39.110 align:start position:0%
putting in people that in into jail that
were

02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:28:41.429 --> 02:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
not violent
 
02:28:44.950 --> 02:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
that was the kind of overarching
 
02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:46.389 align:start position:0%
that was the kind of overarching
um

02:28:46.389 --> 02:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:46.399 --> 02:28:47.510 align:start position:0%
um
sentiment

02:28:47.510 --> 02:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
sentiment
 
02:28:49.349 --> 02:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
that i that i got from the committee
 
02:28:52.389 --> 02:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you very much uh
 
02:28:57.910 --> 02:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:01.990 --> 02:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
of the drc mr chairman yes
 
02:29:04.630 --> 02:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
can i just expand on the request to mr
 
02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:05.750 align:start position:0%
can i just expand on the request to mr
ribson

02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
ribson
 
02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:06.550 align:start position:0%
ribson
sure

02:29:06.550 --> 02:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:29:08.469 --> 02:29:08.479 align:start position:0%
mr ribson we have uh
 
02:29:10.070 --> 02:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
okay he doesn't have to come up no no i
 
02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
just want him to pay attention he was
 
02:29:14.950 --> 02:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
um so in addition to
 
02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
how many males and females are there can
 
02:29:19.670 --> 02:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
we know what they're in for because as
 
02:29:21.429 --> 02:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
the law has changed some of the things
 
02:29:22.790 --> 02:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
that they may have been incarcerated for
 
02:29:24.389 --> 02:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
in the last three years they may not be
 
02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
permitted to be incarcerated for today
 
02:29:28.950 --> 02:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
so if in the data we know why they're
 
02:29:30.710 --> 02:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
incarcerated that might give us better
 
02:29:33.670 --> 02:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
data in terms of trying to figure out
 
02:29:35.830 --> 02:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
whether those population numbers are
 
02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
relevant to the population that's going
 
02:29:41.590 --> 02:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:43.590 --> 02:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that there is nobody
 
02:29:44.870 --> 02:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
there today who was there three years
 
02:29:46.630 --> 02:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
ago right everybody that's there today
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
is there under current law
 
02:29:49.510 --> 02:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
there are no kids there that have been
 
02:29:51.110 --> 02:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
there for more than
 
02:29:52.630 --> 02:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
a year sure but but you were going to
 
02:29:54.150 --> 02:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
give us three years worth of data and
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
the law three years ago represent was
 
02:29:57.590 --> 02:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
different than the law today haven't we
 
02:29:59.190 --> 02:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
narrowed what crimes they can be
 
02:30:00.550 --> 02:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
committed for i think it was four or
 
02:30:02.150 --> 02:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
five four or so years ago that law
 
02:30:04.389 --> 02:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
changed okay but can we still get an
 
02:30:06.469 --> 02:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
idea of how many of them are there on
 
02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
basically pre-child dependent and how
 
02:30:09.670 --> 02:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
many are sentenced so we have some idea
 
02:30:10.950 --> 02:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
why they're there
 
02:30:12.950 --> 02:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
yeah the data that i have has committed
 
02:30:15.270 --> 02:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
verse detained so you have that what
 
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
that data does not have is what the
 
02:30:18.309 --> 02:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
individual charges are at one point
 
02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
about a year ago as i had somebody do a
 
02:30:22.309 --> 02:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
huge project of a hand count to figure
 
02:30:25.030 --> 02:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
that out i don't have a person to do
 
02:30:26.230 --> 02:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
that right now
 
02:30:26.240 --> 02:30:27.190 align:start position:0%
that right now
but

02:30:27.190 --> 02:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:30:28.710 --> 02:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
i can share the data that that person
 
02:30:30.790 --> 02:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
gathered a year or so ago what i would
 
02:30:32.710 --> 02:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
say what's misleading about that type of
 
02:30:32.720 --> 02:30:33.590 align:start position:0%
say what's misleading about that type of
data

02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:30:35.190 --> 02:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
is that it looks at what the charge was
 
02:30:36.469 --> 02:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
that they were brought in on and
 
02:30:39.349 --> 02:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
oftentimes common practice is to plea
 
02:30:41.750 --> 02:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
down to a lesser charge and if you took
 
02:30:43.270 --> 02:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
away the ability to plead to a lesser
 
02:30:45.270 --> 02:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
charge you would change the actions
 
02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
potentially of prosecutors and judges no
 
02:30:49.110 --> 02:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
i understand that and you would also
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
skew the data as to why they're really
 
02:30:52.870 --> 02:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
there if they're sentenced right no i
 
02:30:54.790 --> 02:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate that well however much you
 
02:30:56.309 --> 02:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
can give this committee i'm sure it
 
02:30:58.469 --> 02:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
would be helpful in for us trying to to
 
02:30:59.910 --> 02:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
look at these kinds of numbers so i
 
02:31:01.510 --> 02:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that i can definitely share
 
02:31:03.270 --> 02:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
the data that was pulled a year ago on
 
02:31:05.670 --> 02:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
the charges um which will obviously not
 
02:31:08.550 --> 02:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
be as as current um i just can't get new
 
02:31:10.389 --> 02:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
data on that because it was a huge hand
 
02:31:11.990 --> 02:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
count project and i don't have a person
 
02:31:13.510 --> 02:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
the person who used to do it left the
 
02:31:15.910 --> 02:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
agency and i it's going to be hard to
 
02:31:17.349 --> 02:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
pull that off you sound like every
 
02:31:18.950 --> 02:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
businessman in the state i don't have
 
02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
enough employees i don't have a data
 
02:31:23.429 --> 02:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
team our whole data team left for much
 
02:31:26.389 --> 02:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
better paying jobs so it's really hard
 
02:31:27.830 --> 02:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
to pull some of these things together
 
02:31:30.309 --> 02:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it is and you have my sympathy
 
02:31:32.790 --> 02:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
so so mr ribson i i think i saw that
 
02:31:34.950 --> 02:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
data and and i think i remember a
 
02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
disclaimer but i'm going to ask you to
 
02:31:39.270 --> 02:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
verify this that one of the disclaimers
 
02:31:42.550 --> 02:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
on the charge that was listed was that
 
02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
had they ha
 
02:31:44.399 --> 02:31:45.510 align:start position:0%
had they ha
initially

02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
initially
 
02:31:47.429 --> 02:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
in their initial contact if they had
 
02:31:49.510 --> 02:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
multiple charges
 
02:31:51.910 --> 02:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
the multiple charges may not
 
02:31:54.469 --> 02:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
show up and that it gets
 
02:31:56.550 --> 02:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
down to just one charge
 
02:31:59.349 --> 02:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
when actually much more is going on is
 
02:32:01.030 --> 02:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
that is that right that's right there
 
02:32:02.469 --> 02:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
are a lot of there are a lot of
 
02:32:04.790 --> 02:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
limitations in that data because dcyf
 
02:32:06.630 --> 02:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
isn't the charging entity and we don't
 
02:32:08.389 --> 02:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
really maintain that so we're pulling we
 
02:32:11.110 --> 02:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
were pulling that data from notes
 
02:32:13.510 --> 02:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
in in our cases right which is not you
 
02:32:14.630 --> 02:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
know i don't know if the court to
 
02:32:16.389 --> 02:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
maintain a database that has that more
 
02:32:19.429 --> 02:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
precisely i don't believe they do but
 
02:32:21.510 --> 02:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
our our ability to get that information
 
02:32:26.710 --> 02:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:29.190 --> 02:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:31.429 --> 02:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
is there anyone in the audience that has
 
02:32:33.990 --> 02:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
margaritas for us it's well past five
 
02:32:37.110 --> 02:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
o'clock at this point
 
02:32:39.030 --> 02:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
we thought you were providing them yeah
 
02:32:40.630 --> 02:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
i'm so sorry
 
02:32:44.150 --> 02:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
so i i is this a is this uh handout
 
02:32:45.750 --> 02:32:45.760 align:start position:0%

02:32:54.550 --> 02:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
if that's okay plenty of indulgence i'm
 
02:32:57.590 --> 02:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
just asking is this is this your form
 
02:33:00.469 --> 02:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
and and if it is the answer is yes then
 
02:33:02.630 --> 02:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
i i would ask you to please
 
02:33:06.469 --> 02:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
email a pdf to uh mr ripple so that we
 
02:33:08.630 --> 02:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
can have a digital part of our record
 
02:33:10.469 --> 02:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
because this is such a great document we
 
02:33:13.270 --> 02:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
want to keep it forever i'd be happy to
 
02:33:15.030 --> 02:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
for the record i'm karen rosenberg i'm
 
02:33:16.630 --> 02:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
the policy director at the disability
 
02:33:18.870 --> 02:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
rights center and i'm here with
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
i'm michelle wonga and i'm the youth law
 
02:33:21.750 --> 02:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
project director at new hampshire legal
 
02:33:23.910 --> 02:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
assistance and our organizations
 
02:33:25.510 --> 02:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
together with the
 
02:33:27.030 --> 02:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
american civil liberties union of new
 
02:33:30.150 --> 02:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire new futures and waypoint are
 
02:33:31.750 --> 02:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
in a collaboration which we refer to as
 
02:33:33.429 --> 02:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
the juvenile rights
 
02:33:35.270 --> 02:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
policy group
 
02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:36.150 align:start position:0%
policy group
and

02:33:36.150 --> 02:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:33:39.030 --> 02:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
so i the document i handed out really
 
02:33:40.950 --> 02:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
consists of principles that we have
 
02:33:42.710 --> 02:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
developed and
 
02:33:45.030 --> 02:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
in evaluating what's the best thing for
 
02:33:47.990 --> 02:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
children when we're looking at replacing
 
02:33:51.750 --> 02:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
the sununu center and one of the and
 
02:33:53.830 --> 02:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's self-explanatory but one of the
 
02:33:55.349 --> 02:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
items that i really want to highlight
 
02:33:57.030 --> 02:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's been vetted
 
02:33:59.030 --> 02:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
by the senate by senate health and human
 
02:34:00.950 --> 02:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
services by the full senate by senate
 
02:34:03.510 --> 02:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
finance by the house child and family
 
02:34:06.230 --> 02:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
law section and and is announced before
 
02:34:09.510 --> 02:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
you is the notion of you know
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
safety of children and that
 
02:34:14.550 --> 02:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
what we believe is true is that a
 
02:34:16.950 --> 02:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
publicly operated facility is going to
 
02:34:19.349 --> 02:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
be able to afford children the safest
 
02:34:21.750 --> 02:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
environment and that's for a few reasons
 
02:34:23.190 --> 02:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
one is that
 
02:34:26.389 --> 02:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
if a facility is publicly owned it is
 
02:34:28.469 --> 02:34:28.479 align:start position:0%
transparent it is subject to our right
 
02:34:31.670 --> 02:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
to know law so if there are incidents
 
02:34:33.270 --> 02:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
that occur if there are lawsuits that
 
02:34:35.510 --> 02:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
are filed or settlements we can secure
 
02:34:37.270 --> 02:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
that information albeit without
 
02:34:39.590 --> 02:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
identifying information necessarily but
 
02:34:42.309 --> 02:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
we will know and things cannot be swept
 
02:34:43.750 --> 02:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
under the rug
 
02:34:46.469 --> 02:34:46.479 align:start position:0%
in addition what we know now is that our
 
02:34:48.309 --> 02:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate under our
 
02:34:51.270 --> 02:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
current state law has real-time access
 
02:34:54.309 --> 02:34:54.319 align:start position:0%
to the electronic case management
 
02:34:57.349 --> 02:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
database that the sununu center operates
 
02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
and that's really important because it
 
02:35:02.230 --> 02:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
enables them to know at a moment they
 
02:35:04.469 --> 02:35:04.479 align:start position:0%
will know if is there an incident what
 
02:35:06.309 --> 02:35:06.319 align:start position:0%
is the record what led up to it what
 
02:35:08.309 --> 02:35:08.319 align:start position:0%
happened so
 
02:35:10.469 --> 02:35:10.479 align:start position:0%
they're at the watchdog agency that is
 
02:35:12.870 --> 02:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
there to help make sure that kids on a
 
02:35:15.270 --> 02:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
daily basis are safe
 
02:35:18.309 --> 02:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
they also get real-time um
 
02:35:20.070 --> 02:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
if there is an incident it's it's
 
02:35:22.469 --> 02:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
emailed to them and they have access to
 
02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
the digital recordings for these
 
02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:25.190 align:start position:0%
the digital recordings for these
children

02:35:25.190 --> 02:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:35:28.389 --> 02:35:28.399 align:start position:0%
so these are ways that we can keep kids
 
02:35:30.230 --> 02:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
safe and that's one of the reasons that
 
02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
our group really felt that a public
 
02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
option a publicly operated facility is
 
02:35:37.190 --> 02:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
going to be the safest for kids
 
02:35:39.349 --> 02:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
so i know you're it's late so i'll let
 
02:35:40.950 --> 02:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
turn over to michelle for a bit yeah and
 
02:35:42.309 --> 02:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
i just want to highlight that all of
 
02:35:44.070 --> 02:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
that information was really
 
02:35:46.309 --> 02:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
vetted through the policy committee and
 
02:35:46.319 --> 02:35:47.190 align:start position:0%
vetted through the policy committee and
um

02:35:47.190 --> 02:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:49.190 --> 02:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
and i and i just
 
02:35:51.750 --> 02:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate what what karen said
 
02:35:53.830 --> 02:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
that that we really strongly believe
 
02:35:55.110 --> 02:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
that the public option is the right
 
02:35:59.110 --> 02:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
option um in this particular case um
 
02:36:00.309 --> 02:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
02:36:02.550 --> 02:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
i guess i have a few concerns so we one
 
02:36:04.469 --> 02:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
of the things i heard earlier was that
 
02:36:06.150 --> 02:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
was that a private facility would be
 
02:36:07.910 --> 02:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
both potentially better and cheaper it'd
 
02:36:09.270 --> 02:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
be more flexible and it would be cheaper
 
02:36:11.590 --> 02:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
and there's this presumption that a
 
02:36:13.349 --> 02:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
private facility would be able to
 
02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
operate on a per bed basis as opposed to
 
02:36:17.990 --> 02:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
a fixed cost i don't know that that's
 
02:36:19.750 --> 02:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
true and i think that that's definitely
 
02:36:21.670 --> 02:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
something that was brought up at the
 
02:36:23.510 --> 02:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
policy committee level as well that if
 
02:36:26.389 --> 02:36:26.399 align:start position:0%
we were to retrofit a private a private
 
02:36:29.830 --> 02:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
facility facility with um
 
02:36:33.349 --> 02:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
the ability to maintain a locked unit
 
02:36:35.670 --> 02:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
they're not going to agree to have one
 
02:36:37.830 --> 02:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
child there for a
 
02:36:40.309 --> 02:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
you know per bed cost and not use the
 
02:36:42.150 --> 02:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
other space that's just not going to
 
02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
happen in reality and so that's
 
02:36:45.990 --> 02:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
that was something that one of our
 
02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
partners keith kenning from waypoint
 
02:36:50.070 --> 02:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
made very clear at the policy level that
 
02:36:52.389 --> 02:36:52.399 align:start position:0%
it's just not realistic to assume that a
 
02:36:55.030 --> 02:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
private facility that runs a locked unit
 
02:36:57.590 --> 02:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
is going to operate um on anything other
 
02:36:59.429 --> 02:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
than a fixed cost so that's something
 
02:37:00.550 --> 02:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
that certainly would have to be looked
 
02:37:02.070 --> 02:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
at further before taking that at face
 
02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:03.349 align:start position:0%
at further before taking that at face
value

02:37:03.349 --> 02:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
value
 
02:37:03.359 --> 02:37:04.870 align:start position:0%
value
yep

02:37:04.870 --> 02:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:37:07.270 --> 02:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
so so would it um
 
02:37:09.830 --> 02:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
would it nevertheless be worthwhile for
 
02:37:12.469 --> 02:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
the state to issue an rfi so that we can
 
02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
go get specific answers to the issues
 
02:37:17.190 --> 02:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
that you raise or are you so convinced
 
02:37:19.030 --> 02:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
in your position that you think it would
 
02:37:22.389 --> 02:37:22.399 align:start position:0%
be a waste of time to pursue a request
 
02:37:24.790 --> 02:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
for information i think that these are
 
02:37:26.710 --> 02:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
our most vulnerable children and i
 
02:37:28.630 --> 02:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
believe that a public option is much
 
02:37:31.590 --> 02:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
safer for this particular um
 
02:37:33.670 --> 02:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
population than a private facility due
 
02:37:35.429 --> 02:37:35.439 align:start position:0%
to the oversight by the office of the
 
02:37:37.750 --> 02:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
child advocate i don't want to return to
 
02:37:40.710 --> 02:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
a place where this where um any facility
 
02:37:42.150 --> 02:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
whether it's the state or a private
 
02:37:44.309 --> 02:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
facility is facing the type of lawsuits
 
02:37:46.309 --> 02:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
that are that this state is facing right
 
02:37:49.030 --> 02:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
now and if we put our most vulnerable
 
02:37:50.469 --> 02:37:50.479 align:start position:0%
children back in a facility where
 
02:37:52.870 --> 02:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
there's less oversight maybe the state
 
02:37:54.870 --> 02:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't get sued but the children are no
 
02:37:58.150 --> 02:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
better off so one i think that the
 
02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
private facility is not right for the
 
02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
children two i don't think that we're
 
02:38:02.550 --> 02:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
going to get the finance the the
 
02:38:05.190 --> 02:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
financial perspective that um that folks
 
02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
are promising here
 
02:38:08.790 --> 02:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarity and another
 
02:38:10.389 --> 02:38:10.399 align:start position:0%
thing to keep in mind representative
 
02:38:13.830 --> 02:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
weiler had a question hold
 
02:38:15.429 --> 02:38:15.439 align:start position:0%
read a lot of audits
 
02:38:17.910 --> 02:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
10 or 12 every year for the last 15
 
02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:18.870 align:start position:0%
10 or 12 every year for the last 15
years

02:38:18.870 --> 02:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:38:20.309 --> 02:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
i don't have near
 
02:38:22.790 --> 02:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
the confidence and accountability in
 
02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:24.309 align:start position:0%
the confidence and accountability in
state

02:38:24.309 --> 02:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:38:24.319 --> 02:38:25.670 align:start position:0%
state
operated

02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
operated
 
02:38:27.910 --> 02:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
operations as you do thank you i didn't
 
02:38:29.750 --> 02:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
either until the office of the child
 
02:38:32.389 --> 02:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
advocate came into existence and i there
 
02:38:34.790 --> 02:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
are many many times that i agree i
 
02:38:38.630 --> 02:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
disagree with the department um we
 
02:38:40.309 --> 02:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
there are many occasions that we don't
 
02:38:43.110 --> 02:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
agree but on the safety of a private
 
02:38:45.190 --> 02:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
facility the way that the law is
 
02:38:47.590 --> 02:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
currently today with the oversight that
 
02:38:49.349 --> 02:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
exists currently today and the
 
02:38:51.750 --> 02:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
transparency that exists currently today
 
02:38:53.590 --> 02:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
i do have more faith in them over
 
02:38:55.830 --> 02:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
private facilities there was some
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier that private
 
02:38:59.270 --> 02:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
facilities may be equipped to begin
 
02:39:01.270 --> 02:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
taking these individuals
 
02:39:01.280 --> 02:39:02.389 align:start position:0%
taking these individuals
today

02:39:02.389 --> 02:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:39:05.270 --> 02:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
or or upon passage of this law to have a
 
02:39:07.750 --> 02:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
stop gap and i think an ert program was
 
02:39:09.910 --> 02:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned i work with children who have
 
02:39:12.469 --> 02:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
been in ert programs they do not feel
 
02:39:15.429 --> 02:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
safe and in fact when when they are
 
02:39:17.750 --> 02:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
restrained in those facilities and act
 
02:39:19.510 --> 02:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
out because they are so frequently
 
02:39:21.429 --> 02:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
restrained those facilities say we
 
02:39:23.190 --> 02:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
cannot handle these children anymore and
 
02:39:25.270 --> 02:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
they wind up in the sununu center so i
 
02:39:27.429 --> 02:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
have no con confidence that the
 
02:39:29.429 --> 02:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
facilities that are operating at ert
 
02:39:31.670 --> 02:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
facilities today are going to be able to
 
02:39:34.870 --> 02:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
handle the the children without
 
02:39:37.750 --> 02:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
and and if and if they
 
02:39:39.270 --> 02:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
and if they
 
02:39:42.309 --> 02:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
we give them a contract to take these
 
02:39:42.319 --> 02:39:43.270 align:start position:0%
we give them a contract to take these
children

02:39:43.270 --> 02:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:44.389 align:start position:0%
children
and

02:39:44.389 --> 02:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:46.790 --> 02:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
they have not changed their programming
 
02:39:49.349 --> 02:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
in a way that is more con conducive to a
 
02:39:52.150 --> 02:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
therapeutic approach what is our all our
 
02:39:54.790 --> 02:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
alternative so if we close the sununu
 
02:39:56.870 --> 02:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
center and we assign a contract to a
 
02:39:59.670 --> 02:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
private facility which today is known
 
02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
for restraining children and then
 
02:40:04.630 --> 02:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
putting them back into the sununu center
 
02:40:06.230 --> 02:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
because they can't they say they can't
 
02:40:08.230 --> 02:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
manage them what is the alternative it's
 
02:40:09.990 --> 02:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
to send them out of state and i think
 
02:40:11.750 --> 02:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's a very dangerous proposition that
 
02:40:13.190 --> 02:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be thought through very
 
02:40:15.510 --> 02:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
carefully before we go down that path
 
02:40:17.269 --> 02:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
and assume that that is the right way to
 
02:40:17.279 --> 02:40:18.150 align:start position:0%
and assume that that is the right way to
go

02:40:18.150 --> 02:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:40:18.160 --> 02:40:19.030 align:start position:0%
go
um

02:40:19.030 --> 02:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:21.349 --> 02:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
i the the other cons and i and i guess
 
02:40:23.030 --> 02:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
if you have any other you you make a
 
02:40:25.910 --> 02:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
very compelling argument there are
 
02:40:29.670 --> 02:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
advocates for privatization so so that
 
02:40:31.750 --> 02:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
people might be able to follow up with
 
02:40:34.710 --> 02:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
you uh and and explore that on kind of a
 
02:40:37.110 --> 02:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
one-to-one basis will you make sure that
 
02:40:39.110 --> 02:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
we have your contact information because
 
02:40:41.349 --> 02:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
i'd like to make sure that the the
 
02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
advocates of privatization know how to
 
02:40:45.990 --> 02:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
contact you absolutely all right thank
 
02:40:47.750 --> 02:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
you absolutely i mean another thing to
 
02:40:49.510 --> 02:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
keep in mind is that as a state we have
 
02:40:51.590 --> 02:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
decided not to privatize the way we
 
02:40:53.110 --> 02:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
treat people who are in our secure
 
02:40:54.950 --> 02:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit
 
02:40:56.710 --> 02:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
this session that's a bill that's been
 
02:40:58.710 --> 02:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
before you we've also decided not to
 
02:41:00.790 --> 02:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
privatize our prisons and i think for
 
02:41:02.790 --> 02:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
similar reasons that we don't want
 
02:41:06.150 --> 02:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
private entities to make profits or cut
 
02:41:07.830 --> 02:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
corners when it comes to some really
 
02:41:10.870 --> 02:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:10.880 --> 02:41:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:41:14.070 --> 02:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
let it stipulate that you've made your
 
02:41:15.910 --> 02:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
argument in a complete and compelling
 
02:41:17.990 --> 02:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
way what's your next point
 
02:41:19.750 --> 02:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
the only other thing i will say and and
 
02:41:22.309 --> 02:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
i know that um the the 254 amendment got
 
02:41:24.870 --> 02:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
added on very quickly um i i'd been
 
02:41:26.550 --> 02:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
aware of that i had not previously been
 
02:41:28.870 --> 02:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
involved in in any
 
02:41:31.830 --> 02:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
policy advocacy relating to 254 but i
 
02:41:33.670 --> 02:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
did reach out to the policy to certain
 
02:41:35.190 --> 02:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
members of the policy committee who i
 
02:41:38.389 --> 02:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
knew continued to work on on this bill
 
02:41:41.429 --> 02:41:41.439 align:start position:0%
following the committee vote or i guess
 
02:41:43.190 --> 02:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
i actually was yesterday after the house
 
02:41:45.670 --> 02:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
vote and i did just raise one concern i
 
02:41:47.670 --> 02:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
have over that language i think there's
 
02:41:49.990 --> 02:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
a few confusing parts but overall i
 
02:41:52.550 --> 02:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
think i think it gets to a good place i
 
02:41:54.309 --> 02:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
think i share some of the department's
 
02:41:57.030 --> 02:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
concerns about unintended consequences
 
02:41:59.750 --> 02:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
but my my main concern that i want to
 
02:42:02.550 --> 02:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
put forward is that
 
02:42:04.070 --> 02:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
the way that the law is currently
 
02:42:06.550 --> 02:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
written would allow only children who
 
02:42:08.950 --> 02:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
are convicted of felony level of
 
02:42:11.830 --> 02:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
offenses to go to the sununu center
 
02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
and i think you just heard from from
 
02:42:15.670 --> 02:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
director ribson that there are a number
 
02:42:18.309 --> 02:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
of children who are
 
02:42:18.319 --> 02:42:19.429 align:start position:0%
of children who are
who

02:42:19.429 --> 02:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:42:21.429 --> 02:42:21.439 align:start position:0%
are charged with felony offenses who
 
02:42:24.790 --> 02:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
then plead to misdemeanor level offenses
 
02:42:26.870 --> 02:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
who who the judge will send to the
 
02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:27.990 align:start position:0%
who who the judge will send to the
department

02:42:27.990 --> 02:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:42:30.070 --> 02:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
but if they have felony level
 
02:42:33.349 --> 02:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
convictions it could lead to a number of
 
02:42:35.910 --> 02:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences some are which
 
02:42:35.920 --> 02:42:36.790 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences some are which
are

02:42:36.790 --> 02:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:42:39.510 --> 02:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
lifelong and incredibly severe so the
 
02:42:42.230 --> 02:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
one thing i would ask is that the
 
02:42:44.230 --> 02:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
committee consider an amendment that
 
02:42:47.349 --> 02:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
would allow a stop gap that if a child
 
02:42:49.590 --> 02:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
were to plead from a felony level of
 
02:42:51.429 --> 02:42:51.439 align:start position:0%
offense to a misdemeanor level of
 
02:42:55.110 --> 02:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
offense and the judge expressly finds
 
02:42:57.190 --> 02:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
that such a plea agreement is in the
 
02:42:59.670 --> 02:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
child's best interest that that be
 
02:43:01.990 --> 02:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
permitted in the universe of
 
02:43:04.710 --> 02:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
um eligible offenses as well
 
02:43:06.309 --> 02:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to share language with
 
02:43:06.319 --> 02:43:08.150 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to share language with
that

02:43:08.150 --> 02:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:43:10.150 --> 02:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
02:43:12.309 --> 02:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
and and and i want to be clear i think
 
02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
it is a very rare child that needs
 
02:43:17.910 --> 02:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
incarceration a very rare child
 
02:43:19.910 --> 02:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
what i would like to see the state do
 
02:43:19.920 --> 02:43:20.710 align:start position:0%
what i would like to see the state do
and

02:43:20.710 --> 02:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:23.269 --> 02:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
is to continue building up the system of
 
02:43:25.830 --> 02:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
care in a way that ensures that no
 
02:43:28.389 --> 02:43:28.399 align:start position:0%
children need to be incarcerated i we're
 
02:43:30.389 --> 02:43:30.399 align:start position:0%
not there yet the system is not built
 
02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
out there
 
02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:32.389 align:start position:0%
out there
i

02:43:32.389 --> 02:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:43:34.389 --> 02:43:34.399 align:start position:0%
work in the system enough
 
02:43:35.990 --> 02:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i've represented enough children
 
02:43:39.190 --> 02:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
that as much as i can
 
02:43:41.030 --> 02:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
argue until i'm blue in the face that a
 
02:43:43.190 --> 02:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
child does not need to be incarcerated
 
02:43:45.110 --> 02:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
prosecutors are not going to agree to me
 
02:43:46.469 --> 02:43:46.479 align:start position:0%
probation officers are not going to
 
02:43:48.150 --> 02:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
agree with me and the judge is not going
 
02:43:50.230 --> 02:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
to agree with me on certain children and
 
02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:52.399 align:start position:0%
what i want to make sure
 
02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
is that we have
 
02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:55.030 align:start position:0%
is that we have
um

02:43:55.030 --> 02:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:57.910 --> 02:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
we have the ability to ch for children
 
02:44:00.389 --> 02:44:00.399 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
02:44:02.230 --> 02:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
make choices that are in their best
 
02:44:04.790 --> 02:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
interest and so if those choices are i
 
02:44:06.550 --> 02:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
agree to go to the sununu center to
 
02:44:09.349 --> 02:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
avoid lifelong collateral consequences
 
02:44:11.990 --> 02:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
they should be able to do that and
 
02:44:14.790 --> 02:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
um and and certainly if director ribsum
 
02:44:17.030 --> 02:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
is right the children are going to be
 
02:44:19.269 --> 02:44:19.279 align:start position:0%
either tried as adults or we're somehow
 
02:44:22.230 --> 02:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
going to exceed the six bed capacity i
 
02:44:24.309 --> 02:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
don't want those kids going out of state
 
02:44:26.070 --> 02:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
and so we need to make sure that if
 
02:44:29.269 --> 02:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
that's a possibility we have
 
02:44:30.469 --> 02:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
a system
 
02:44:33.429 --> 02:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
that will absorb those children
 
02:44:36.630 --> 02:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
that are committed to a locked facility
 
02:44:38.710 --> 02:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
by a judge which we do not have control
 
02:44:39.990 --> 02:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
over right now
 
02:44:41.830 --> 02:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
since you bring up the system of care
 
02:44:43.830 --> 02:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
and your encouragement for us to invest
 
02:44:47.349 --> 02:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
in it um and division three finance uh
 
02:44:50.309 --> 02:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
does the budget for the system of care
 
02:44:52.550 --> 02:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
and and i know that we put a lot of
 
02:44:54.950 --> 02:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
money into the program and because we're
 
02:44:57.110 --> 02:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
still in that budget year i i don't
 
02:44:59.349 --> 02:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
really know what the implications of all
 
02:45:01.670 --> 02:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
of that investment are but i don't think
 
02:45:04.389 --> 02:45:04.399 align:start position:0%
the system is built out yet and so just
 
02:45:07.429 --> 02:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
so you know one of my concerns about
 
02:45:11.750 --> 02:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
trusting the system of care to to be a a
 
02:45:14.389 --> 02:45:14.399 align:start position:0%
more complete replacement for the sununu
 
02:45:14.399 --> 02:45:15.269 align:start position:0%
more complete replacement for the sununu
center

02:45:15.269 --> 02:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
center
 
02:45:18.630 --> 02:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
is that it's it's not in place today we
 
02:45:21.030 --> 02:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
have workforce issues we you know
 
02:45:23.590 --> 02:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
there's we we don't have our own
 
02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
personal track record with the whole
 
02:45:28.950 --> 02:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
thing so we we might have you know bad
 
02:45:31.269 --> 02:45:31.279 align:start position:0%
actors in the system too we just don't
 
02:45:33.510 --> 02:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
we haven't we haven't flushed the system
 
02:45:36.070 --> 02:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
to really know what what's going on so
 
02:45:38.870 --> 02:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
that that's kind of my concern if if if
 
02:45:41.750 --> 02:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't mind i i
 
02:45:44.150 --> 02:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
looked at your document really quickly
 
02:45:45.910 --> 02:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:45:48.150 --> 02:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
of your four priorities
 
02:45:52.710 --> 02:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh i don't see public safety included
 
02:45:57.830 --> 02:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
number three is the safety of youth and
 
02:46:03.110 --> 02:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
i love that that that's there
 
02:46:04.950 --> 02:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
i'm just pointing out
 
02:46:06.710 --> 02:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
that this committee the whole
 
02:46:09.429 --> 02:46:09.439 align:start position:0%
legislature also has to worry about
 
02:46:12.150 --> 02:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
public safety and that doesn't seem to
 
02:46:14.710 --> 02:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
be one of your priorities at all
 
02:46:17.030 --> 02:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
and so it just
 
02:46:19.590 --> 02:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:21.429 --> 02:46:21.439 align:start position:0%
it's a worrisome thing if you don't
 
02:46:23.110 --> 02:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
think public safety is one of our
 
02:46:24.950 --> 02:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
priorities because i because i think it
 
02:46:26.950 --> 02:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
is so i don't want to go ahead to be
 
02:46:29.190 --> 02:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
clear this document was written assuming
 
02:46:31.349 --> 02:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
we need to have a facility these are the
 
02:46:33.590 --> 02:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
core values of that facility which is
 
02:46:35.349 --> 02:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
why you don't see public safety because
 
02:46:38.790 --> 02:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's taken care of by the presumption
 
02:46:40.710 --> 02:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
that there needs to still be a facility
 
02:46:42.870 --> 02:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
because we do not have that system built
 
02:46:45.750 --> 02:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
out so would you believe in the several
 
02:46:48.070 --> 02:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars we spent on the alvarez
 
02:46:50.870 --> 02:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
and marcel report the the final version
 
02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
of it when it listed all of the skills
 
02:46:55.830 --> 02:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
and people type of people and
 
02:46:59.190 --> 02:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
issues it completely skipped the fact
 
02:47:02.070 --> 02:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
that we needed the
 
02:47:04.790 --> 02:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
sort of the jailers but we needed fences
 
02:47:07.670 --> 02:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
they completely overlooked it and so we
 
02:47:10.469 --> 02:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
rejected the initial final report so
 
02:47:12.710 --> 02:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
that they could do an appendix to add
 
02:47:15.750 --> 02:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
the public security aspect so so so
 
02:47:17.590 --> 02:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
because i'm not really in this domain
 
02:47:20.389 --> 02:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
all the time it just worries me that we
 
02:47:23.830 --> 02:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
have community advocates that don't
 
02:47:26.950 --> 02:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
recognize as much as i think we ought to
 
02:47:29.990 --> 02:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
that public safety is a key
 
02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:31.670 align:start position:0%
that public safety is a key
priority

02:47:31.670 --> 02:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
priority
 
02:47:33.750 --> 02:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and this presumes that it's we're
 
02:47:35.750 --> 02:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
talking about an architecturally secure
 
02:47:37.830 --> 02:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
facility that would ensure public safety
 
02:47:40.790 --> 02:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
and that the kids who are placed in this
 
02:47:42.710 --> 02:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
facility are there
 
02:47:45.269 --> 02:47:45.279 align:start position:0%
for multiple reasons both because it's
 
02:47:46.950 --> 02:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
the least restrictive place where they
 
02:47:48.710 --> 02:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
can receive the treatment they need but
 
02:47:50.550 --> 02:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
also to
 
02:47:53.030 --> 02:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
to address the needs of the public and
 
02:47:55.750 --> 02:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
public safety so as michelle was saying
 
02:47:57.590 --> 02:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's really something that the court
 
02:47:59.510 --> 02:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
would have made a finding about and this
 
02:48:01.429 --> 02:48:01.439 align:start position:0%
really goes to
 
02:48:03.990 --> 02:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
once once a child is at that level and
 
02:48:05.910 --> 02:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
requires that level of
 
02:48:07.670 --> 02:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
of confinement
 
02:48:10.230 --> 02:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
what should that look like and
 
02:48:13.349 --> 02:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um and and i i i'm
 
02:48:15.269 --> 02:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
not being critical i'm just giving you
 
02:48:18.150 --> 02:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
an honest reaction that's all so do are
 
02:48:21.110 --> 02:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
there questions for either of these two
 
02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:22.710 align:start position:0%
there questions for either of these two
professionals

02:48:22.710 --> 02:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
02:48:26.150 --> 02:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:27.990 --> 02:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i thank you for the question
 
02:48:30.230 --> 02:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
is it accurate to say that you believe
 
02:48:32.550 --> 02:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
the current nunu center satisfies the
 
02:48:34.550 --> 02:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
concerns that you raise
 
02:48:38.070 --> 02:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
well the current no no it's not
 
02:48:39.190 --> 02:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
so we've we've had some some
 
02:48:40.950 --> 02:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
conversations with with director ripson
 
02:48:42.630 --> 02:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
about that where
 
02:48:45.030 --> 02:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
we believe that it needs to be a small
 
02:48:47.110 --> 02:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
home-like architecturally secure
 
02:48:49.030 --> 02:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
facility um
 
02:48:50.950 --> 02:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
with clinical staff
 
02:48:53.110 --> 02:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is that the youth
 
02:48:56.469 --> 02:48:56.479 align:start position:0%
counselors at the current facility
 
02:48:58.469 --> 02:48:58.479 align:start position:0%
some of them not all of them but some of
 
02:49:00.309 --> 02:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
them are still more of the correction
 
02:49:03.030 --> 02:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
officer mindset as opposed to
 
02:49:03.040 --> 02:49:04.230 align:start position:0%
officer mindset as opposed to
um

02:49:04.230 --> 02:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:05.750 --> 02:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
02:49:05.760 --> 02:49:06.630 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
um

02:49:06.630 --> 02:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:09.510 --> 02:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
clinical staff that are familiar with
 
02:49:11.429 --> 02:49:11.439 align:start position:0%
adolescent brain science and the needs
 
02:49:14.150 --> 02:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
of this specific population of youth and
 
02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:15.030 align:start position:0%
of this specific population of youth and
it

02:49:15.030 --> 02:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:49:16.870 --> 02:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
and and and to your to your point
 
02:49:19.269 --> 02:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
representative edwards i i understand
 
02:49:21.190 --> 02:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
that the need to have jailers if you
 
02:49:23.030 --> 02:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
will but when we are working with a
 
02:49:28.150 --> 02:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
youth population that is very much
 
02:49:31.990 --> 02:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
i guess most of them have disabilities
 
02:49:33.990 --> 02:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
many of them have post traumatic stress
 
02:49:36.230 --> 02:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
disorder many of them come from abusive
 
02:49:36.240 --> 02:49:37.190 align:start position:0%
disorder many of them come from abusive
homes

02:49:37.190 --> 02:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
homes
 
02:49:40.309 --> 02:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
and so the mindset for that population
 
02:49:42.950 --> 02:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
of youth needs to be much different for
 
02:49:45.750 --> 02:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
the ptsd kids if you if
 
02:49:49.750 --> 02:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
if if you approach them too quickly in a
 
02:49:51.670 --> 02:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
you know in a correction officer mindset
 
02:49:53.110 --> 02:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to react and that's just
 
02:49:54.550 --> 02:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
part of their disability
 
02:49:56.230 --> 02:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
and they're going to get into a tussle
 
02:49:58.070 --> 02:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to get into a fight and
 
02:49:59.830 --> 02:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to become a very unsafe
 
02:50:02.550 --> 02:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
situation both for the child and for
 
02:50:04.550 --> 02:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
the correction officer which is why it
 
02:50:07.590 --> 02:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
is so important to have a
 
02:50:09.190 --> 02:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
new model that incorporates
 
02:50:12.150 --> 02:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practices and relies upon
 
02:50:13.750 --> 02:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
um trained
 
02:50:15.990 --> 02:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
staff or staff who are trained to work
 
02:50:17.670 --> 02:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
with this very specific population of
 
02:50:17.680 --> 02:50:18.710 align:start position:0%
with this very specific population of
youth

02:50:18.710 --> 02:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
youth
 
02:50:20.469 --> 02:50:20.479 align:start position:0%
in com from conversations with director
 
02:50:22.070 --> 02:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
ribsum i think we are moving there i
 
02:50:24.550 --> 02:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
don't think we're there yet um but but
 
02:50:26.630 --> 02:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
the language in this bill says that we
 
02:50:28.710 --> 02:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
will continue moving forward there today
 
02:50:32.150 --> 02:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
with an end date of i think march 2023
 
02:50:34.790 --> 02:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
um so that that model will be ready to
 
02:50:36.950 --> 02:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
go in the new facility
 
02:50:38.389 --> 02:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
so is it necessary to build a new
 
02:50:40.550 --> 02:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
facility to accomplish the goal you just
 
02:50:42.389 --> 02:50:42.399 align:start position:0%
described well it is because the
 
02:50:44.230 --> 02:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
facility that we're currently operating
 
02:50:46.309 --> 02:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
is not home like it's not a therapeutic
 
02:50:48.230 --> 02:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
environment it really does feel like a
 
02:50:49.750 --> 02:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
jail i don't know if you've been in
 
02:50:53.030 --> 02:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
there and gone but it's yeah it feels
 
02:50:55.269 --> 02:50:55.279 align:start position:0%
like a correctional facility it's also
 
02:50:57.429 --> 02:50:57.439 align:start position:0%
way too big and it's really expensive
 
02:50:58.630 --> 02:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
and that's something that you all do
 
02:51:00.630 --> 02:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
care about right it's on a huge campus
 
02:51:02.790 --> 02:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
that needs to be maintained and a very
 
02:51:06.550 --> 02:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
much larger facility than we need
 
02:51:08.150 --> 02:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
but just addressing the facility not the
 
02:51:08.160 --> 02:51:10.389 align:start position:0%
but just addressing the facility not the
campus

02:51:10.389 --> 02:51:10.399 align:start position:0%
campus
 
02:51:12.710 --> 02:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's not appropriate because it is
 
02:51:14.790 --> 02:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
more like a jail than a than a
 
02:51:17.429 --> 02:51:17.439 align:start position:0%
therapeutic facility and i would like
 
02:51:19.190 --> 02:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
what you know but we need something
 
02:51:23.670 --> 02:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
between now and june of 2024 right so it
 
02:51:25.670 --> 02:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
what i understand is that
 
02:51:28.389 --> 02:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
at this juncture um
 
02:51:30.469 --> 02:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
that we are putting into pl they are
 
02:51:31.990 --> 02:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
putting into place evidence-based
 
02:51:33.670 --> 02:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
programs they are working on getting
 
02:51:35.030 --> 02:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
staff that are qualified they are
 
02:51:36.150 --> 02:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
contracting with dartmouth for
 
02:51:37.990 --> 02:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
psychiatric services
 
02:51:39.590 --> 02:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
and that
 
02:51:41.590 --> 02:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
what is required in this bill is that
 
02:51:43.990 --> 02:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
these all the programmatic supports and
 
02:51:46.070 --> 02:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
requirements be put into place by march
 
02:51:48.230 --> 02:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
of 2023
 
02:51:50.469 --> 02:51:50.479 align:start position:0%
so just to reassure you the the
 
02:51:53.349 --> 02:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
legislature has totally bought off on
 
02:51:54.870 --> 02:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
the idea that we need to go to a
 
02:51:56.630 --> 02:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
therapeutic model and that we're
 
02:51:58.950 --> 02:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
transitioning from a correctional
 
02:52:01.429 --> 02:52:01.439 align:start position:0%
officer mentality
 
02:52:04.070 --> 02:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
the backstop that is you know you still
 
02:52:06.550 --> 02:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
got to keep the kids in in in the
 
02:52:10.389 --> 02:52:10.399 align:start position:0%
facility and not escape so
 
02:52:10.399 --> 02:52:11.349 align:start position:0%
facility and not escape so
yeah

02:52:11.349 --> 02:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:52:13.510 --> 02:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
02:52:17.990 --> 02:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:19.990 --> 02:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:52:21.269 --> 02:52:21.279 align:start position:0%
there was a presumption here that we
 
02:52:23.110 --> 02:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
have to build a facility are you
 
02:52:25.110 --> 02:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
comfortable with rehabbing a building
 
02:52:26.710 --> 02:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
and not just starting from scratch we
 
02:52:29.510 --> 02:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't have to build from the ground up
 
02:52:31.670 --> 02:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
sure i mean i i don't think that's up to
 
02:52:33.910 --> 02:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
us because we're not construction people
 
02:52:36.630 --> 02:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
but as long as it meets all of these
 
02:52:39.830 --> 02:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
criteria and then
 
02:52:42.070 --> 02:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
that's fine okay well so you said build
 
02:52:43.349 --> 02:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
a new one that's why i just wanted to
 
02:52:45.510 --> 02:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
clarify i have no opinion on how it's
 
02:52:47.510 --> 02:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
built right
 
02:52:49.990 --> 02:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
it could be it could be rehabilitated it
 
02:52:50.790 --> 02:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
could be
 
02:52:53.429 --> 02:52:53.439 align:start position:0%
new construction um but you know it just
 
02:52:57.429 --> 02:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
needs to meet the the resident's needs
 
02:52:58.790 --> 02:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
02:53:01.830 --> 02:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
so we're rapidly approaching 6 p.m this
 
02:53:05.750 --> 02:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
has been a really informative session uh
 
02:53:08.230 --> 02:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
senator daniel's out of deference to you
 
02:53:09.990 --> 02:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
you've sat through this for nearly two
 
02:53:11.510 --> 02:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
hours do you have any comments or
 
02:53:13.429 --> 02:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
questions you'd like asked for you or
 
02:53:22.830 --> 02:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:26.469 --> 02:53:26.479 align:start position:0%
yourself good idea did you have another
 
02:53:28.950 --> 02:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
i do mr chairman i i just i just want to
 
02:53:31.670 --> 02:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
make a comment and and you know i
 
02:53:33.750 --> 02:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
started in 2004 on the children of
 
02:53:36.469 --> 02:53:36.479 align:start position:0%
family law committee i have really made
 
02:53:39.190 --> 02:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of these kinds of issues
 
02:53:41.510 --> 02:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
the focus of my career here and i want
 
02:53:43.269 --> 02:53:43.279 align:start position:0%
to keep people in mind there there's
 
02:53:44.630 --> 02:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
sort of a
 
02:53:46.630 --> 02:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
an underlying current here with some
 
02:53:47.990 --> 02:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
people that it seems like they're
 
02:53:51.429 --> 02:53:51.439 align:start position:0%
thinking more like adults we are not
 
02:53:53.429 --> 02:53:53.439 align:start position:0%
talking about adults here we're talking
 
02:53:55.670 --> 02:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
about children that have different
 
02:53:58.230 --> 02:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
mental developments different issues i
 
02:53:59.830 --> 02:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
know from all the work i've done that
 
02:54:01.429 --> 02:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
the number used to be and i suspect it's
 
02:54:03.190 --> 02:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
not much different now 80 percent of the
 
02:54:05.429 --> 02:54:05.439 align:start position:0%
kids at the sununu center have are on
 
02:54:08.870 --> 02:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
ieps they have some sort of learning
 
02:54:11.269 --> 02:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
disability issue and many of those kids
 
02:54:13.429 --> 02:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
as was testified to before
 
02:54:15.349 --> 02:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
don't have the supports at home so we've
 
02:54:17.429 --> 02:54:17.439 align:start position:0%
got kids that are coming in you know
 
02:54:19.349 --> 02:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
really without the supports that the
 
02:54:21.030 --> 02:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
kids outside the sununu center or
 
02:54:23.269 --> 02:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
outside other facilities have had
 
02:54:25.349 --> 02:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
um i also want to point out to those
 
02:54:27.510 --> 02:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
that have not done this work for so long
 
02:54:29.830 --> 02:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
that this is the nationwide trend and
 
02:54:31.750 --> 02:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
missouri was the first state to do this
 
02:54:33.190 --> 02:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
where they basically closed all their
 
02:54:34.950 --> 02:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
big institutions and put everybody into
 
02:54:37.269 --> 02:54:37.279 align:start position:0%
these smaller home-like settings
 
02:54:37.279 --> 02:54:38.230 align:start position:0%
these smaller home-like settings
and

02:54:38.230 --> 02:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:54:39.670 --> 02:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
new york city did the same thing and
 
02:54:41.510 --> 02:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
about 10 years ago or so i can't
 
02:54:42.790 --> 02:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
remember the exact year when i was chair
 
02:54:44.550 --> 02:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
of children of family law
 
02:54:46.790 --> 02:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
ncsl sent me to new york to a really
 
02:54:48.150 --> 02:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
interesting conference there were about
 
02:54:49.750 --> 02:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
40 of us from around the country and
 
02:54:51.510 --> 02:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
this chair children family i was sent
 
02:54:53.590 --> 02:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
there and we actually got to go into one
 
02:54:55.510 --> 02:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
of these facilities in brooklyn and see
 
02:54:57.190 --> 02:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
how it operates and i think there were
 
02:54:58.870 --> 02:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
six or eight kids in there
 
02:55:00.950 --> 02:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
including live-in therapists it's
 
02:55:03.030 --> 02:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
fascinating to see how it works and how
 
02:55:05.510 --> 02:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
successful it is but they were all
 
02:55:07.030 --> 02:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
focused on the fact that these are
 
02:55:08.950 --> 02:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
children we're talking about and the
 
02:55:11.030 --> 02:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
services provided were focused on
 
02:55:13.670 --> 02:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
children and here it's real easy for
 
02:55:15.990 --> 02:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
people who have not
 
02:55:17.510 --> 02:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
heard all that testimony that i've heard
 
02:55:18.870 --> 02:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
over the years or seen those kinds of
 
02:55:20.950 --> 02:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
facilities to think about having to lock
 
02:55:22.389 --> 02:55:22.399 align:start position:0%
these kids up the same way we think
 
02:55:25.910 --> 02:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
about locking up adults and these are
 
02:55:27.830 --> 02:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
broken humans that are broken as
 
02:55:29.590 --> 02:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
children and i want to keep in mind that
 
02:55:31.030 --> 02:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
what is appropriate for adults and the
 
02:55:33.030 --> 02:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
way we need to lock up adults is not the
 
02:55:35.030 --> 02:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
way we need to lock the kids up we
 
02:55:36.790 --> 02:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
certainly need to lock some of them up
 
02:55:38.630 --> 02:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
or to keep them in secure units because
 
02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
they will hurt members of the public but
 
02:55:43.349 --> 02:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
i don't want anybody here to lose sight
 
02:55:45.030 --> 02:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
of the fact that we are talking about
 
02:55:47.590 --> 02:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
locking up children and it is done
 
02:55:49.990 --> 02:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
differently it has different effects and
 
02:55:51.349 --> 02:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
and the approach should be very
 
02:55:53.190 --> 02:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
different than the way approach we take
 
02:55:55.030 --> 02:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
with adults so i know that's a little
 
02:55:56.230 --> 02:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
lecture but
 
02:55:57.590 --> 02:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
it comes from the heart and i needed to
 
02:56:00.070 --> 02:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
say it sure i'm glad you did i and i'll
 
02:56:01.510 --> 02:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
i'll just share with you that when i
 
02:56:04.630 --> 02:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
came off active duty in the army in 1991
 
02:56:07.269 --> 02:56:07.279 align:start position:0%
my wife and i were approved to be uh
 
02:56:09.670 --> 02:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
house parents at boys town university in
 
02:56:12.710 --> 02:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
omaha and then after some calculation of
 
02:56:14.950 --> 02:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
what we needed for our family we just
 
02:56:17.110 --> 02:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford it so
 
02:56:19.750 --> 02:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
so i love the boys town model and i wish
 
02:56:22.550 --> 02:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
boys town would come to new hampshire so
 
02:56:24.230 --> 02:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
02:56:25.910 --> 02:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
she and i both went through foster
 
02:56:27.990 --> 02:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
training and so we understand that these
 
02:56:29.830 --> 02:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
kids are different and i think division
 
02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:31.110 align:start position:0%
kids are different and i think division
three

02:56:31.110 --> 02:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:56:32.950 --> 02:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
you haven't you didn't spend last budget
 
02:56:35.429 --> 02:56:35.439 align:start position:0%
year with us but i i i would like to
 
02:56:37.750 --> 02:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
think that while we were signing
 
02:56:39.750 --> 02:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
resources we were doing it from a
 
02:56:42.389 --> 02:56:42.399 align:start position:0%
compassionate therapeutic perspective
 
02:56:44.550 --> 02:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
we did not undercut
 
02:56:47.030 --> 02:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
any direct health care activities for
 
02:56:47.040 --> 02:56:54.150 align:start position:0%
any direct health care activities for
example

02:56:54.150 --> 02:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:55.910 --> 02:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
at this point i think everyone's had
 
02:56:57.750 --> 02:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
their opportunity to say something and
 
02:56:59.349 --> 02:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
they're just done
 
02:57:02.389 --> 02:57:02.399 align:start position:0%
so uh i will uh
 
02:57:04.950 --> 02:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
adjourn today's work session with the
 
02:57:07.510 --> 02:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
expectation that we may have something
 
02:57:09.269 --> 02:57:09.279 align:start position:0%
that looks like an amendment on monday
 
02:57:10.710 --> 02:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
or tuesday
 
02:57:12.870 --> 02:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh but whatever we do it's got to be
 
02:57:15.590 --> 02:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
done by tuesday night so that the full
