uh before we open if you don't mind um i
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
see we do have some guests online if you
 
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
want to explain
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know like if we do any exact or you
 
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
know that they have to be on
 
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
you know the rules of the video
 
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.830 align:start position:0%
you know the rules of the video
so

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes the question the matter is
 
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
puts a question at that point in time
 
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
because a member is not in their seat
 
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
according to rule 107 that member is not
 
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
permitted to vote
 
00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 align:start position:0%
for the members participating remotely
 
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
your device
 
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
the camera has to be on
 
00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
in order when you're executing so if the
 
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
tim is not on
 
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
when the matter is put discretion you
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
will be considered to not be in your
 
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.070 align:start position:0%
will be considered to not be in your
seat

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
seat
 
00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
i i would say for the plane of
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
transparency involved in an executive
 
00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
session i would
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
recommend that all members
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
just didn't really keep their devices
 
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
the cameras on at that time
 
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
so that that's a strict rule and it
 
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
would be strictly enforced
 
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
and it has been um
 
00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 align:start position:0%
the other the other rule that i would
 
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
just emphasize before we begin if
 
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
someone wishes to to ask a question of
 
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.749 align:start position:0%
someone wishes to to ask a question of
uh

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
someone testifying
 
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
you're not committed to debate the
 
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.150 align:start position:0%
you're not committed to debate the
witness

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
witness
 
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
you're also not recognized to make a
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
statement if the member is recognized to
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
ask a question i expect it to be a
 
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
question if a statement is made and not
 
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
a question i will
 
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
i assume you don't understand that so i
 
00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%

a permanent fixture
 
00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:35.599 align:start position:0%

00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
taxpayers extra dollars and i can speak
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
to that a little bit more later
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
that duplicates the fbi nick system
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
and is unnecessary
 
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
and which in fact has failed on numerous
 
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
occasions and in fact resulted in
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
injuries by firearms to law enforcement
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
a system
 
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.029 align:start position:0%
a system
which

00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:30.070 align:start position:0%
which
currently

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
this is a system which currently uh
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
operates in fact without statutory
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
authority or agency rule
 
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
when one reads rsa
 
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.589 align:start position:0%
when one reads rsa
159

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
159
 
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
one finds that the gun line is only
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
authorized to perform knicks checks
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
the agency has in fact the gun line has
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
we'll speak to that a little bit more
 
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.790 align:start position:0%
we'll speak to that a little bit more
later

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
this bill has
 
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
very strong support
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
throughout the state uh
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
the uh there will be testimony later on
 
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:11.829 align:start position:0%
the uh there will be testimony later on
from

00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh firearms store uh owners
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh and others uh who will
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
share with you
 
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh their stories uh and the inordinate
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
delays that have taken place over the
 
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.790 align:start position:0%
delays that have taken place over the
years

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
as well the fact that when when the
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
problem arises because of these
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
inordinate delays
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
the gun line responds and then a while
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
later it falls back into its own ways
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
the old ways and those delays
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
are an infringement on the second
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
amendment uh there are delays both in
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
the purchasing of firearms initially and
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
in the restoration of those firearms to
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
individuals from whom they have been
 
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.750 align:start position:0%
individuals from whom they have been
confiscated

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
confiscated
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
under domestic violence or stalking
 
00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:54.949 align:start position:0%
under domestic violence or stalking
orders

00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
i'm in receipt of
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
a document which i believe each of you
 
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
received from the combined offices of
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
doj and safety yesterday afternoon
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
that document is an affirmation
 
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
of the activities of the gun line
 
00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
in testimony before the senate
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.350 align:start position:0%
 
stated

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
stated
 
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.069 align:start position:0%
stated
that

00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.079 --> 00:10:21.110 align:start position:0%
 
without

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
authority the gun line continues to
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
operate and
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
that the gun line in fact exists in
 
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
large part
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
because the court system
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
maintains a hundred and seventy thousand
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
name database 170 000 records
 
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
that are inaccurate and have never been
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
disposed of and never received the
 
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
proper disposition
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
so the gun line is actually in in fact
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
covering for the ineptitude of the court
 
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.350 align:start position:0%
covering for the ineptitude of the court
system

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
to police its own records that in and of
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
itself should be concerning
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
the gun line removes uh gets removed and
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
in place we we
 
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
replace the sheriffs
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh as
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
the performers of background checks
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
the court ordered interactions with uh
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
gun owners for example domestic violence
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
or stalking orders when guns are seized
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
and uh the bill provides funding for the
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
sheriff for six months
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh and a six-month gap between that
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
funding and the actual
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
disestablishment of the state police gun
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
line to enable any administrative
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
operational technical
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.509 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
sheriffs have had concerns as as have
 
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.030 align:start position:0%
sheriffs have had concerns as as have
the

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
local police we have addressed those
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
concerns with amendments to the original
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
bill and those amendments are contained
 
00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:48.290 align:start position:0%
in the version that you have
 
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:49.829 align:start position:0%
in the version that you have
[Music]

00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
that's the current amended version from
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.030 align:start position:0%
the senate
so

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
the system
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
will allow in fact will require the
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
courts instead of submitting domestic
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
violence orders and releases there from
 
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
and stalking orders and releases there
 
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.030 align:start position:0%
and stalking orders and releases there
from

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.310 align:start position:0%
from
to

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
uh the gun line
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh they will be directly sent
 
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.470 align:start position:0%
uh they will be directly sent
to

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
the gun line for
 
00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
forwarding to the nix system so that
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
they're in the next system very rapidly
 
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
currently there are delays in those
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
records being forwarded which of course
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
those who are the subject of those
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
protective orders
 
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
so what we do is we make the system much
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
more streamlined
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
much less expensive
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
and much more in line with the
 
00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
constitutional freedoms we do away with
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
a system that is not authorized by
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
statute or rule to operate currently in
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
state government
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
and in so doing
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
we cause no harm we increase no danger
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
to those who may be threatened
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
we do in fact do a great service for
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
those who practice the second amendment
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
within our state
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
we'll speak for just a moment to costs
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh in this year's budget uh the
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh department has added two positions
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh costing roughly two hundred thousand
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
to the gun line
 
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
in addition they pulled eight troopers
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
off the line to deal with a backlog at a
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
cost of in excess of two hundred
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in the in this this
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
present fiscal year
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
uh and and again
 
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
i reiterate that the system
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh is not even authorized to operate as
 
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
it is under law it is only authorized
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
under 159 to perform the next checks as
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
a point of contact defined under federal
 
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.949 align:start position:0%
a point of contact defined under federal
law

00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
and so without further further ado i'm
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
going to go ahead and accept any
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
questions mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:49.660 align:start position:0%
thank you sir for your testimony
 
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.069 align:start position:0%
thank you sir for your testimony
[Music]

00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
representative true you're recognized
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
so is that the cost of the my question
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
is is is the 400 000 the annual cost of
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry could you repeat the question
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
cost of uh 200 000
 
00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:20.150 align:start position:0%
cost of uh 200 000
personnel

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
yeah the state troopers was it was a
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
one-time cost
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh brought they were brought in to
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh to do the background checks that
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
weren't being done to catch up on this
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
huge backlog
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
and um i am fairly certain that they may
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
have been released back to their
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
original posts
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
but the department will probably uh
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
convert it can uh you know testify to
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
that effect the two hundred thousand
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
dollars a year will of course go up
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
paying benefits for two full-time clerks
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
as well as those there currently uh and
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
here we grow government uh not
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
authorized by statute or a rule
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh in a system that has done background
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
checks that are not authorized and far
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
exceed uh any authorization under the
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
nyx system
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh we repair
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:08.710 align:start position:0%
uh the
um

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
i should say we improve the
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
delivery of
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
court-ordered records uh protective
 
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.590 align:start position:0%
court-ordered records uh protective
orders

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
orders
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
to the unix system so that it is
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
basically instantly available within 24
 
00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:23.750 align:start position:0%
basically instantly available within 24
hours

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:25.839 align:start position:0%
for checking by anyone that might do a
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
background check as an ffl
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
um a federal firearms licensed dealer in
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
the state and so
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
again we we make the system much more
 
00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
efficient much less expensive and much
 
00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:37.990 align:start position:0%
efficient much less expensive and much
more

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
in line with the constitutional rights
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
under uh under ours and the federal
 
00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:43.430 align:start position:0%
under uh under ours and the federal
constitutions

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
constitutions
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
representative recognized for a
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
follow-up question thank you mr chair
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you again
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to get a feel for the
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
you're looking at
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh 200 000 a year
 
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.670 align:start position:0%
uh 200 000 a year
for

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.269 align:start position:0%
for
the

00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
state police clerks i'm not certain if
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
any other personnel would be
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh eliminated from their positions uh in
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
that particular agency
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh that's a possibility
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
we do look at the possibility of um
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
cost to the sheriff's department but as
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
i said we've provided ten thousand
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
dollars to each of the ten sheriff's
 
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
departments initially for startup costs
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
in terms of equipment uh the portals to
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
the fbi training for their personnel uh
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
and in the six-month uh after that we
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
will find out
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh exactly what other costs may be
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
coming along uh again the total number
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
of checks that the sheriffs would do
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
right now is between 450 and 500 a year
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
that's across all counties
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh and so there may be an you know an
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
adjustment of funding if necessary
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
but the time taken to do these next
 
00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:00.629 align:start position:0%
but the time taken to do these next
checks

00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
checks
 
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
is very very short
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
under the federal system and so i'm not
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
certain that there would be any cost
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
from the sheriff's but we'll adjust to
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
representatives did you have your hand
 
00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.309 align:start position:0%
representatives did you have your hand
up

00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:21.590 align:start position:0%
up
yes

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh senator
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
i was curious to why you put it in the
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
sheriff's hands
 
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
representative and it's good to see you
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh the sheriffs are located
 
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
at the court system basically all right
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
and for that reason
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of efficiencies
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
when the court makes an adjudication the
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
sheriffs are on scene basically
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
instantly once they get the record from
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
the court and they can go to work to
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
process whatever it is that needs to be
 
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.909 align:start position:0%
process whatever it is that needs to be
done

00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
thank you uh senator is this going to
 
00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:07.830 align:start position:0%
thank you uh senator is this going to
bring

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
bring
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
any extra
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
from the counties
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
that take care of the shares
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
no uh no this should not bring any
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money from the from the
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
counties uh
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
it should not cost the counties any
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
money that's the way i should put it and
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh as i said we'll we'll figure out
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what the time and uh you know
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
cost constraints uh or cost may be and i
 
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
believe that the state would
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
um certainly
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
cover that cost because it's part of our
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
representative memes you recognize for a
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
question yes
 
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you senator for
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.789 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i'm curious about
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
is that as i read the bill it doesn't
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
look like the role of the department of
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
safety is completely eliminated
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
so in the case of domestic
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
violence protection orders uh they
 
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
appear to have a role if the county if
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
county officials can't uh or the county
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
sheriff will take longer than 24 hours
 
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
to actually transmit domestic violence
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
protection order information into the
 
00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.789 align:start position:0%
protection order information into the
system

00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh and it also says that uh
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
bottom line is there are several uh
 
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
areas uh within the bill
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
where the role of the state police and
 
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
the department of safety appear to be
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
preserved so i guess my question is is
 
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh are we really eliminating all of
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
these costs and and what exactly
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
is getting eliminated and why the
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
decision to let some things
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
remain with the department of safety but
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
to take other things away before before
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
this hearing it gets
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
it's out of hand representing the news
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
one question at a time for witness
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
you'll be recognized for a follow-up
 
00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:01.510 align:start position:0%
you'll be recognized for a follow-up
question

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
so just to make sure there's nothing
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
just there's three questions asked
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:20:08.789 --> 00:20:08.799 align:start position:0%
question so just make sure the witness
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
that understands the questions let's
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
keep it
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm going to try to address
 
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
them as i remember them um
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
the first question yes there is a rule
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
for the state police
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
uh and it is uh
 
00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:23.060 align:start position:0%
uh and it is uh
to

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:23.070 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:25.110 align:start position:0%
to
[Music]

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
take the domestic violence orders
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay and insert them into nics
 
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.669 align:start position:0%
okay and insert them into nics
um

00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
if the court has not and there will
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
again i think there'll be personnel that
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
follow on that have a better
 
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
understanding of that process because uh
 
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:39.990 align:start position:0%
understanding of that process because uh
the

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
intricacies of it
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh are substantial at present but right
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
now the state police would be recipients
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
of domestic orders and and put them into
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh the state plea and into the nick
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.390 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm just curious why that would even
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
be necessary if the county officials are
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
are you know are doing what they're
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing under the way that
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
the bill is written um why do you need
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
the state police to serve as a backup
 
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.029 align:start position:0%
the state police to serve as a backup
um

00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't know
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't need it uh i would say that
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
you know if you think there's a way that
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
we can eliminate that i'm certainly
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
amenable to that
 
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.390 align:start position:0%
amenable to that
um

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
again it would provide a central
 
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.510 align:start position:0%
again it would provide a central
database

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
database
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
for all domestic violence
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
and orders
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
and we don't have that at present it
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
certainly would not be the intent of
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
this bill to allow them to pursue any
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
other investigative capacity but it
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
would serve as a repository for all
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
domestic and stalking orders in the
 
00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.390 align:start position:0%
domestic and stalking orders in the
state

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that that doesn't
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
currently exist that they're
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
and i could be wrong but i think they're
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
maintained at the respective county
 
00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.710 align:start position:0%
maintained at the respective county
levels

00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
levels
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
so that would be one benefit of that but
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
i'll let
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
subsequent testimony address that issue
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
representative also you're recognized
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you mr chairman
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for taking my question
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
so i'm actually on page one of your bill
 
00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
and my i am
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm looking at
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
line eight in under findings
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
and my question is
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
you have um in your
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
preamble here
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
on part two the gun lines inefficiencies
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
have created significant delays
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm curious and could you please
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
define what that means what is a
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
significant delay
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
um and why that how that made it into
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
the writing of this bill and is
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
you know is that the problem this bill
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
is solving
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
that was the net that was the origin of
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
the request from many people to to to
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
write this legislation
 
00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:12.950 align:start position:0%
write this legislation
uh

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
there were
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
many times where the initial purchase
 
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
would wait days
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh which in and of itself creates a
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
threat and i think further testimony by
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
subsequent uh witnesses will will attest
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.710 align:start position:0%
to this
um

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
but it created really inordinate delays
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
in the domestic violence and stalking
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
order return of weapons as long as a
 
00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.669 align:start position:0%
order return of weapons as long as a
year

00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
people would put in the required
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
paperwork and would take as much as a
 
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.029 align:start position:0%
paperwork and would take as much as a
year

00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
i'm led to believe uh that that
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
the improvements instituted by the
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
department subsequent to the
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
introduction of this legislation
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
has significantly reduced those times
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
again though at additional cost and and
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
beyond the scope of any statute or rule
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
may follow up mr chair representative
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a follow-up
 
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.350 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a follow-up
question

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair um thank
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
you senator guida um
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
i appreciate
 
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
your response to the last question and
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
now i want to switch gears a little bit
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to line 22 on page 1 which
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.870 align:start position:0%
i believe
um

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:32.390 align:start position:0%
um
references

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
close to the
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
references the fiscal note um
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
on page five
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
so on line 22 it says this bill saves
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
tax dollars
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
from the outset from where i'm sitting
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
and i've and i'm actually
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough just got my
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
rockingham county budget
 
00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh in my hand it arrived the other day
 
00:24:59.279 --> 00:25:01.430 align:start position:0%
uh in my hand it arrived the other day
and

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
after having read this
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
legislation it appears and perhaps you
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
can correct me
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
as to how i'm maybe not understanding
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
your intent
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
but it looks like
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
it looks like
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
the downshifting of this responsibility
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
out of the department of safety
 
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
responsibility down to the sheriff's
 
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
departments which would then be county
 
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.430 align:start position:0%
departments which would then be county
responsibilities

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
is this a question or is there a
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
question coming
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
so in your
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
testimony to i believe
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
um representative muse
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
you um you had said that there may
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
or may not be more money
 
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:54.630 align:start position:0%
or may not be more money
for

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
counties coming out of the state budget
 
00:25:57.039 --> 00:25:58.149 align:start position:0%
counties coming out of the state budget
and

00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
have the
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
county sheriff's embraced this
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
downshifting of responsibility to the
 
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.750 align:start position:0%
downshifting of responsibility to the
county

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
is it is there a question from him you
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
just asked i just asked that question
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
as to the downshifting as i said that we
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
have an initial um
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
outlay of ten thousand dollars per
 
00:26:18.159 --> 00:26:19.110 align:start position:0%
outlay of ten thousand dollars per
county

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
to get the system up and running and any
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
administrative costs related there to
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
personnel training and so forth
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh subsequent costs i have i have told
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
the sheriffs that i will pursue and i'm
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
sure that the state
 
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:33.990 align:start position:0%
sure that the state
will

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.029 align:start position:0%
will
fund

00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
any additional costs
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
bearing in mind that
 
00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.630 align:start position:0%
bearing in mind that
uh

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
the the costs
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
of doing a knicks check
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
are negligible in terms of time
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
it might take three minutes four minutes
 
00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
and even if you equate that uh you know
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
those are costs that are that are
 
00:26:54.559 --> 00:26:56.149 align:start position:0%
those are costs that are that are
manageable

00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
manageable
 
00:26:56.159 --> 00:26:56.950 align:start position:0%
manageable
so

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
any cost downshifting to the sheriff's
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
will be funded by the state
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh as i think they must uh it's a state
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
court system that makes these
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
adjudications that require this
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
work by the sheriffs
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
i believe the state has the obligation
 
00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
currently

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
all long guns go through nicks from the
 
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.070 align:start position:0%
all long guns go through nicks from the
dealer

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
and all
 
00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:38.950 align:start position:0%
and all
handguns

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
handguns
 
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
go through the new hampshire state
 
00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.830 align:start position:0%
go through the new hampshire state
police

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
police
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
but can you also explain
 
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
that bottom line the new hampshire state
 
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.510 align:start position:0%
that bottom line the new hampshire state
police

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
police
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
goes to nix
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
so they're more or less a middleman
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
is that a question yeah
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
yeah the system is such
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
the next system allows the establishment
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
of point of contact the point of
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
conquest is law enforcement agency
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
that's authorized to conduct the mix
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
checks okay as an interim as an
 
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.430 align:start position:0%
checks okay as an interim as an
interface

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
interface
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
many states are purely
 
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
directly from the purchase point two
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
nicks some states have points of contact
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
and in our state statute you find that
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
the point of contact legislation i'm
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
sorry a law in the 159
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
only authorizes the department to use to
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
do nix checks all right and they that
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
next system queries three different
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
background uh three different databases
 
00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.669 align:start position:0%
background uh three different databases
for

00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh potential violations that would
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
disqualify a purchaser so
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh yeah uh the
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
the state police do the next check and
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
and then they do other checks that are
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
not authorized in statute in fact they'd
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
really gotten out of line uh and and
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
were out in fact going back to states of
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
residence and states of birth of people
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
way outside the scope of anything that's
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
that's uh rational
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh and so
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
that's another reason that we decided to
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
put this legislation in
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
bring them into conformity with the
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
existing law that only authorizes the
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.549 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:29:16.559 --> 00:29:17.669 align:start position:0%
follow-up
representative

00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up question thank you mr
 
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.029 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up question thank you mr
chairman

00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh senator
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
bottom line
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
can new hampshire let's say knicks got
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
shut down
 
00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
can new hampshire do their own
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
background checks without knicks
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
the answer is a categoric no
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
in fact in the legislation currently
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
under consideration at the federal
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
congress uh there's an extension up to
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
ten days
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
uh uh before um you know of a delay
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh it had been suggested by some that
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
that doesn't apply to the state police
 
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
gun line that's categorically false the
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
state police gun line as a point of
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
contact is subject to exactly the same
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations and delays as a
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
firearms dealer so
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
there's no special category no special
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
lines no special anything they are
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
subject to exactly the same laws and
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
that's not me that's the congressional
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
research service that compined on that
 
00:30:12.559 --> 00:30:15.430 align:start position:0%
research service that compined on that
legislation

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for your testimony the
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
chair would like to inquire um
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
or ask a question and i want to thank
 
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
you in advance for taking my question
 
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
can you describe uh in your opinion at
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
least what is causing some of these
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
delays because in my opinion
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
like i i never i never experienced it so
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
i i've heard the story what what is
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
causing these delays
 
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh i would suggest that um
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
in one case uh
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
well in numerous cases
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh the large
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
volume of checks that needed to be done
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
uh i think certainly
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
outreach by the department into areas
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
not authorized by statute or rule
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
in checking things um and a a large part
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
of that is the
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
uh again the 170 000 uh records that
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
have not been uh apprecia achieved
 
00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
disposition by the department of justice
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh so again a little house cleaning
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't hurt there
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:31:20.799 --> 00:31:21.830 align:start position:0%
and so
uh

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
volume of sales
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
the overreach by the department beyond
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
its statutory uh authority um and
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
personnel shortage i think uh are are
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.950 align:start position:0%
thank you
representatives

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:39.610 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:43.269 align:start position:0%
for a question
[Music]

00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for taking my question
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering
 
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
how many people will be needed to be
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
hired at the sheriff's department to
 
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
uh my answer to that would be none the
 
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
volume of of of cases that they would
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
deal with i said is is 450 roughly a
 
00:32:15.919 --> 00:32:16.789 align:start position:0%
deal with i said is is 450 roughly a
year

00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh that from the uh justice departments
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
uh uh own the numbers
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
if you if you look at that if you
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
divided it out either on the basis of
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
population or otherwise
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
to do the next check or the research
 
00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
might take an hour it can be done by
 
00:32:38.789 --> 00:32:38.799 align:start position:0%
anyone that's authorized by law to do
 
00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
those checks it could be someone that's
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
required to be deputized it could be a
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
dispatcher at 11 o'clock at night
 
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.509 align:start position:0%
dispatcher at 11 o'clock at night
so

00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
there should be no additional personnel
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
requirements the system is very quick
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
the system is very easy to use it's a
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
direct portal into the next system and
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
uh very simple to operate we will of
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
course pay for the training of the
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
individuals that will operate it
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative recognized for a question
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chair and thank you
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
um could you just elaborate on my
 
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the handguns
 
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
use the uh
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
the fbi nisk is that correct and then we
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
use the gun line for long guns
 
00:33:20.399 --> 00:33:21.190 align:start position:0%
use the gun line for long guns
uh

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
no sir i think that's in reverse the a
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
person that purchases a long gun
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
uh the ffl the dealer directly queries
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
the next system
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
but the state police gun line is only
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
for handguns
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
and uh and that again uh
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
it begs the question
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
if a person wanted to do harm
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
it was not authorized to buy a handgun
 
00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
because of the checks done by the state
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
police they would still be authorized to
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
purchase a long gun
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
and so that begs the question are we
 
00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
really doing anything for the safety of
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
individuals with this if we made it
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
through the fbi directly and submitted
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
all the court orders and so forth there
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%
both long guns and handguns as in many
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
other states
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
would trigger the um
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
the disqualifier
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
and the administrative process much
 
00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.550 align:start position:0%
and the administrative process much
quicker

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
quicker
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
the same information in there much more
 
00:34:16.879 --> 00:34:18.069 align:start position:0%
the same information in there much more
quickly

00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
and again to the benefit of both the
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
consumers and of course the dealers and
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
i think the safety of the people of the
 
00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:28.790 align:start position:0%
i think the safety of the people of the
state

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative recognized for a
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.349 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
so

00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:35.359 --> 00:34:36.869 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
just for further elaboration why don't
 
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
we just use the nist system for both
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what we're trying to do
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
here sir
 
00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:47.669 align:start position:0%
here sir
okay

00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
representative i'll show you recognized
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
for indulging me in another question
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
um i'm you mentioned in your testimony
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
that the state is conducting through the
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
gun line 450
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
to 500 inquiries per year
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
um and so we know that that can't
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
possibly um
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
shake out to the to the counties in with
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
an equal distribution do you have
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
information as to which counties receive
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
more and what the how many what um the
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
inquiries are per county
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
all right look thank you for the
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
question representative um
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
i need to clarify that
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
the domestic the court
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
the court involved
 
00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.910 align:start position:0%
the court involved
um

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
cases are 450 500 a year obviously many
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
more total across the state in terms of
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
purchases of firearms overall
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
and so um it's it's it's as a sure bet
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
that it's not a linear distribution it's
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
not equally against the counties and so
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
um but it's also uh
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
again counties generally have more staff
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
if they're bigger and more population
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh and again the amount of time to
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
conduct these checks within the confines
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
of current statute
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh is very limited it's very minimal
 
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.150 align:start position:0%
uh is very limited it's very minimal
and

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
that would um
 
00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.109 align:start position:0%
that would um
again

00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think it would certainly exceed
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
anything that the state
 
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chair
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
are you recognized for our follow-up
 
00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:36.870 align:start position:0%
are you recognized for our follow-up
question

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you for
 
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.750 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you for
the

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
for taking this follow-up question so
 
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to ask this through the
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
lens of somebody who lives in one of the
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
more populated counties here in the
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
state i live in rockingham county
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
and it would seem that based on
 
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.710 align:start position:0%
and it would seem that based on
population

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:57.829 align:start position:0%
population
um

00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:57.839 --> 00:36:59.190 align:start position:0%
um
that

00:36:59.190 --> 00:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:59.200 --> 00:36:59.990 align:start position:0%
that
if

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
that my county and perhaps
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
merrimack county another very populated
 
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
county would um
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps be processing or be their
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
sheriff's department might have to
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
process a whole lot more
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
of these requ of
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
these checks than say a less populated
 
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.109 align:start position:0%
these checks than say a less populated
county

00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
and so that distribution of funding
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
that's in the bill in part
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
lines 21-26
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
it looks like the distribution is is
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
equal but
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
um there seemed there is there isn't
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
anything in that space and
 
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
would you consider
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
putting into that space
 
00:37:47.599 --> 00:37:48.390 align:start position:0%
putting into that space
a

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
state um
 
00:37:51.359 --> 00:37:53.109 align:start position:0%
state um
commitment

00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
to covering that cost rather than
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
making these
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
counties come back to the state on an
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
annual basis or i'm sorry bi-annual
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
basis for the biennial budget so that
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
those costs don't shift down
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
to the counties because right now it
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
once the training is over if i read this
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
correctly once this training is over
 
00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.589 align:start position:0%
correctly once this training is over
and

00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh setup is done on lines 21 22 and 23
 
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
then all state money seems to go away
 
00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.510 align:start position:0%
then all state money seems to go away
so

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
would there would you be interested in
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
adding in
 
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
a state budget
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
so that counties can
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
meet that demand
 
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
i would certainly entertain that
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative it's an excellent
 
00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:44.950 align:start position:0%
representative it's an excellent
question

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
again that ten thousand per county is is
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
the initial
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
training equipping and so forth and uh
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
the bill does not address beyond that
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to do so
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
i think it'd be important uh to reassure
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh counties um again it may need
 
00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.670 align:start position:0%
uh counties um again it may need
adjustment

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
adjustment
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure we come up with a figure
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
and that was one of the reasons we
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to have that six-month window
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
between getting the funding to set the
 
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
system up and actually switching over to
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
it to try to figure out um exactly what
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
those costs would be and then to bring
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
them in and i'd be happy to entertain
 
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
language to do that i certainly think
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
it's the state's obligation
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
the last follow-up question
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um and thank you for taking uh
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
my last question so uh if i if you turn
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
just so the other members of the
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
committee know where i am i am on page
 
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.230 align:start position:0%
committee know where i am i am on page
five

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal note and there's
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
other than the money that's laid out on
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
page four as
 
00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:49.829 align:start position:0%
page four as
um

00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
startup costs
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
which are equitably distributed through
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
the counties
 
00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
there's um there's nothing in the fiscal
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
note and i'm concerned and
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
one other thing that's uh
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
did you mean to do this
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
um was
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
there's no projection of how how much
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
can how many how much staff
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
would need to
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
be instituted by county to make this
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
work and also support
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
systems throughout those six months or
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
is the support supposed to be in that 10
 
00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.470 align:start position:0%
is the support supposed to be in that 10
grand

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.349 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
i think i know what the question is but
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
let me uh
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
the 10 000 is is basically the cost of
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
setting up the system in each of the
 
00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:43.990 align:start position:0%
setting up the system in each of the
counties

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.109 align:start position:0%
counties
okay

00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
and and that includes
 
00:40:50.829 --> 00:40:50.839 align:start position:0%
computer terminal if necessary
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
um i don't believe the fbi charges for
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
access to the portal it'd be a secure
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
portal and the training required to to
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
as to how to use the next system
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.190 align:start position:0%
and so
um

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
that 10 000 is in the bill
 
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
it does it does in fact if you read at
 
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
the bottom it abolishes the state police
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
gun line
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
again i'm not sure where your what the
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
exact um
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
metrics of your question are
 
00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
but it would save
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh considerable amount of money
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
and uh as well as the the the the
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
the two additional
 
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
staff that we're going to be added in
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
this year's budget at a tune of about
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
180 000
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
so you're going to save close to half a
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
that money
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sure would more than cover the cost
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
to all the sheriff's departments
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh remember given that they're going to
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
be doing the knicks checks
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh and they'll be they'll be researching
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence orders which will
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
now be directed
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
straight into nix and also to the
 
00:42:05.109 --> 00:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
department of safety uh and referencing
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
representative muse's question of course
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
uh that may uh even further streamline
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
the process but i think further
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
testimony subsequent to mine will more
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
more appropriately address those
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.390 align:start position:0%
 
almost

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
almost
 
00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:41.990 align:start position:0%
almost
[Music]

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
to ask
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
questions thank you chairman um thank
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
you senator for taking my question
 
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
so this completely i might understand
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
this basically bypasses the fbi need for
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
us to to use them and we handle
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
no what
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
there is not it is not lawfully possible
 
00:43:06.319 --> 00:43:07.349 align:start position:0%
there is not it is not lawfully possible
to

00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
bypass the fbi
 
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh nyx system
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
for the purchase of any firearm in the
 
00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.750 align:start position:0%
for the purchase of any firearm in the
country

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.829 align:start position:0%
country
um

00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it takes the from
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
the state police gun line
 
00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:21.910 align:start position:0%
the state police gun line
okay

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
the processing of checks into domestic
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
violence and stalking orders
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
gives that to the sheriffs because
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
they're co-located with the courts
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
it then
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
directs the court system
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
to directly input
 
00:43:43.589 --> 00:43:43.599 align:start position:0%
to the fbi uh parenthetically we have
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
checked the fbi is capable and ready to
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
to accept those records any domestic
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
violence or stalking orders into the
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
next system
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
all right so we stop any delays at the
 
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
state police and we we go direct from
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
the court straight into knicks the
 
00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:58.950 align:start position:0%
the court straight into knicks the
sheriff's

00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
sheriff's
 
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
when these court orders regarding
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and and stalking are
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
rescinded or
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
then the sheriff goes into nix looks and
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
sees it's been rescinded because without
 
00:44:09.599 --> 00:44:10.390 align:start position:0%
sees it's been rescinded because without
that

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
that creates the delay uh that's been
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
prevalent in the state police records uh
 
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
through the gun line so
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
um again
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
it actually streamlines the process and
 
00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
requires and provides the next system
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
with the information it needs
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
but that it's not currently getting
 
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
because it's going to the state police
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
represent finance
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair thank you senator um
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
so it's getting a little clearer so
 
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.309 align:start position:0%
so it's getting a little clearer so
um

00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
we want people to be able to protect
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves themselves and i agree with
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
that so this streamlines the process for
 
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
less waiting periods do you have any
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
data on how many incidents there were
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
for people that actually waited before
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
this was enacted as our current law
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
exists is there any incidents that come
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
to mind this is the reason why we need
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
to put this bill forth you have any
 
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
data on that any numbers of what's going
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
on in the state
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
i think subsequent testimony will
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
provide that but i can tell you it's in
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
the hundreds if not the thousands of
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
delays that have been encroached caused
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
over over the last several years i'm
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
sorry to interrupt i don't mean delays i
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
mean victims that have fallen prey
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
because of a delay do you have any
 
00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.550 align:start position:0%
because of a delay do you have any
incidents

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
incidents
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
where there was a crime because of this
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
i can specify i i know of one specific
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
one that was two manchester police
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
officers that were shot not too long ago
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
by a person who escaped if you will the
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
scrutiny of the state police gun line
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
i think subsequent testimony will attest
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
you know two
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
more specific incidents
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
um that have happened uh again of
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
concern uh is the situation where
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
because of the delay
 
00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.710 align:start position:0%
because of the delay
the

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh the individual
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
can can procure a weapon after three
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
days under federal law
 
00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.829 align:start position:0%
days under federal law
and

00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
you know that particular weapon for
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
which they applied for the the uh the
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
knicks check
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
it puts the gun dealers in a terrible
 
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.069 align:start position:0%
it puts the gun dealers in a terrible
position

00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:46:11.119 --> 00:46:13.030 align:start position:0%
and so
again

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
if we take the gun line away we leave
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
the sheriff's there to deal with the
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
domestic violence piece and all firearms
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
purchases go directly to knicks
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
we stop a lot of these delays that were
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
caused with the short stop at this at
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
the gun line before things got down
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
to the fbi before the weapon was
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
chair witness representative o'hara for
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and i may have a
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up but my first question is you
 
00:46:47.109 --> 00:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
stated that
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
the sheriff's department
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
is at the courts and that
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
they would work hand-in-hand
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
together but it is my understanding that
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
the sheriff's departments are only at
 
00:46:59.190 --> 00:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
the superior court level and
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
on the circuit court level
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
the bailiffs are through the other um
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
security system uh through the state so
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
i see
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
a potential problem with that
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
well i don't i would i would offer that
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh if the court puts the records into
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
the nick system
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
electronically immediately upon the
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
issuance within 24 hours of the issuance
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
domestic violence or uh or stalking
 
00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.589 align:start position:0%
domestic violence or uh or stalking
order

00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
that information is available to the
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
sheriff's wherever they're located
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that the geographic
 
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
location together
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh with the courts is is really a factor
 
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
here but the point being that the courts
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
would directly input the stuff into the
 
00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.670 align:start position:0%
would directly input the stuff into the
mix

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
mix
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
and it would be instantly accessible to
 
00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.470 align:start position:0%
and it would be instantly accessible to
any

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
ffl dealer to the sheriff's to anybody
 
00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
that was then to queer the system
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
in the beginning of this uh your
 
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
statement or if i recall you said that
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
you know that the state police don't
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
have the authority and that this is
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
clean it up so that we downshift it to
 
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
the sheriff's but wouldn't have been
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
much easier to just propose something
 
00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.710 align:start position:0%
much easier to just propose something
that

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
corrects the problem
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
on the state level instead of
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
i think for the sake of efficiency
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know the gun line is is going to
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
cause costs already it's half a million
 
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
a year
 
00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:39.750 align:start position:0%
a year
um

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:41.349 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
i i just think that things are handled
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
better locally close to the courts
 
00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.030 align:start position:0%
better locally close to the courts
um

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.470 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
again as to the downshifting
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh the term again we're covering the
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
costs of implementation
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
we have six months to study uh
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
what other costs might be uh in
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
incurred over the operational lifetime
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
and once we get into the using the
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
system at the uh at the sheriff's level
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
and those costs as i've said i'm more
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
than happy to entertain an amendment uh
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
as suggested by representative
 
00:49:19.119 --> 00:49:20.230 align:start position:0%
as suggested by representative
aldshiller

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
aldshiller
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh to address those issues going forward
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get a handle on if those
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
costs would exist and what they would be
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
and that's that's another reason for
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:31.430 align:start position:0%
 
greene

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
greene
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
do you recognize her question yes thank
 
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
refresh thank you senator for taking my
 
00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.069 align:start position:0%
refresh thank you senator for taking my
question

00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:49:38.079 --> 00:49:39.349 align:start position:0%
question
uh

00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
several years back there was a gun
 
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:43.839 align:start position:0%
dealer on 125 in
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
he was a single person in the store
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
three gentlemen came in to purchase a
 
00:49:49.359 --> 00:49:50.790 align:start position:0%
three gentlemen came in to purchase a
handgun

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
handgun
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
they did the background check through
 
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
the same police
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
and the guys were getting very impatient
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
about about 25 30 minutes later
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
three state police showed up three state
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
cruisers showed up
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
and arrested these guys there was a
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
warrant out for them
 
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
and when they were being arrested they
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
threatened the gun dealer
 
00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.589 align:start position:0%
threatened the gun dealer
and

00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
two weeks later the gun dealer opposed
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
the shot and that was it
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
did you believe that
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
by going with the knicks is this gonna
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
i absolutely do
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely do um
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
and i think it would be better uh again
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
for the reason stated would be much
 
00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.150 align:start position:0%
for the reason stated would be much
streamlined

00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
streamlined
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh and if a knicks alert goes out
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
the next alert goes out the state police
 
00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
should be notified um
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
i think uh potentially
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh and and respond as quickly you know i
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for taking my question
 
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative means you recognized for
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking another
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
question from me senator
 
00:50:58.720 --> 00:50:59.829 align:start position:0%
question from me senator
um

00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's baked into the
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
bill is the assumption that the courts
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
can directly input
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
domestic violence protection order
 
00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:08.710 align:start position:0%
domestic violence protection order
information

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding from some bills that we
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
heard testimony on uh uh in the last
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
session uh is that uh the state actually
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
provides and submits protection order
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
information into a different database
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
than nics so
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
it's actually submitted into the
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
national crime information center ncic
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
database uh through spots the state
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
police online telecommunications system
 
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
my question is is if this if the state
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
police are not involved in this process
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh and this is something the courts are
 
00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
going to be doing directly
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
would the courts have access to a system
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
like that and and how would this work
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
the next system checks three things uh
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
and one's triple i i forget the second
 
00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
and the third is ncic that you mentioned
 
00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:59.670 align:start position:0%
and the third is ncic that you mentioned
um

00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
again that's that's more of an
 
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
electronics question
 
00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:03.670 align:start position:0%
electronics question
uh

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
as to which database the court's
 
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
documents go into
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
as long as they're submitted directly
 
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
and timely
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
the next system will check that database
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
i said ncic is one of them that is
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
checked a national crime information
 
00:52:18.319 --> 00:52:19.430 align:start position:0%
checked a national crime information
center

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
center
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
and so i don't think that's a problem i
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
think it's a matter of electronics as to
 
00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:24.790 align:start position:0%
think it's a matter of electronics as to
which

00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
database the information it's currently
 
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
going from the state police there if we
 
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
take the state police out
 
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
we just send it directly there from the
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
court system
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
representative you recognized for a
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
final question
 
00:52:41.119 --> 00:52:42.069 align:start position:0%
final question
um

00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
my follow-up question would be is if
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
that's something that doesn't exist now
 
00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
isn't that the kind of thing that would
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
actually add to the implementation cost
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
of a system like this and and given the
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
level of security that would be
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
necessary for something like that
 
00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be a
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
fairly significant cost i don't think so
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
i think it's a computer terminal
 
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh the the portal into whichever system
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
it is the uh i think might be triple i
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
whichever ncic
 
00:53:09.599 --> 00:53:10.630 align:start position:0%
whichever ncic
um

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
i don't see a cost there that's any of
 
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
any substantial nature
 
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
i said we're already doing it through
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
the state police it's just a matter of
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
switching the recipient
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
instead of sending the information to
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
the state police to send in we send it
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
directly to that very database
 
00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:38.309 --> 00:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee i
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate your consideration of this
 
00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:45.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:47.670 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to limit testimony to three
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
minutes for witness also
 
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
we've been following this
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
throughout the hearings that each member
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
is limited to two questions per per
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
witness i did allow an exception for
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
obviously the
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
senator who introduced the bill and i
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
invited an exception for the question as
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
well but claim forward that we're going
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
well mr chairman should i uh make a
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
point of order
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
you don't have to ask to make a point of
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
order all right one more
 
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
one of what it is thank you mr chairman
 
00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:28.309 align:start position:0%
one of what it is thank you mr chairman
um

00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
you know uh on this particular topic we
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
got two and a half hours
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
to have a debate and i see some hands up
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
you know to speak
 
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
i would just hate to limit three minutes
 
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
when key people chime in
 
00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
because they're gonna have a lot of good
 
00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:46.230 align:start position:0%
because they're gonna have a lot of good
information

00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
and then to limit us just the two
 
00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.710 align:start position:0%
and then to limit us just the two
questions

00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
you know it is discretionary my
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it's the both the
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
restriction on the amount of questions
 
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
and the time limit
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
for witnesses
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh it's within the discretion of the
 
00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:01.990 align:start position:0%
uh it's within the discretion of the
chair

00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:02.790 align:start position:0%
chair
uh

00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
for the people who've been following
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
along often see that
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
i would be allowed 10 seconds 15 seconds
 
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
leeway with that
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
and it's at the discretion chair at one
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
point with anything that witnessed one
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
minute and i did allow it to go on for
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
seven minutes given the
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
the weight is
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
subject matter for testimonials that was
 
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
in a different hearing

00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
it is within the scratching the chair so
 
00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:32.839 align:start position:0%
i'm not i understand your point of order
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:38.800 align:start position:0%

if we have additional time
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
take that consideration as well
 
00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:00.690 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:08.630 align:start position:0%

00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
that there's a new fiscal note for the
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%

line um as you've heard in uh prior
 
00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
testimony we have been addressing
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
a rather large increase
 
00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:15.910 align:start position:0%
a rather large increase
in

00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:15.920 align:start position:0%

00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
i also wanted to say we have partnered
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
with the courts and i believe um
 
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
attorney richard head is also on the

line our permits and licensing unit have
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
worked closely with the courts um as you
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know heard prior testimony we've um
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
heard um about protective orders and
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
domestic violence orders
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
some orders that are can be entered into
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
ncic some orders that cannot
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
you've heard about different systems
 
00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:49.829 align:start position:0%
you've heard about different systems
here

00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
federal systems state systems databases
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
where this is such an important issue
 
00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
and a rather complicated issue
 
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
we provided and i know the courts
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
provided a fact sheet
 
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to ask the chair um
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
does the to sir do you and the members
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
of the committee have you received what
 
00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:09.270 align:start position:0%
of the committee have you received what
was

00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
the work that was done by the courts and
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
representative abbas i just wanted to
 
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
we do have members participating
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
remotely have have the materials his
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
email to us yesterday
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and i don't i don't want
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
to speak for attorney head i know he's
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
he's um he's also present on the call um
 
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
i just um what i wanted to do was ensure
 
00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.390 align:start position:0%
i just um what i wanted to do was ensure
that

00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
and i think that this work product
 
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
clearly outlays out the background
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
the differences between
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
the search that's conducted by the fbi
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
and the permits and licensing unit
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
also addresses the return of the
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
firearms which has been discussed
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
earlier and the process and the
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
difference in the process
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
and what we have done to
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
streamline or improve the efficiency
 
00:59:33.839 --> 00:59:34.549 align:start position:0%
streamline or improve the efficiency
and

00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
that is we've redefined the scope of the
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
checks and we've aligned it more but i
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
think it's important to understand um
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
the difference between
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
the databases so that everybody is clear
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
what is nix what is ncic what is
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
contained in the nix index and what does
 
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
the permits and licensing unit do and
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
currently the permits and licensing unit
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
also includes the licensure of security
 
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
guards uh explosives and private
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
investigators so this permits and
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
licensing unit where the gun line duties
 
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
exist have other collateral duties but
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
i would uh i again i don't want to go
 
01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
through this line by line but i think
 
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
it's important for the committee to make
 
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
01:00:23.349 --> 01:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
everybody understands clearly what the
 
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
differences is and how some of these
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
protective orders may be
 
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
entered into ncic or may not
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
and those that are not rest solely in
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
the permits and licensing unit for
 
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
aquarium cross-check
 
01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.270 align:start position:0%
aquarium cross-check
so

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh i would uh again for for for time i
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
would like to uh again i've got
 
01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
lieutenant mcquaid here and i would like
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
the courts to be able to speak more
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
specifically to their process and how
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
the protective orders travel from you
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
know uh
 
01:00:59.589 --> 01:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
from from a victim to the courts you
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
know what gets entered into ncic and and
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
and what doesn't and again just as a
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
little history which is contained in it
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
we've been conducting handling this at
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
the department of safety since uh 1993.
 
01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:14.230 align:start position:0%
the department of safety since uh 1993.

oh absolutely so he is correct there
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
were delays and i think that we had over
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
a 60 percent increase in gun sales
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
that coupled with um during copen we had
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
some employees that were out
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
impacted by covet so you had us over 60
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
approximately 65 percent increase in
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
volume but more importantly
 
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
we had a process
 
01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
the statute doesn't define exactly what
 
01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
the check is that is done by the permits
 
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
and licensing unit so we work closely
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general's office and
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
we redefined the scope what is the check
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
that the permits and licensing unit will
 
01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.270 align:start position:0%
that the permits and licensing unit will
do

01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
and we were
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
we redefined it and we brought it back
 
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
so we believe it is in the best interest
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
of of public safety and it was um
 
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
you know looking further into our own
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
criminal records repository to ensure
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
that there were not disqualifiers that
 
01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
had not get uploaded into the nix index
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
but balancing the right of somebody to
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
purchase a firearm and some of these
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
delays were you know
 
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
were unacceptable so i think what we did
 
01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.109 align:start position:0%
were unacceptable so i think what we did
is

01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
we redefined the scope of the check
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
which i i think was very important we
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
looked at our
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
our phone system which we've readdressed
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
in in the past several months
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
we've looked at you know the technology
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
potential for improvements on some of
 
01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
these databases but i think the key is
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
we have been able to keep these backlogs
 
01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.109 align:start position:0%
we have been able to keep these backlogs
down

01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
um i think they are in a good position
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
right now we address the backlogs in the
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
court so to answer your question sir it
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
was a 60 over 60 60 65 percent increase
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
in call volume was essentially a perfect
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
stop and we dealt with some uh vacancies
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
due to covert but
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
and also again the scope of the check
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
it was in my opinion too expansive we
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
redefined it we're looking at our own
 
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
state records
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
we're looking we're querying against the
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
list that we get from the aoc daily on
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
any protective order where the victim
 
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
does not have a date of birth we query
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
that look at our own state and then
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
align with the fbi the other issue is we
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
had many cases that were in delay status
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it can go into delay
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
because of this an example is somebody
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
wants to purchase a firearm the permits
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
and licensing unit
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
clerk looks at the record the record on
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
its face
 
01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
is incomplete there isn't enough
 
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
information in there to determine is
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
there is that a disqualifier is that a
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
disqualifier what actually happened in
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
the court what was the final
 
01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:04.950 align:start position:0%
the court what was the final
adjudication

01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
adjudication
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
what is the potential sentence so they
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
have to reach outside of the state they
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
maybe have to look towards another state
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
and quite honestly it just we you know
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
many states just aren't responsive in
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
time and we're supposed to have these uh
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
if it's in delayed get it to deny to
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
approve within three business days so
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
what we did we had many that were far
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
beyond the fbi uh limit of i believe
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's 88 days
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
and so what we did was we brought ours
 
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
back after 88 days
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
if um if we can't get an answer then we
 
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
take it out of that delayed status so so
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
to address
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
we've looked at our process
 
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
we looked at our personnel we looked at
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
cross training we've looked at our phone
 
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
system and we redefine the scope
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
of our stop
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
of our background check to ensure that
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
we balance
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
we're balancing the right to purchase a
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
firearm with doing a safe as safe as
 
01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable background check
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
understanding we could not
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
call all 50 states to ensure that there
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
is not a
 
01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.950 align:start position:0%
is not a
disposition

01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
disposition
 
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
or a conviction that hasn't been
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
uploaded and just to be clear for
 
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
everybody this is very complicated but
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
in the triple i database what we refer
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
to as the fbi check if there is a
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
conviction in any state where the
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
defendant was not fingerprinted that
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
would not be in that database
 
01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
so um so i hope that answered that
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
thank you commission thank you again for
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
uh the chair recognizes representative
 
01:06:49.349 --> 01:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
yes thank you commissioner for taking my
 
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
my question is around
 
01:06:55.599 --> 01:06:56.589 align:start position:0%
my question is around
any

01:06:56.589 --> 01:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies that you might see as
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
you look at the bill and as you read it
 
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
and the way that you understand that the
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
process not only is working now
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
but would have to work um if it's
 
01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
changed the way that it's specified in
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
this bill so do you see things that
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
based on your knowledge of uh the way
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
the system works the way the fbi works
 
01:07:19.039 --> 01:07:19.910 align:start position:0%
the system works the way the fbi works
um

01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
that could be problematic
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
well i mean
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
i mean the in simplest terms is this if
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
you purchase a lawn gun today in new
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire it goes to the fbi
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
and they run it through their next check
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
that you know we are i believe one of
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
three states if you purchase a handgun
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
um if you were to send it to the fbi
 
01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
to keep it as simple as possible if you
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
look at our fact check here there are a
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
couple of there are several
 
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
steps that would not be checked that
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
would be missed
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
and and i think that that is something
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
that that is just you know that that
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
that is accurate we're doing
 
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
above and beyond
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
some steps that that they would do and
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
i go back to that list of i believe it's
 
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
roughly 50 to 70 that
 
01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:12.799 align:start position:0%
file a protective order for whatever
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
reason and we get that emailed so
 
01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:16.950 align:start position:0%
reason and we get that emailed so
we

01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
cross check against that prior to
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
approving on a
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
on any purchase so i would say uh
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
to the return of firearms
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
we do the return of firearms with these
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
that have been taken through the courts
 
01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.470 align:start position:0%
that have been taken through the courts
and

01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes the local police departments
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
if they seize a weapon whether it's from
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
a you know a a a burglary or whatever
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
reason they can they can run that next
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
check as well to see if the weapon can
 
01:08:49.839 --> 01:08:50.550 align:start position:0%
check as well to see if the weapon can
be

01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
be returned but again when we do that
 
01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:54.550 align:start position:0%
be returned but again when we do that
process

01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
through the courts we also query against
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
the list that we're getting that's
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
unsupported by a date of birth so i
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
would say representative muse we do uh
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
we do we do have we have done and we do
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
more than the fbi we were doing several
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
additional steps but as i said as our
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
policy we redefined it we brought it in
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
because it was just not sustainable and
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
so we had to balance it so
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
and again that's contained in this
 
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
in this uh in this document in more
 
01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.229 align:start position:0%
in this uh in this document in more
detail

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
detail
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the other gentleman
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
that's with you
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
i would like to know are you in favor of
 
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
this bill or opposed to this bill
 
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
we're remaining neutral representative
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
welch what i mean by that i believe this
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
is a policy decision and what i've said
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
is this if the gun line
 
01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
or if the gun line
 
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
is to stay within the department of
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
safety and the permits and licensing
 
01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
unit we will do the best we can to
 
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
ensure customer service is met public
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
safety and we do the best job we can if
 
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
the decision is made to send this to the
 
01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
um to the fbi then i believe that's um
 
01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:23.910 align:start position:0%
um to the fbi then i believe that's um
that's

01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know rests in your hands so we're
 
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
remaining neutral on it
 
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative you recognize for a
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up question thank you mr chairman
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh commissioner

01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
i cannot remain neutral i have to take a
 
01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:45.520 align:start position:0%

01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%

01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
and affordable
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
order mr chairman this witness is not an
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
elected official to vote and give a
 
01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.470 align:start position:0%
elected official to vote and give a
decision

01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
to representative marston which he was
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
let's vote on fine night i believe i've
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
the representative asked
 
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
a question of the witness whether they
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
oppose a bill or they support a bill the
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
witness has the right to answer the
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
question saying that they are mutual
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
but that being said
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh if you it's quite often that when any
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
witness testifies before
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
i believe this is actually the policy of
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
every committee that the witness states
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
their position whether it's in support
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
opposition or neutral so your point of
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
order was recognized
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
and that's the ruling of the chair so
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
the question is appropriate
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
i also believe that that question was
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
asked and answered already but if the
 
01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
commission wishes to clarify he met
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.709 --> 01:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
representative newman you recognize for
 
01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
thank you was that for me mr chair
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
you were a little garbled you were the
 
01:12:16.630 --> 01:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
only representative on the committee you
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
were recognized
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
and thank you commissioner for taking my
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
question yes sir this is this is a
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
complicated issue and there seems to be
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
that the gun line
 
01:12:32.229 --> 01:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
um did a lot of
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
extra things to check the extra
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
databases that we have information on
 
01:12:37.199 --> 01:12:38.149 align:start position:0%
databases that we have information on
and

01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
in your reading of this bill do you see
 
01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:41.430 align:start position:0%
in your reading of this bill do you see
that

01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
type of ability to do that kind of thing
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
when it's transmitted to the counties
 
01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:50.709 align:start position:0%
when it's transmitted to the counties
that

01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
your the experience the gun line has had
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
with that kind of stuff will go will be
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
adequately trained to the people at the
 
01:12:57.199 --> 01:12:58.550 align:start position:0%
adequately trained to the people at the
uh

01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh county level
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
well i i think here's a here's a point
 
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
of clarification
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
the county level
 
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
will not be making these decisions this
 
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
will go to the fbi nix
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
they will make the decision and those
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative also you're recognized
 
01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner quinn
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
you mentioned in your testimony that new
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire has seen a 60
 
01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.070 align:start position:0%
hampshire has seen a 60
increase

01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
in gun sales is that in this past
 
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
calendar year or what was the um
 
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
time frame that you're referencing there
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
so we did ma'am and again just
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
give or take uh several i believe it was
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
57 000 in 2019
 
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
87 000 in 2012
 
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
and we are currently in the area of 30
 
01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:04.790 align:start position:0%
and we are currently in the area of 30
000

01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
000
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
with four months so we we
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
we estimate an increase um in 21 from
 
01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.430 align:start position:0%
we estimate an increase um in 21 from
20.

01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
20.
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
so that was from 19 to 20 which was the
 
01:14:16.149 --> 01:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
over 60 percent you know approximately
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
60 63 65 percent increase
 
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
those are the years
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
man follow up mr chair
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a follow-up
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you commissioner
 
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate an answer in either
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
the 2021 range or the 2020 range
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
whatever information you have
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
but if the concern
 
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
for this bill seems to be that
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
people are not able to access a purchase
 
01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
of a firearm and so my question is
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh with this increase in sales how many
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
of these people are first-time gun
 
01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.630 align:start position:0%
of these people are first-time gun
owners

01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
we don't in in and by statute we're not
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
allowed to retain that information
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's and it's 63 which is these numbers
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
are on page six six of the uh which the
 
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:31.830 --> 01:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
okay that i don't i don't have that
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
document that was not sent to me
 
01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
um so did you i'm sorry 63 increase not
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
60. did i hear you wrong six yes with
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
over eight yeah so
 
01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.270 align:start position:0%
over eight yeah so
so

01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
both in 19 and 20 the gun line realized
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
significant increases in the number of
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
queries that were received from the over
 
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
400 ffls
 
01:15:57.750 --> 01:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the state with over 86 000
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
checks being processed in 2020 which
 
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
represented a 63 increase
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
we are limiting questions to two to two
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
yes uh commissioner
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
would you agree that the gun line
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
has experienced problems and have those
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
would yes i would i would agree that the
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
gun line had
 
01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
had significant delays
 
01:16:41.199 --> 01:16:42.070 align:start position:0%
had significant delays
and

01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
we have addressed them
 
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
and i believe today
 
01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
we are in a
 
01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
better position stable
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the metrics
 
01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.669 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the metrics
times

01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:16:58.229 --> 01:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
frequency of calls
 
01:16:58.239 --> 01:17:00.390 align:start position:0%
frequency of calls
staffing

01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
staffing
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
call taking and scope of the checks so
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
and i would give give the credit to
 
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
lieutenant mcquaid and his team and
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
again we've partnered very closely with
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
the courts
 
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we're
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh there's synergy there between us and
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
the receipt of information that we need
 
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
to make these decisions so yes i i will
 
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely there there were delays but
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
again i go back to
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
we had a 63 percent increase in volume
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
and we're also dealt internally with
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
you know some issues uh due to covert
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
but it's in a much
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
more stable position today and i think
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:52.550 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry sir could you repeat that
 
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
what is your plan for the immediate
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
future for improving the government sure
 
01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question well in this
 
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
budget we have requested three
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
additional positions
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
um the plan is to get these troopers you
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
know back to what
 
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
they uh their jobs which you know we
 
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
understand that recognize that and
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
looking at potential technology
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
options the phone system
 
01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.110 align:start position:0%
options the phone system
um

01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
the aligning more with the fbi i mean
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
quite honestly the scope of our search
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
was too expansive and that really um
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
i would say increased our our delays so
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
i think that was probably
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
the most significant
 
01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.950 align:start position:0%
the most significant
um

01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
significant step to address the gun line
 
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
that hadn't been taken in years and i
 
01:18:47.669 --> 01:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
credit the attorney general at the time
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
for working
 
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
on that with us so i think we have a
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
good check
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
in place we're looking at you know we
 
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
know when the shows are we know the
 
01:18:58.630 --> 01:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
busier time the peak times you know
 
01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
we're tracking that the metrics and i
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
think the call you know the call system
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
being able to put you know taking 400
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
calls and getting them in a queue as
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
opposed to you know five so
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
you know we've really looked close at
 
01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
the customer service
 
01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
um and and um
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
you know and and
 
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
process improvement and it's continuous
 
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
process improvement sir so
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
i hope i answered that
 
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative night you were recognized
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question
 
01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
um my question is even with any kind of
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
delay in processing paperwork doesn't
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
page two lines eight through ten ensure
 
01:19:46.239 --> 01:19:47.350 align:start position:0%
page two lines eight through ten ensure
anyone

01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
in any county can buy a gun without
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
any sort of background check and um
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
i have a follow-up after that if you can
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
oh oh
 
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
i don't have the bill and so are you
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
talking about the could you just be a
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
little more specific with what those
 
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
lines are because i i don't have that on
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
my screen i'm i'm looking at our facts
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:21.510 align:start position:0%
 
all ten

01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
and if i can just have a minute i'm
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
trying to get that
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
yeah no problem take your time and while
 
01:20:36.090 --> 01:20:36.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:42.229 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
you may be recognized for a follow-up
 
01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:47.189 align:start position:0%
you may be recognized for a follow-up
question

01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
if we can if i can just get that if we
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
can go to another question and i'll i'll
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
try and get that ma'am if it works and
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
we'll come back to that one
 
01:20:58.470 --> 01:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so much my other question is
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
if that's the case um how will this
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
relate to the active white supremacist
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
those out of order
 
01:21:22.709 --> 01:21:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
there's a foundation to such questions
 
01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
there's no restriction on firearm
 
01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
purchases based on race at all
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
anywhere in this country that i am aware
 
01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:32.149 align:start position:0%
anywhere in this country that i am aware
of

01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
that pressure's out of order in the
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
commission you don't need please you do
 
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
not have to respond to that question
 
01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
thank you sir representative
 
01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
you were recognized for a question thank
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman thank you commissioner
 
01:21:45.199 --> 01:21:46.630 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman thank you commissioner
um

01:21:46.630 --> 01:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
several questions ago you said
 
01:21:51.669 --> 01:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
and i hope i quote you correctly
 
01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
nix won't do the background checks as
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
the lot
 
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
so here's the question you know if you
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
said this this is what i heard
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
the law is very clear so who is
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
following the law is it nix or is it the
 
01:22:11.669 --> 01:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state police on background
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
checks because only one can do it if
 
01:22:16.629 --> 01:22:16.639 align:start position:0%
you're saying that nix won't do the
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.189 align:start position:0%
background checks
as

01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
as you guys do
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
well yeah just no just to clarify it we
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
do additional checks but we also do
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
the nics check
 
01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.430 align:start position:0%
the nics check
so

01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
in our document that we're presented
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
what we will do is what we will do that
 
01:22:40.229 --> 01:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
the fbi does not do is look further into
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
a conviction say a record in new
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire to determine if it's a
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
potential disqualifier for example if a
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
simple assault had a domestic violence
 
01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.870 align:start position:0%
simple assault had a domestic violence
disqualifying

01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
disqualifying
 
01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:56.550 align:start position:0%
disqualifying
um

01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
you know factor in it we we do more
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
representative byrd is what i'm saying
 
01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
but we also run the knicks yeah the next
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
check so we do that as well
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
and when you say the when you say the
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
law the law says we may be the point of
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
contact and that's why we worked
 
01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.550 align:start position:0%
contact and that's why we worked
internally

01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
internally
 
01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up question thank you and
 
01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the uh answer you just
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
gave me
 
01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:27.669 align:start position:0%
gave me
um

01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
also you said which i had the numbers
 
01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:31.189 align:start position:0%
also you said which i had the numbers
approximately

01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
purchases of handguns 87 000 to 2020
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:48.870 --> 01:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
this is what i'm being told so there is
 
01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
a question at the end here
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
i went to a lot of gun stores and
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
they're telling me that
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
today they can get a background done
 
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
approximately five to ten minutes
 
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
if you answer the phone but where the
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
problem is is that
 
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire state police
 
01:24:09.669 --> 01:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
is not answering the phone to one to
 
01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
three hours
 
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
then they you know they can get in the
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
gun store can get in to answer that to
 
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
answer the uh to do the next
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
so what happens if
 
01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
the sales jumps to over a hundred
 
01:24:22.709 --> 01:24:22.719 align:start position:0%
thousand how are you going to handle
 
01:24:22.719 --> 01:24:25.910 align:start position:0%
thousand how are you going to handle
this

01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
so that's so so
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
you act you actually asked two questions
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
so one is
 
01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:34.709 align:start position:0%
so one is
um

01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
why is it
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
why is it that at times
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
you can have
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
a permits and licensing
 
01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:46.719 align:start position:0%
employee answer the phone and give you
 
01:24:46.719 --> 01:24:48.070 align:start position:0%
employee answer the phone and give you
um

01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
customer service instant approval let's
 
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
just say there's no record
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
and why at times and busier times does
 
01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
it take time well it's it's you know the
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
answer is if we've got you know 100
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
um requests from ffl's in a matter of 10
 
01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
minutes obviously there's going to be a
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
delay it's just you know it would be
 
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
impossible to have 100 you know
 
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
employees answering the phone
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
so what we've done is looking at um
 
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
getting the instant you know customer
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
service and at least you know having a a
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
system so that we can and i think the
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
that ffl's understand that sir to be
 
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
honest with you i think they understand
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
that it can't always be instant i was
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
asked the question what does that mean
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
instant well nothing's instant you've
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
gotta but the process that we are doing
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
now is we're taking the calls as they
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
come and trying to give us best service
 
01:25:43.199 --> 01:25:45.510 align:start position:0%
come and trying to give us best service
so

01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
the average wait time is about 14
 
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
and again you know it differs at uh you
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
know on our peak peak times
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:02.709 --> 01:26:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
you may ask one one follow-up question
 
01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:08.709 align:start position:0%
you may ask one one follow-up question
um

01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
i am not hearing this complaint
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
on loan guns because it goes to nics
 
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
and they have the staff to handle 100 or
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
a thousand calls in an hour
 
01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
so you know how are we going to fix this
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire so that way people are
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
not waiting hours
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
sure so
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
yeah no no no that's a good question and
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
i think i mean you have to really look
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
at where we were
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
where we were
 
01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:40.709 align:start position:0%
where we were
in

01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:26:40.719 --> 01:26:41.830 align:start position:0%
in
april

01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
april
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
of last year and where we are today yeah
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
we were in a hole
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
you know there's no denying that but we
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
have made
 
01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
significant improvements here like i've
 
01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
spoken to and we continue to build on
 
01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:54.149 align:start position:0%
spoken to and we continue to build on
that

01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
you know we've got a very scalable
 
01:26:58.390 --> 01:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
flexible model down there just in the
 
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
last two months we've addressed some
 
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
phone uh
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
system delays but again you know as i i
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
hope you would understand a 63
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
increase in volume at a time where
 
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with uh um you know
 
01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
employees that could be impacted or out
 
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
with covert and once you start getting
 
01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
that those delays it it it just
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
continues to add
 
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
and the other issue as i stated is we
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
are sometimes
 
01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
you know a victim of other states not
 
01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
being responsive you know when we have
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
to reach out to get some data so
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
when we address that 88 days delayed but
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
we have really cleaned up the backlogs
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
with the courts and the return of
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
firearms we've got the customer service
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
i would say in a much much better place
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
and if we go from you know uh 87 000
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
we've already addressed that as we
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
looked for these new positions in the
 
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
budget um and and
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
and i think with those positions and
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
potential technology um options out
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
there we we get this the majority of
 
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
folks are approved
 
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
okay we have a very small
 
01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
number that go into delayed um they go
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
into delayed for the right reasons the
 
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
clerks are looking and they're seeing
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
something that causes it to be delayed
 
01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
getting it from delayed to approved to
 
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
denied we've really uh
 
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
i would say um
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
upped our game there and and it's and
 
01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's this and it was the policy quite
 
01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
honestly that allowed us to to look and
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
and define the scope
 
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
and and balance the risk
 
01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
because again calling 50 states
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
individually to check and see if you
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
know uh this individual has something in
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
your state that could be a disqualifier
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
that isn't in the in the fbi system the
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
triple i database
 
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
is is just not uh it's not reasonable
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
it's not practical so
 
01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
it's employees it's technology it's
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
looking at our phone system
 
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
and again the other thing is this uh
 
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative burke it's it's engaging
 
01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
our customers more
 
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's talking to these ffl's and dealing
 
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
with them some are small some are busy
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
at certain times you know working better
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
with them to ensure that we're giving
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
them the service they need but i i would
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
agree with you you know the the the long
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
gun check is different but again back to
 
01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
the question that's been asked several
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
times our check um goes above and beyond
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
that in several areas which are you know
 
01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
contained in the in the sheet that i've
 
01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:33.830 align:start position:0%
contained in the in the sheet that i've
included

01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
i i hope that helps sir yes thank you
 
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
representing me is your recommend for a
 
01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:43.910 align:start position:0%
representing me is your recommend for a
question

01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for
 
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh for taking my question i i i did have
 
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
time to review the uh the sheet that you
 
01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:50.950 align:start position:0%
time to review the uh the sheet that you
sent

01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
sent
 
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that i noted that
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
you note is that there are several
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
protections that are not included
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
in sb 141
 
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
that look like they would be fairly
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
significant and important protections um
 
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
without me telling taking the time to
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
tell you what they are
 
01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:10.470 align:start position:0%
tell you what they are
um

01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
could you just review
 
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
how important you think those
 
01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
protections are
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
sure sure representative news i'm going
 
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
to i know that uh the courts have joined
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
with us and they um are going to also
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
offer but you know
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know i'll just look at you know the
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
protective orders of somebody you know
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
and i've i've been asked the question
 
01:30:32.159 --> 01:30:32.870 align:start position:0%
and i've i've been asked the question
hey

01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
hey
 
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
why why don't these you know victims
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
have a date of birth
 
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
so that the courts can
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
put it into ncic
 
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
they actually don't put into ncic which
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
will be caught on a next check and and
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
the answer is sometimes these are
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm not speaking to any particular
 
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
case but maybe just the uh the victim
 
01:30:58.550 --> 01:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
just doesn't know the offender um
 
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
by date of birth but wants to file the
 
01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
protective order and
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
those would be missed
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
so i i think that's important and um and
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
the fact is and i talked to the fbi the
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
head of the the sieges and i asked would
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
this list could this list that we get
 
01:31:19.990 --> 01:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
daily from the courts be entered into
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
ncic and without a date of birth the
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
answer i received was no so um and again
 
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
they've included the um
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
child protective act
 
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
protection act protective orders but
 
01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
i'll i'm going to defer to um to the
 
01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
courts to to speak in a little more
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
detail on that but i i think they're
 
01:31:39.199 --> 01:31:40.629 align:start position:0%
detail on that but i i think they're
important

01:31:40.629 --> 01:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
representatives are recognized for a
 
01:31:44.239 --> 01:31:46.310 align:start position:0%
representatives are recognized for a
question

01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh commissioner
 
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh it seemed as though with this bill
 
01:31:57.669 --> 01:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
when they addressed it they said all you
 
01:31:59.189 --> 01:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
have to do is
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
put it in the computer
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
and listening to you i find that there's
 
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
many other avenues that you have to go
 
01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
am i correct
 
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
the that we are doing the next check
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
the fbi does the straight next check on
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
a long gun so if you're comparing a long
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
gun purchase today to a handgun as i've
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
said stated we are doing um
 
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
some additional steps we're looking
 
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
closer at our own database to ensure
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
that that something on this record is
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
not a disqualifier and we are also
 
01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:39.110 align:start position:0%
not a disqualifier and we are also
querying

01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
querying
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
a list that we received from the
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the courts
 
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
to ensure that somebody um
 
01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
isn't uh under uh
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
a protective order or bail conditions
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
that would uh prohibit them from
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
purchasing a firearm so we are doing the
 
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
next check it's clear i mean and there's
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
some folks that you know that understand
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
this and have been dealing in this world
 
01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
but it it it to keep it in the most
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
simplest simpler terms is we are doing
 
01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.669 align:start position:0%
simplest simpler terms is we are doing
additional

01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
checks but not as expansive in the past
 
01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:12.470 align:start position:0%
checks but not as expansive in the past
which

01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
was um i would say caused you know
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
increased delays so we're balanced it
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
in some of those cases
 
01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:20.830 align:start position:0%
in some of those cases
thank

01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:33:23.669 --> 01:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
you you're recognized for a question
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question i'm
 
01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
just trying to clarify something you
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
just said
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh you just said that if
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
somebody gets a restraining order they
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
may not have the birthday
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
so would that
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
imply that if bob smith
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
had a restraining order out on them but
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
they didn't know what the birth date was
 
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
that everybody in the state named bob
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
smith can't buy a firearm how do you
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
how do you remedy that
 
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:56.870 align:start position:0%
how do you remedy that
so

01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:59.430 --> 01:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
the answer to that is we have a
 
01:34:01.110 --> 01:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
lieutenant that's in charge of the
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
permits and licensing unit and um that's
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
a very good question how do they ensure
 
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
that the person is not the person and
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
they can do further checks and and and
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
inquiries to to make sure they're not um
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
denying the wrong person so it's with
 
01:34:20.310 --> 01:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
with further checks the other thing that
 
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
hasn't come up either is
 
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes it goes the other way that
 
01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
white that what might look like a
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
disqualifier is actually not with
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative representative testimony
 
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:40.400 align:start position:0%

01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
these other background checks
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
that you do
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh i guess the domestic violence ones
 
01:34:53.669 --> 01:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
are in there
 
01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
do you keep a record and would it be
 
01:34:58.390 --> 01:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
disqualifying the person who was
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
consuming medical marijuana
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
i did i'm sorry i didn't hear that
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
do your background checks include
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not somebody is
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%

we run it through next what is that
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
process sure no that that that's a
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a great question so if
 
01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
you look on um
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
um page two uh i don't know who has it
 
01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
or who doesn't but the next system
 
01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:55.750 align:start position:0%
or who doesn't but the next system
searches

01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
searches
 
01:35:59.189 --> 01:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
so this search will query against triple
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
i which is the interstate identification
 
01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:03.990 align:start position:0%
i which is the interstate identification
index

01:36:03.990 --> 01:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
index
 
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
commonly that you'll hear it in in the
 
01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
police terms is triple i which contains
 
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
criminal history
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
records if a fingerprint was obtained
 
01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
then you've got in the next index
 
01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:16.790 align:start position:0%
then you've got in the next index
the

01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
ncic or the national crime information
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
center which contains records regarding
 
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
wanted persons protection orders
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
deported felons and other matters and
 
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
then we talk about the knicks index
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
the index contains
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
records regarding all violation
 
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and felony convictions
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
regardless of fingerprint support which
 
01:36:43.110 --> 01:36:43.120 align:start position:0%
you disqualify as for federal and state
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
firearms convictions what i talk about
 
01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:47.590 align:start position:0%
firearms convictions what i talk about
when

01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:36:50.790 --> 01:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
i say that our our unit
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
checks further into our own database our
 
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
own state criminal records
 
01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:56.870 align:start position:0%
own state criminal records
we

01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
know that not all of our convictions
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
have been uploaded
 
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
into nics
 
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
so we want to make sure that there
 
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
aren't convictions in our own state
 
01:37:10.149 --> 01:37:10.159 align:start position:0%
we want to get new hampshire
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
you know where it needs to be before we
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
make the approval so we're looking
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
better at our own convictions but we
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
can't look at 49 other states so
 
01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
we've got
 
01:37:21.109 --> 01:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
the nix
 
01:37:21.119 --> 01:37:22.390 align:start position:0%
the nix
system

01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
searches that's the best way to explain
 
01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:25.270 align:start position:0%
searches that's the best way to explain
it

01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
but there is a nics index
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
so within that check that the fbi does
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
they query against those
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
um systems that i just explained
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
and again it's hard to but if you if you
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
refer back to page two of our handout
 
01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
you can you can see it in better detail
 
01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:59.910 align:start position:0%
you can you can see it in better detail
sir

01:37:59.910 --> 01:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know who got all my information
 
01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
i think i filled out a long application
 
01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:08.870 align:start position:0%
i think i filled out a long application
so

01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
do they take my application and fax it
 
01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
to somebody and
 
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
did they introduced by name and social
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
security number or they look in
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
my mother's maiden name they're putting
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
all sorts of information about me into
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
the check or is it basically just like
 
01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
my name or social security number maybe
 
01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:30.470 align:start position:0%
my name or social security number maybe
uh

01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
senior for the hands raised i want to
 
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:59.669 --> 01:38:59.679 align:start position:0%
china recognizes uh
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
just a reminder the testimony will be
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
you can hear me
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
yes we can
 
01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:30.390 align:start position:0%
yes we can
okay

01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chairman
 
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
um i think what you just heard from the
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner using a lot of words is
 
01:39:43.109 --> 01:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
the gun line is no longer broke
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
the problems that you're going to hear
 
01:39:47.109 --> 01:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
from other people and the stories that
 
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear are old stories the
 
01:39:53.109 --> 01:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
problems have been virtually fixed
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
there's always room for improvement um
 
01:39:57.590 --> 01:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
but they've been virtually fixed
 
01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:58.550 align:start position:0%
but they've been virtually fixed
um

01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
starting back in december uh the
 
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
attorney general mcdonald was engaged in
 
01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
writing a policy
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
because it is true that the gun line
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
needed more direction to know what
 
01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
checks to do and what checks not to do
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
so these other state checks have been
 
01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
eliminated um and that has reduced um
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
the time that it takes to process
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
the instant check
 
01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:26.149 align:start position:0%
the instant check
process

01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
by far
 
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
the department has also added personnel
 
01:40:32.629 --> 01:40:32.639 align:start position:0%
in the backlogs that we had in the
 
01:40:35.590 --> 01:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
return of firearms getting firearms back
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
to innocent people in domestic violence
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
cases is virtually um on time now the
 
01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
backlog is gone
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
we had many cases that were backlogged
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
well over 88 days
 
01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
in and nick's policy is if you can't
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
clear it in 88 days you clear the deck
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
that is now our policy at the state
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
level there are no delays beyond 88 days
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire now
 
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
also in this policy um given and the
 
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
directives to the gun line is that 90
 
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
of all inquiries will be answered
 
01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:16.390 align:start position:0%
of all inquiries will be answered
immediately

01:41:16.390 --> 01:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
and that is now the case in fact
 
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
less than three percent
 
01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
of case of inquiries now are delayed
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
less than three percent
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
we've changed the way we've handled the
 
01:41:32.310 --> 01:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
inquiries every inquiry used to come in
 
01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
and be put in a box and another person
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
would have to pick up that inquiry do
 
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
the check
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
put in another box in the and the a
 
01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
third person would call the dealer back
 
01:41:46.229 --> 01:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
that is gone that system is gone you nee
 
01:41:48.390 --> 01:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
when you get the phone answered by your
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
gun line personnel you get your answer
 
01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:53.109 align:start position:0%
gun line personnel you get your answer
97

01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
97
 
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
of the time
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
but that left us with one other problem
 
01:41:58.629 --> 01:41:58.639 align:start position:0%
which was
 
01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
um we can't keep up with the incoming
 
01:42:03.270 --> 01:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
phone calls because of the increase in
 
01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:04.310 align:start position:0%
phone calls because of the increase in
volume

01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
volume
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
many saturdays 400 handguns are sold
 
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of checks
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
so we had to make some mechanical
 
01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
changes to how we handle the calls and
 
01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:18.149 align:start position:0%
changes to how we handle the calls and
now

01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:18.159 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
just recently in the last couple of
 
01:42:22.629 --> 01:42:22.639 align:start position:0%
weeks we have a cued system just like
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
you hear at some companies that will say
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
you know your pro you either answer the
 
01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
call or your approximate wait time is
 
01:42:31.350 --> 01:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
five minutes or your approximate wait
 
01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
time is 10 minutes and as you heard the
 
01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
average wait time is no more than 15
 
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
minutes now
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
so the gun line is no longer broke and
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
there's still room for improvement
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
we now have a person in charge of taking
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
faxes so that the faxes can be answered
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
right away and not just piled up in a
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
box and then someone calls them back
 
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
when they get around to it
 
01:42:57.590 --> 01:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
the the department has done yeoman's
 
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
work uh in fixing the problems um at the
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
gun line and they really um
 
01:43:05.669 --> 01:43:05.679 align:start position:0%
deserve some credit for getting
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
for getting that uh fixed
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
i don't see that sending this to the
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
state sheriffs works
 
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
i don't you know they talk about
 
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
training people with ten thousand
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
dollars a piece that's a one-time thing
 
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
you go from needing a few people on the
 
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
gun line at the state police
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
you're gonna need to train several
 
01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
people at each county and retrain people
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
when they leave when they're out on sick
 
01:43:31.830 --> 01:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
you know the gun line is a seven day
 
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
week operation
 
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
and many days 12 13 hours a day i'm not
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
sure the sheriffs are going to give that
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
kind of service um
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
to the guns coming back from the courts
 
01:43:44.229 --> 01:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
the guns coming you know getting guns
 
01:43:46.149 --> 01:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
back to innocent people of domestic
 
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
violence they're caught up they're doing
 
01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
their job and we need to let them uh
 
01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:52.629 align:start position:0%
their job and we need to let them uh
continue

01:43:52.629 --> 01:43:52.639 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
doing their job so
 
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions and i
 
01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
guess i would also say that the new
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire firearms coalition
 
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
is in opposition to this bill as written
 
01:44:06.149 --> 01:44:06.159 align:start position:0%
they would have one suggestion if you
 
01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
want to take this written policy that
 
01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
the gun line now has and make it into
 
01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
administrative rules or make it into law
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
that they must
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
um complete all all all checks instantly
 
01:44:21.189 --> 01:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
or 90 instantly um
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
then that would be a good idea and they
 
01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
would support codifying the policy that
 
01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
was put in place that is virtually
 
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
and almost completely corrected the
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony before
 
01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
questions were asked uh representative
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
wallace i
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
would you be able to keep uh being
 
01:44:46.229 --> 01:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
charged of the timer of which witnesses
 
01:44:46.239 --> 01:44:50.629 align:start position:0%
charged of the timer of which witnesses
testimony

01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative you will recognize your
 
01:44:54.239 --> 01:44:55.430 align:start position:0%
representative you will recognize your
question

01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
executive councilor wheeler for taking
 
01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
why do you think it is okay to use state
 
01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:06.390 align:start position:0%
why do you think it is okay to use state
employees

01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
and state tax dollars to fund a federal
 
01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
mandated program
 
01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:14.719 align:start position:0%
that the federal government will do for
 
01:45:14.719 --> 01:45:17.510 align:start position:0%
that the federal government will do for
free

01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
free
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
so well thank you for the question
 
01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:21.440 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh co-sponsoring the bill here because
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
if it wasn't for you highlighting the
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
problem uh maybe it wouldn't have got
 
01:45:29.669 --> 01:45:29.679 align:start position:0%
fixed so that's that's the good news
 
01:45:29.679 --> 01:45:30.470 align:start position:0%
fixed so that's that's the good news
here

01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.990 align:start position:0%
here
um

01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
i think that we do a much better job at
 
01:45:35.669 --> 01:45:35.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
and maybe most importantly when there is
 
01:45:41.590 --> 01:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
a mistaken identity
 
01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
um in the federal system or when uh you
 
01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:46.790 align:start position:0%
um in the federal system or when uh you
have

01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
robert smith's
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
we do a better job at figuring that out
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
right here in new hampshire
 
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
and so far this year i've brought four
 
01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
cases to the department of safety of the
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
people that were either
 
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
long-time delays or denies and got them
 
01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
corrected and gotten their firearms back
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
because you the 424 legislators and the
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
counselors can walk into that office
 
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
across the river and say look we got a
 
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
problem here
 
01:46:17.910 --> 01:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's an old conviction that's
 
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
out there 35 years old and people forgot
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
they had it
 
01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%
sometimes we've had a case where it's
 
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
the the feds had wrong information in
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
the computer and didn't read far enough
 
01:46:31.590 --> 01:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
when they put the documents in that said
 
01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
the case was dismissed
 
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
and we've corrected those situations and
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
all 424 of us can get those corrected if
 
01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
the state remains in the system and that
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
follow up representative
 
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman and thank
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
you for your um
 
01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
just last week
 
01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
saturday i heard that
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
a young store pretty close to me i was
 
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
talking to the person
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
said that
 
01:47:11.590 --> 01:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
they spent about two hours trying to
 
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
call into the gun line
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
eventually they answered their phone
 
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
so what my question is
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
have you
 
01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:23.030 align:start position:0%
have you
experienced

01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
any of these delays you know because how
 
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
many guns do you buy through a licensed
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
dealer so you may experience these
 
01:47:30.239 --> 01:47:32.310 align:start position:0%
dealer so you may experience these
delays

01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
delays
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question as well
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative burton i tell you what
 
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
several of us have been doing out in the
 
01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
field uh to verify what's going on
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
inside at the gun line
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
myself and other people that i know have
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
taken on three or four gun shops and and
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
called them regularly and say what do
 
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
you see you know what's going on in the
 
01:47:53.669 --> 01:47:53.679 align:start position:0%
field tell me what the truth is and
 
01:47:55.590 --> 01:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
these gun shops are telling me two
 
01:47:56.790 --> 01:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
things one
 
01:47:59.590 --> 01:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
the system has greatly improved and they
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
tell us where we need to fix things
 
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
and just recently it's just been just
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
recently that our queued up system has
 
01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:08.719 align:start position:0%
been added to the gun line so i don't
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
know how old this this information is
 
01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
and then we ask these gun shops a final
 
01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:14.629 align:start position:0%
and then we ask these gun shops a final
question

01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:14.639 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:48:16.709 --> 01:48:16.719 align:start position:0%
if you had the choice
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
and if the new hampshire gun line works
 
01:48:21.350 --> 01:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
well would you rather have the biden
 
01:48:23.590 --> 01:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
administration in charge of the gun line
 
01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
or would you rather have
 
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
people in charge of the gun line and the
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
answer is reasonable order i mean like
 
01:48:34.709 --> 01:48:34.719 align:start position:0%
biden what is this
 
01:48:34.719 --> 01:48:36.709 align:start position:0%
biden what is this
representative

01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative knight
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
you raised the point of order which you
 
01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
recommended to raise but all you said
 
01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
was yeah about fighting what is this
 
01:48:48.149 --> 01:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
okay my point of order is assuming that
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
we're putting onus on a presidency
 
01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:53.590 align:start position:0%
we're putting onus on a presidency
specific

01:48:53.590 --> 01:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:54.950 align:start position:0%
specific
representative

01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
just to clarify
 
01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
a clean order is appropriate when there
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
is a challenge to the rules or the
 
01:49:05.350 --> 01:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
decline being followed
 
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
in the committee so please expressly
 
01:49:09.590 --> 01:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
state which
 
01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:10.629 align:start position:0%
state which
rule

01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
rule
 
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr chair so should i take
 
01:49:23.590 --> 01:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
a crack at it
 
01:49:25.109 --> 01:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
that's your decision
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
yes i i call point of order because i
 
01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:30.790 align:start position:0%
think that
um

01:49:30.790 --> 01:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
putting onus on the committee's
 
01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:34.639 align:start position:0%
responsibility to choose between a
 
01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
specific president and what we do as a
 
01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
committee embody for our state is
 
01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:48.070 align:start position:0%
committee embody for our state is
inappropriate

01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
and thank you i will allow the witness
 
01:49:53.109 --> 01:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i will rephrase my
 
01:49:58.229 --> 01:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
or rephrase my answer and i will say
 
01:50:02.709 --> 01:50:02.719 align:start position:0%
with bills like h.r 1446 um
 
01:50:04.229 --> 01:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
sitting in congress and already have
 
01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
passed the house that could change the
 
01:50:08.790 --> 01:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
rules of how the gun line works
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
and no one knows for sure how that's
 
01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
going to come out of the hopper i want
 
01:50:15.750 --> 01:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in charge of
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
denials and approvals there's no one
 
01:50:20.229 --> 01:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
says the rules are going to be the same
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
for the fbi
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
and the state of new hampshire when that
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
legislation comes out of the offer
 
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
if it says the fbi may
 
01:50:32.390 --> 01:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
delay 10 days all instant checks then
 
01:50:34.149 --> 01:50:34.159 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire would not
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
have to delay
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
10 days and we would be in charge and
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
can still continue doing our instant
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
checks instantly
 
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
so um in the general gun control climate
 
01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
that's in washington i think new
 
01:50:52.070 --> 01:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative hopper you're recognized
 
01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
councillor wheeler for taking my
 
01:50:58.800 --> 01:50:59.910 align:start position:0%
councillor wheeler for taking my
question

01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
so is it your assertion
 
01:51:04.830 --> 01:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:51:08.310 --> 01:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
state should bypass the federal knicks
 
01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:09.590 align:start position:0%
state should bypass the federal knicks
check

01:51:09.590 --> 01:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
check
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
if laws change in bc
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
to alter the next check as it is now are
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
you saying that we can just issue a lot
 
01:51:18.719 --> 01:51:23.430 align:start position:0%
you saying that we can just issue a lot
of

01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:24.229 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative harper to
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
restate my answer it is it depends
 
01:51:31.590 --> 01:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
on the exact language that congress will
 
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
come out of the harper with with hr six
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
should it even get out of the hopper nix
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
is just a database and how you do use
 
01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
that database could be given discretion
 
01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh to the states if they say
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
may delay then we don't have to it all
 
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
depends and i don't trust uh the way it
 
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
would come out of the hopper down there
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
and i think we need to stay in charge we
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
need that flexibility we need to be able
 
01:51:59.669 --> 01:51:59.679 align:start position:0%
to fix it
 
01:52:02.070 --> 01:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
when people are unjustly denied or false
 
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
information gets entered into that
 
01:52:03.599 --> 01:52:08.430 align:start position:0%
information gets entered into that
database

01:52:08.430 --> 01:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:10.070 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

01:52:10.070 --> 01:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:52:15.669 --> 01:52:15.679 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
account for the wheeler do you think
 
01:52:20.229 --> 01:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
that the state should
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
give the department
 
01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
more people to help the implement this
 
01:52:26.159 --> 01:52:28.830 align:start position:0%
more people to help the implement this
gun

01:52:28.830 --> 01:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
line yes i support i support the
 
01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
positions uh in the budget
 
01:52:36.629 --> 01:52:36.639 align:start position:0%
um to give them the personnel they need
 
01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
to make the checks 100 of the time truly
 
01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.350 align:start position:0%
to make the checks 100 of the time truly
instant

01:52:41.350 --> 01:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
instant
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
and i think they've done a good job you
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
know using people who are uh
 
01:52:47.910 --> 01:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
need light duty work on workman's comp
 
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
it was a good place to put them uh it's
 
01:52:51.750 --> 01:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
a good place to use some troopers who
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
are actually troopers but they hadn't
 
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
gone through the academy yet i think
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
they're doing all they can to make it
 
01:52:59.669 --> 01:52:59.679 align:start position:0%
work now but we do need those permanent
 
01:52:59.679 --> 01:53:01.350 align:start position:0%
work now but we do need those permanent
positions

01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:53:04.229 --> 01:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.910 --> 01:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative also you are recognized

um just to i think i need i think i
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
01:53:30.070 --> 01:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
ask you since the gun line has been i
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
have two questions first the since the
 
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
gun line has been in his existence since
 
01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:37.109 align:start position:0%
gun line has been in his existence since
1993

01:53:37.109 --> 01:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
1993
 
01:53:38.830 --> 01:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
and has
 
01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
um served new hampshire through
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
five different presidential
 
01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:48.629 align:start position:0%
five different presidential
administrations

01:53:48.629 --> 01:53:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:48.639 --> 01:53:49.589 align:start position:0%
 
two

01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:53:52.629 --> 01:53:52.639 align:start position:0%
republican administrations and
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
now going into a third democratic
 
01:53:54.719 --> 01:53:56.149 align:start position:0%
now going into a third democratic
administration

01:53:56.149 --> 01:53:56.159 align:start position:0%
administration
 
01:53:58.470 --> 01:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
i heard your concern
 
01:53:58.480 --> 01:53:59.510 align:start position:0%
i heard your concern
that

01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:02.070 --> 01:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
somehow the gun line would be
 
01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
irreparably altered from its
 
01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:06.790 align:start position:0%
irreparably altered from its
um

01:54:06.790 --> 01:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
from the way that it's been moving since
 
01:54:11.669 --> 01:54:11.679 align:start position:0%
1993 what is it could you elaborate on
 
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
first i would state that i think the gun
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
line has had problems in the past
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
because they did not have a fixed policy
 
01:54:24.229 --> 01:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
at the state level
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
they have adopted the the knicks rules
 
01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
of clearing the deck after 88 days
 
01:54:34.629 --> 01:54:34.639 align:start position:0%
the knicks rules of 99
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
excuse me 90 of all checks will be
 
01:54:39.189 --> 01:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
instant um
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm saying that the climate in
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
washington has never been as anti-gun um
 
01:54:46.709 --> 01:54:46.719 align:start position:0%
as it is right now so things are
 
01:54:49.109 --> 01:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
different today i'll also
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:56.310 --> 01:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully you can see this 500 pages
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
of the next book the guidelines that it
 
01:55:02.070 --> 01:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
takes to run nicks 500 pages
 
01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think that the money is
 
01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
sufficient for the counties to because
 
01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
you talked about county money
 
01:55:09.510 --> 01:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
representative i don't think that money
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
is sufficient to train those people and
 
01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to train 10 different
 
01:55:15.589 --> 01:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
counties to do the job that should be
 
01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
centralized on one person um
 
01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
at the state level it just isn't going
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
to work at the county level
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized for a
 
01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
01:55:28.629 --> 01:55:28.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
um i would have i would agree um
 
01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
executive councilor wheeler that uh
 
01:55:38.310 --> 01:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
downshifting state responsibilities to
 
01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
count to the county is is definitely
 
01:55:42.870 --> 01:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
something we want to avoid because it
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
will raise our property taxes um my
 
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
question is that on page two of the bill
 
01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
and i don't remember if you had said you
 
01:55:52.709 --> 01:55:52.719 align:start position:0%
had it in front of you do you or shall i
 
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
read my
 
01:55:55.109 --> 01:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
please read it
 
01:55:55.119 --> 01:55:56.470 align:start position:0%
please read it
okay

01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying so on page two
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
for those who are following along
 
01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
page two lines eight nine and ten
 
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
it is um part one section c
 
01:56:09.189 --> 01:56:09.199 align:start position:0%
nothing in this chapter shall be
 
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
construed to limit prevent or impose
 
01:56:15.589 --> 01:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
background check requirements on the
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
private transfer of firearms as
 
01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:22.719 align:start position:0%
otherwise not prohibited by rsa 1 159 or
 
01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:24.950 align:start position:0%
federal law
so

01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:26.149 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:30.149 --> 01:56:30.159 align:start position:0%
regardless of anything else that's said
 
01:56:33.109 --> 01:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
in the four pages in fiscal note of this
 
01:56:33.119 --> 01:56:34.149 align:start position:0%
in the four pages in fiscal note of this
bill

01:56:34.149 --> 01:56:34.159 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:56:34.159 --> 01:56:35.350 align:start position:0%
bill
um

01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
there really is no infringement would
 
01:56:39.910 --> 01:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
you say on
 
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
people being able to
 
01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
purchase a firearm maybe not the one
 
01:56:47.189 --> 01:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
they want at the moment but the second
 
01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
amendment doesn't necessarily allow
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
supply you with what it is you want just
 
01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
what you nest what you think you need so
 
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
would you agree with that question so
 
01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:00.229 align:start position:0%
would you agree with that question so
yes

01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
your statement please ask questions of
 
01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
the witnesses the last time i'm going to
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
make this warning for members of the
 
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
you room a question the witness the
 
01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:12.149 align:start position:0%
you room a question the witness the
witness

01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
witness
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
may answer but members are not
 
01:57:17.109 --> 01:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
recognized to make a statement like that
 
01:57:19.109 --> 01:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
sorry mr chair could you clarify where
 
01:57:25.910 --> 01:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
um may i answer that well why is your
 
01:57:30.390 --> 01:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
question not appropriate the ruling is
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
that it really wasn't a question then
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
you corrected yourself by saying do you
 
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
agree with me so they're asking me if
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
you agree with your question
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
i didn't correct myself that was my
 
01:57:42.550 --> 01:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
question representative that's the
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
ruling of the chair
 
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
i will allow the witness to respond to
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
most part of that statement but the last
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
warning i'm gonna get because we're
 
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
gonna have a very long day
 
01:57:57.189 --> 01:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
if people if the members of this
 
01:57:59.189 --> 01:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
community wish to make
 
01:57:59.199 --> 01:58:00.870 align:start position:0%
community wish to make
statements

01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
statements
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
you have my word you will be recognized
 
01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
during an executive session
 
01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
to make speak on the bill or
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
if you really want
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
you're free to testify
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
there's no rule saying you can't
 
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
the only difference is if you testify
 
01:58:17.589 --> 01:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
you will not be committed to ask
 
01:58:17.599 --> 01:58:18.709 align:start position:0%
you will not be committed to ask
questions

01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:23.350 --> 01:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i would not
 
01:58:25.589 --> 01:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
interpret that that language that way at
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
all i believe that language refers to
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
the private sale of firearms and it is
 
01:58:31.990 --> 01:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
saying that none of this whole
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
background check stuff prohibits or can
 
01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
prohibit the private sale of firearms
 
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
from person to person without a federal
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
firearms license dealer
 
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
and they still would not need background
 
01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:56.790 align:start position:0%
and they still would not need background
checks

01:58:56.790 --> 01:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:03.189 --> 01:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
i want to thank thank the executive
 
01:59:07.270 --> 01:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
council for his testimony
 
01:59:13.830 --> 01:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:20.950 --> 01:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
represents just a reminder your
 
01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
testimony will be made in three minutes
 
01:59:25.350 --> 01:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully i'll be done in uh less than
 
01:59:27.270 --> 01:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
that i can um
 
01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
so i've
 
01:59:30.390 --> 01:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
learned a lot about a very complicated
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
issue i can only speak to the part about
 
01:59:32.719 --> 01:59:34.149 align:start position:0%
issue i can only speak to the part about
um

01:59:34.149 --> 01:59:34.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
about downshifting this to the sheriff's
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
office just i've been on the county
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
executive committee stratfor county
 
01:59:42.229 --> 01:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
which is medium-sized counties our uh
 
01:59:43.830 --> 01:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
our county sheriff's department like the
 
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
state police is already very very busy
 
01:59:47.669 --> 01:59:47.679 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
even if it only takes supposedly three
 
01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
minutes to run a check on the computer
 
01:59:52.790 --> 01:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
we have the dispatcher dude 11. that's
 
01:59:54.550 --> 01:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
still a significant
 
01:59:58.470 --> 01:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
burden on the one-time 10 000 payment
 
02:00:00.790 --> 02:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
um it's uh probably inadequate even for
 
02:00:02.709 --> 02:00:02.719 align:start position:0%
cowash county which is about the size of
 
02:00:02.719 --> 02:00:04.310 align:start position:0%
cowash county which is about the size of
a

02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
dairy of the town of derry but certainly
 
02:00:08.149 --> 02:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
it's grossly inadequate for stratfor
 
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
county and so it has to be paid for
 
02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere probably the
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
fairest thing would be a
 
02:00:16.390 --> 02:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
fee but that would be a new fee which is
 
02:00:18.709 --> 02:00:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh very politically unpalatable
 
02:00:21.109 --> 02:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
especially a new fee related to guns so
 
02:00:22.709 --> 02:00:22.719 align:start position:0%
this is an unfunded mandate to the
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
counties and um
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
so even though those has to do with guns
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
which are maybe a higher priority for
 
02:00:30.149 --> 02:00:30.159 align:start position:0%
some of us and other things that's still
 
02:00:33.189 --> 02:00:33.199 align:start position:0%
a uh unfunded mandate i don't see why
 
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
if the state police
 
02:00:37.109 --> 02:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
were struggling why uh
 
02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
why county sheriff's department would
 
02:00:40.229 --> 02:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily not just face the whole
 
02:00:42.070 --> 02:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
issues if we dumped that in our lab so i
 
02:00:44.149 --> 02:00:44.159 align:start position:0%
think that's uh
 
02:00:45.910 --> 02:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
that's at least one sign for me that
 
02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
this whole bill appears to me uh to be
 
02:00:49.990 --> 02:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
um as we like to say
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
not ready for prime time so i think
 
02:00:53.189 --> 02:00:53.199 align:start position:0%
probably uh
 
02:00:54.390 --> 02:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
probably you're not
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
probably it's
 
02:00:58.870 --> 02:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's probably my my general impression
 
02:01:00.790 --> 02:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
is it's so deeply flawed there's nothing
 
02:01:01.830 --> 02:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
you can do with it and you know the
 
02:01:04.470 --> 02:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
limited time we have left work on it so
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
i would probably
 
02:01:06.239 --> 02:01:07.350 align:start position:0%
i would probably
recommend

02:01:07.350 --> 02:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
it even though obviously the system you
 
02:01:11.109 --> 02:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
have is not working uh working perfectly
 
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
so that's basically
 
02:01:15.270 --> 02:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
that's basically just my comment on it
 
02:01:17.350 --> 02:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of uh
 
02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
i've learned a lot of technical details
 
02:01:21.430 --> 02:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
a very very complicated issue and um so
 
02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:22.390 align:start position:0%
a very very complicated issue and um so
i

02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:01:24.629 --> 02:01:24.639 align:start position:0%
only wouldn't presume to address any of
 
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
the other details but just downshifting
 
02:01:28.870 --> 02:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
through the county that's especially
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
with no training and no expenditure
 
02:01:33.910 --> 02:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
that's just uh going to be repeated
 
02:01:34.870 --> 02:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
they're just going to have the same
 
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
struggles that the
 
02:01:38.310 --> 02:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
state police did oh yes i'm on the
 
02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
judiciary committee so i can tell you
 
02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
the courts are not necessarily
 
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
co-located with the
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
sheriff's department's courts our
 
02:01:48.310 --> 02:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
judicial branch is separate from county
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
government and actually a lot of these
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
orders probably most of them actually
 
02:01:52.629 --> 02:01:52.639 align:start position:0%
are being
 
02:01:54.310 --> 02:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
issued by uh
 
02:01:55.990 --> 02:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
either the circuit court or the family
 
02:01:58.070 --> 02:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
division in the circuit court so in many
 
02:02:00.070 --> 02:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
counties you could be mine um no we're
 
02:02:01.990 --> 02:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
not even that court doesn't even meet at
 
02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
the courthouse so that's um
 
02:02:06.550 --> 02:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
so anyway
 
02:02:07.990 --> 02:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
you know this uh they put a lot of work
 
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
in this build but i think it needs so
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
much more work to be uh to work to like
 
02:02:13.270 --> 02:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
pass i think probably just gonna have to
 
02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:14.070 align:start position:0%
pass i think probably just gonna have to
uh

02:02:14.070 --> 02:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:16.470 --> 02:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
put it aside and i tell it or retain it
 
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
or whatever so uh thank you i'll be
 
02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions although
 
02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:20.709 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions although
you've

02:02:20.709 --> 02:02:20.719 align:start position:0%
you've
 
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
asked and heard a lot of questions
 
02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:25.420 align:start position:0%
asked and heard a lot of questions
already

02:02:25.420 --> 02:02:25.430 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:28.070 align:start position:0%

good morning chairman navis uh members
 
02:02:56.709 --> 02:02:56.719 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is richard head
 
02:02:58.550 --> 02:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
i am the government affairs coordinator
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch
 
02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
um just to point it out the written
 
02:03:03.669 --> 02:03:03.679 align:start position:0%
testimony the the joint written
 
02:03:05.990 --> 02:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
testimony of safety and the judicial
 
02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
branch was sent out on my outlook 247
 
02:03:11.910 --> 02:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon if you want to if
 
02:03:13.669 --> 02:03:13.679 align:start position:0%
you can locate her if you want to locate
 
02:03:13.679 --> 02:03:14.550 align:start position:0%
you can locate her if you want to locate
it

02:03:14.550 --> 02:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
and was sent to the link for
 
02:03:18.870 --> 02:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
email to all committee members
 
02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:19.830 align:start position:0%
email to all committee members
my

02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:03:21.669 --> 02:03:21.679 align:start position:0%
goal today is to provide information
 
02:03:23.589 --> 02:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
about the court's role differences
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
between the gun line check and the fbi
 
02:03:28.550 --> 02:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
check as it relates to the role the
 
02:03:30.149 --> 02:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
courts fill
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
currently we have staff that enters
 
02:03:35.669 --> 02:03:35.679 align:start position:0%
modifies and removes information
 
02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
um that relates to domestic or orders of
 
02:03:43.350 --> 02:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
protection that are issued by the court
 
02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
and and this is really indirectly
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
uploaded into the federal ncic database
 
02:03:53.189 --> 02:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
we issue or we use the uh the spots
 
02:03:55.790 --> 02:03:55.800 align:start position:0%
terminal system the state police online
 
02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
telecommunications system
 
02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
and from that so we input directly into
 
02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
that system which then automatically
 
02:04:05.589 --> 02:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
inputs into the ncic system
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
um nics is not itself a storage of data
 
02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's been i would describe it more like
 
02:04:15.030 --> 02:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
google which then goes out and searches
 
02:04:17.510 --> 02:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
databases and as you heard searches
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
three specific databases ncic triple i
 
02:04:22.870 --> 02:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
and the nix index
 
02:04:26.470 --> 02:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
and our data goes into where we can
 
02:04:29.589 --> 02:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
through the spots terminal into ncic
 
02:04:31.589 --> 02:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
the really four areas in which orders of
 
02:04:34.229 --> 02:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
protection are issued
 
02:04:36.149 --> 02:04:36.159 align:start position:0%
domestic violence
 
02:04:38.550 --> 02:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
petitions stalking petitions under the
 
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
child protection act
 
02:04:43.350 --> 02:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
and bail protective orders um so those
 
02:04:46.149 --> 02:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
are sort of the general areas in which
 
02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
protective orders are issued
 
02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
and that as a result of sort of that
 
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
statutory setup in the way in which
 
02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
matters are filed with the court that
 
02:04:58.390 --> 02:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
results in three places where data may
 
02:05:01.030 --> 02:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
be found regarding protective orders in
 
02:05:02.470 --> 02:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
those protective orders maybe
 
02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:04.070 align:start position:0%
those protective orders maybe
disqualifiers

02:05:04.070 --> 02:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
disqualifiers
 
02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
one is the data that we input directly
 
02:05:10.790 --> 02:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
through spots into ncic
 
02:05:12.790 --> 02:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
the second is and you heard the
 
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner reference this where a
 
02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
protective order is issued but the party
 
02:05:19.510 --> 02:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
filing it does not know the date of
 
02:05:22.310 --> 02:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
birth of the of the defendant
 
02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
and those are not your criminal cases
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
those are civil protective orders where
 
02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
the party who's filing simply doesn't
 
02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
have a relationship with the defendant
 
02:05:33.589 --> 02:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
that suggests that they know the date of
 
02:05:36.390 --> 02:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
birth so we have and it's a
 
02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
changeable list
 
02:05:40.229 --> 02:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
of about 50 to 70 names at any
 
02:05:41.830 --> 02:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
particular time
 
02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
where a protective order is issued but
 
02:05:46.229 --> 02:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
the the court has no information
 
02:05:49.030 --> 02:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
available to it about the day of earth
 
02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
and therefore we cannot upload it into
 
02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:52.229 align:start position:0%
and therefore we cannot upload it into
uh

02:05:52.229 --> 02:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
ncic because that date of birth is an
 
02:05:56.790 --> 02:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
essential component of what we put into
 
02:05:59.189 --> 02:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
the system through spots so we have a
 
02:06:01.109 --> 02:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
separate list we've
 
02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
faxed that to state police
 
02:06:05.430 --> 02:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis so that that is one of
 
02:06:08.149 --> 02:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
the databases they check in addition to
 
02:06:08.159 --> 02:06:09.270 align:start position:0%
the databases they check in addition to
nics

02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
nics
 
02:06:11.350 --> 02:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
and then when the sheriff makes service
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh or or whatever the other system is
 
02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
where we get a date of birth
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
we modify our list we input it into ncic
 
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
through the spot system and it comes off
 
02:06:26.149 --> 02:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
the no known date of birth list
 
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
so at any particular time they're 50 to
 
02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
70 some odd names on that list but it
 
02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
changes regularly as we learn date of
 
02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
birth they come off the list new filings
 
02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
come on and they go on the list
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
and then the third category are the
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
emergency domestic violence or the after
 
02:06:45.750 --> 02:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
hours criminal bail protective orders
 
02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:48.069 align:start position:0%
hours criminal bail protective orders
cbpo

02:06:48.069 --> 02:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
cbpo
 
02:06:49.750 --> 02:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
and they just
 
02:06:51.910 --> 02:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
because there's a manual process for
 
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
inputting data into spots and therefore
 
02:06:54.880 --> 02:06:56.390 align:start position:0%
inputting data into spots and therefore
ncic

02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
ncic
 
02:06:58.550 --> 02:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know that data has to get
 
02:07:01.109 --> 02:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
there's a delay although state police
 
02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
can have access to it it's not a long
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
delay but there is a delay
 
02:07:08.629 --> 02:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
um so as a as a third check
 
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh gun line looks into that
 
02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:12.790 align:start position:0%
uh gun line looks into that
if

02:07:12.790 --> 02:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
if you don't have it in front of you
 
02:07:16.069 --> 02:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
i'll describe it but on page four
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
of the written testimony we provided
 
02:07:21.990 --> 02:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh of the joint testimony it has it
 
02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
outlines three
 
02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:24.310 align:start position:0%
outlines three
uh

02:07:24.310 --> 02:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
graphs about how these systems work and
 
02:07:29.350 --> 02:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
what is reviewed and what would not be
 
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
reviewed if it changes to a fbi
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
mix check only
 
02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
and currently the as i said you know the
 
02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:38.550 align:start position:0%
and currently the as i said you know the
big

02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
big
 
02:07:41.189 --> 02:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
issue is going to be the
 
02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
list with no date of birth
 
02:07:46.069 --> 02:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
where there's a protective order issued
 
02:07:47.750 --> 02:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
the other is the emergency domestic
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
violence or the after hours criminal
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
bail protective orders
 
02:07:54.149 --> 02:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
and then you also heard the commissioner
 
02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
refer to the department of safety's
 
02:07:58.550 --> 02:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
database where they have essentially all
 
02:08:00.390 --> 02:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
the criminal cases
 
02:08:02.709 --> 02:08:02.719 align:start position:0%
and in in what happens is they check
 
02:08:05.430 --> 02:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
their database if it comes across a name
 
02:08:07.830 --> 02:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
and that does not have on their database
 
02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
and this is where i'll correct center
 
02:08:11.669 --> 02:08:11.679 align:start position:0%
guido a little bit it's not
 
02:08:14.550 --> 02:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
the judicial systems database it's the
 
02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
department of safety's database of
 
02:08:19.510 --> 02:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
criminal matters if they in their
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
database do not have a disposition of
 
02:08:23.510 --> 02:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
that case
 
02:08:25.669 --> 02:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
they contact the court clerk find out
 
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
what the disposition is if it was
 
02:08:30.069 --> 02:08:30.079 align:start position:0%
something that at that point should be
 
02:08:32.229 --> 02:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
uploaded into
 
02:08:35.109 --> 02:08:35.119 align:start position:0%
one of the next databases they do so
 
02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
um and if it shouldn't then it's not a
 
02:08:37.679 --> 02:08:39.270 align:start position:0%
um and if it shouldn't then it's not a
disqualifier

02:08:39.270 --> 02:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
disqualifier
 
02:08:41.510 --> 02:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
so the interaction with the court is
 
02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
safety will reach out to the court
 
02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
system find out the disposition and then
 
02:08:47.830 --> 02:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
update their records and really what
 
02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
is the clerk gets contacted for records
 
02:08:53.189 --> 02:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
that are essentially
 
02:08:55.030 --> 02:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
i think all the time
 
02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
free brady bill uh matters that are in
 
02:09:00.629 --> 02:09:00.639 align:start position:0%
the department of safety's database
 
02:09:04.550 --> 02:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:06.149 --> 02:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
the other thing that's missing and
 
02:09:09.750 --> 02:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
described in our testimony is
 
02:09:13.189 --> 02:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
under rsa 173b the domestic violence
 
02:09:13.199 --> 02:09:14.709 align:start position:0%
under rsa 173b the domestic violence
statue

02:09:14.709 --> 02:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
statue
 
02:09:16.709 --> 02:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
you a person
 
02:09:18.550 --> 02:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
who is subject to a protective order
 
02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
attempts to purchase a handgun
 
02:09:23.430 --> 02:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
the courts are notified and the courts
 
02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
notify the person who is protected by an
 
02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
active domestic violence order
 
02:09:31.109 --> 02:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
to inform them that there is an attempt
 
02:09:33.270 --> 02:09:33.280 align:start position:0%
to purchase a weapon by the person who
 
02:09:35.109 --> 02:09:35.119 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence order is issued
 
02:09:35.119 --> 02:09:36.069 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence order is issued
against

02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
against
 
02:09:37.750 --> 02:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
and that allows that person to take
 
02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
whatever additional safety measures that
 
02:09:42.069 --> 02:09:42.079 align:start position:0%
they believe is is necessary for their
 
02:09:43.350 --> 02:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
own protection
 
02:09:46.149 --> 02:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
if the fbi were to conduct that search
 
02:09:47.589 --> 02:09:47.599 align:start position:0%
they would not be reaching out to the
 
02:09:49.270 --> 02:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
courts to say that there had been a
 
02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:50.550 align:start position:0%
courts to say that there had been a
contact

02:09:50.550 --> 02:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
contact
 
02:09:52.149 --> 02:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
so that's a a
 
02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
an element that would not be
 
02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:55.990 align:start position:0%
an element that would not be
followed

02:09:55.990 --> 02:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
followed
 
02:09:58.950 --> 02:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
should the should the bill proceed
 
02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:01.750 align:start position:0%
should the should the bill proceed
um

02:10:01.750 --> 02:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
the other
 
02:10:05.109 --> 02:10:05.119 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of it and is within the
 
02:10:06.390 --> 02:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
bill itself
 
02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
on page 3 line 22
 
02:10:11.669 --> 02:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
it describes orders that are issued by
 
02:10:14.310 --> 02:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
the court under 173b
 
02:10:16.470 --> 02:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
which is the domestic violence
 
02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:17.430 align:start position:0%
which is the domestic violence
act

02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
act
 
02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
and 633 colon 3-a
 
02:10:22.149 --> 02:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
which is stalking
 
02:10:25.589 --> 02:10:25.599 align:start position:0%
in putting those directly into the
 
02:10:27.189 --> 02:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
nix system
 
02:10:29.189 --> 02:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
what's very unclear to us is what that
 
02:10:29.199 --> 02:10:30.550 align:start position:0%
what's very unclear to us is what that
means

02:10:30.550 --> 02:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
means
 
02:10:32.790 --> 02:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
is because we don't directly input into
 
02:10:34.709 --> 02:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
next we
 
02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
indirectly input into ncic through the
 
02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
spot system unclear that would still be
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
allowed but it does not include
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
and therefore we would not have under
 
02:10:48.709 --> 02:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
this as written statutory authority to
 
02:10:51.589 --> 02:10:51.599 align:start position:0%
enter into the system uh protective
 
02:10:54.550 --> 02:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
orders under 169c which is the child
 
02:10:58.149 --> 02:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
protection act or rsa 597 which is where
 
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
those bail protective orders come into
 
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
effect and they're simply not described
 
02:11:04.870 --> 02:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
in uh in the bill
 
02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:06.709 align:start position:0%
in uh in the bill
um

02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:08.310 --> 02:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
mr hey i do have to
 
02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
i apologize i appreciate the the uh the
 
02:11:16.550 --> 02:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
additional time
 
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh i'd be happy to answer uh any
 
02:11:21.750 --> 02:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee may have i
 
02:11:27.669 --> 02:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:29.910 --> 02:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
but uh i i do appreciate your testimony
 
02:11:32.229 --> 02:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
but i do have to ask someone who but
 
02:11:34.149 --> 02:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
the chair voting require uh
 
02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
would ask a question and i want to thank
 
02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question can you
 
02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
describe the process
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
of when if someone
 
02:11:44.069 --> 02:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
does have a disqualifying uh condition
 
02:11:45.910 --> 02:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
that can prevent them from purchasing a
 
02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:47.030 align:start position:0%
that can prevent them from purchasing a
firearm

02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
firearm
 
02:11:49.109 --> 02:11:49.119 align:start position:0%
it's in the mix
 
02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
02:11:51.910 --> 02:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
process of removing that
 
02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:53.350 align:start position:0%
process of removing that
disqualification

02:11:53.350 --> 02:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
disqualification
 
02:11:55.669 --> 02:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
like for example for domestic violence
 
02:11:55.679 --> 02:11:56.870 align:start position:0%
like for example for domestic violence
expire

02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
expire
 
02:11:59.189 --> 02:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
yep so it's similar to
 
02:12:00.950 --> 02:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
the process of putting in
 
02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:03.599 align:start position:0%
uh and again we go into the spot system
 
02:12:06.870 --> 02:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
we have the um ability with spots to
 
02:12:09.189 --> 02:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
enter to modify or remove
 
02:12:12.550 --> 02:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
so as the status changes of a protective
 
02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:15.599 align:start position:0%
order that data can be
 
02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
can be done by our staff relative to the
 
02:12:20.709 --> 02:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
to the protective order itself
 
02:12:20.719 --> 02:12:21.589 align:start position:0%
to the protective order itself
um

02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
and then with regard to the date of
 
02:12:23.679 --> 02:12:24.550 align:start position:0%
and then with regard to the date of
birth

02:12:24.550 --> 02:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
birth
 
02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:25.430 align:start position:0%
birth
list

02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
list
 
02:12:28.149 --> 02:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
as we get a date of birth that is then
 
02:12:31.750 --> 02:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
updated and uploaded into into
 
02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
ncic through spots and then would come
 
02:12:36.790 --> 02:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
off the separate
 
02:12:45.270 --> 02:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:47.990 --> 02:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you take my question
 
02:12:49.350 --> 02:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
representative hoffa you're recognized
 
02:12:52.149 --> 02:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
for a question uh thank you mr chairman
 
02:12:54.229 --> 02:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for taking my question
 
02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a hypothetical
 
02:12:57.520 --> 02:12:58.310 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a hypothetical
uh

02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:00.229 --> 02:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
let's say this year the federal
 
02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
government changes the criteria
 
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
for a nix check
 
02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:05.910 align:start position:0%
for a nix check
and

02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
decides that any nix check will only be
 
02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:10.229 align:start position:0%
decides that any nix check will only be
issued

02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
issued
 
02:13:13.750 --> 02:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
five days after it's been requested
 
02:13:15.990 --> 02:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
does the state have the authority to
 
02:13:19.270 --> 02:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
bypass that mixed check and issue
 
02:13:23.589 --> 02:13:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh release to allow a gun sale anyway
 
02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
so i think the
 
02:13:26.790 --> 02:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
if i unders thank you for the for the
 
02:13:29.830 --> 02:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
question if i understand correctly if if
 
02:13:31.189 --> 02:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
you're saying that the federal
 
02:13:33.510 --> 02:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
government change would prohibit
 
02:13:36.310 --> 02:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
essentially would would have a required
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
five-day delay
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
i think the answer would be if the gun
 
02:13:44.709 --> 02:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
line and i'm making an
 
02:13:46.550 --> 02:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
assumption here under what that law
 
02:13:49.270 --> 02:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
would say but if the gun line
 
02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
were able to access
 
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
nics and were they able to obtain
 
02:13:56.229 --> 02:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
information from nyx in less than five
 
02:13:56.239 --> 02:13:57.030 align:start position:0%
information from nyx in less than five
days

02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
days
 
02:13:59.589 --> 02:13:59.599 align:start position:0%
even though the fbi might be limited and
 
02:14:01.589 --> 02:14:01.599 align:start position:0%
prohibited from issuing
 
02:14:03.830 --> 02:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
in less than five days it would really
 
02:14:05.830 --> 02:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
depend upon how the law was written in
 
02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:07.270 align:start position:0%
depend upon how the law was written in
congress

02:14:07.270 --> 02:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
congress
 
02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:08.310 align:start position:0%
congress
if

02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:14:11.669 --> 02:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
congress did not prohibit a state from
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
a state authorized program from issuing
 
02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
in less than five days
 
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
then they could issue unless then
 
02:14:19.990 --> 02:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
and the person was qualified they should
 
02:14:22.470 --> 02:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
be able to issue in less than five days
 
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
if congress preempts the federal or the
 
02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
state program
 
02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh from doing that then i i would assume
 
02:14:31.189 --> 02:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
it would be required to follow the same
 
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
five-day rule
 
02:14:34.950 --> 02:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
but it would depend on how congress
 
02:14:36.149 --> 02:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
wrote that law
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:39.510 --> 02:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative recognized for a question
 
02:14:41.270 --> 02:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:14:46.069 --> 02:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:47.830 --> 02:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
you said
 
02:14:52.830 --> 02:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:56.629 --> 02:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
about domestic violence that the state
 
02:15:00.069 --> 02:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
police have access to that
 
02:15:00.079 --> 02:15:00.950 align:start position:0%
police have access to that
now

02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:15:02.709 --> 02:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
02:15:04.550 --> 02:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
we have the sheriff's that's going to do
 
02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
that part if this bill
 
02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:09.599 align:start position:0%
passes do you believe the sheriff will
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
do just as good of a job
 
02:15:13.990 --> 02:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
as the state police is currently doing
 
02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:14.950 align:start position:0%
as the state police is currently doing
on

02:15:14.950 --> 02:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:15:17.109 --> 02:15:17.119 align:start position:0%
making sure that nix understands that
 
02:15:20.229 --> 02:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
this person is prohibited
 
02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question i did not
 
02:15:23.350 --> 02:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
realize i went 11 minutes when you're
 
02:15:25.990 --> 02:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
talking it seems quicker um
 
02:15:29.430 --> 02:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
the the the one thing to make sure is
 
02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
clear is that the sheriff's role in the
 
02:15:33.910 --> 02:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
bill is limited to where there's a
 
02:15:36.870 --> 02:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
petition for a return a firearm
 
02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
and that's where senator gaido mentioned
 
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
there were about 450 500
 
02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:42.550 align:start position:0%
there were about 450 500
500

02:15:42.550 --> 02:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
500
 
02:15:45.189 --> 02:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
and sometimes or as many as 600
 
02:15:47.109 --> 02:15:47.119 align:start position:0%
but they would be essentially the
 
02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
court's interface with the with the fbi
 
02:15:53.030 --> 02:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
system with the federal system
 
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
and for those only the the sheriffs
 
02:15:58.470 --> 02:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
would be uh responsible for getting
 
02:16:01.830 --> 02:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh the next uh response back to the
 
02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:02.790 align:start position:0%
uh the next uh response back to the
court

02:16:02.790 --> 02:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
court
 
02:16:04.229 --> 02:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
so that we could determine whether or
 
02:16:07.109 --> 02:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
not the petition for return of a firearm
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
should be granted or not
 
02:16:11.589 --> 02:16:11.599 align:start position:0%
if it's a request from a federal firearm
 
02:16:14.790 --> 02:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
a federal licensee firearm licensee
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
that does not as i understand the bill
 
02:16:19.109 --> 02:16:19.119 align:start position:0%
go through the sheriffs that is a direct
 
02:16:22.069 --> 02:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
fbi uh request
 
02:16:24.629 --> 02:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify the way that the two
 
02:16:27.350 --> 02:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
lines in which requests are made
 
02:16:28.870 --> 02:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
separately that would specifically to
 
02:16:32.709 --> 02:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
your question has written no the the
 
02:16:35.669 --> 02:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
no date of birth list and the department
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
of safety's
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
list of of matters
 
02:16:42.549 --> 02:16:42.559 align:start position:0%
would not be searched by the sheriff or
 
02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
the fbi if it's the federal firearm
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
licensee that's
 
02:16:49.110 --> 02:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
that's doing the the search
 
02:16:51.429 --> 02:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
nor would they have
 
02:16:53.270 --> 02:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
under the bill the emergency domestic
 
02:16:55.030 --> 02:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
violence or the after hours criminal
 
02:16:56.790 --> 02:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
bail protective order
 
02:16:56.800 --> 02:17:01.750 align:start position:0%
bail protective order
list

02:17:01.750 --> 02:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:17:06.709 --> 02:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
taking my follow-up um
 
02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
but if i understand correctly the bill
 
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
instructs the courts to clean up their
 
02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:14.070 align:start position:0%
instructs the courts to clean up their
records

02:17:14.070 --> 02:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
records
 
02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
which you know i understand needs
 
02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:17.030 align:start position:0%
which you know i understand needs
cleaning

02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
cleaning
 
02:17:20.309 --> 02:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
and they are going to report this
 
02:17:22.389 --> 02:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
you know to next
 
02:17:22.399 --> 02:17:24.469 align:start position:0%
you know to next
so

02:17:24.469 --> 02:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:17:26.070 --> 02:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
i thank you for the question
 
02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think the bill requires us to
 
02:17:30.950 --> 02:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
clean up our records one just on that
 
02:17:32.389 --> 02:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
point the the records we're talking
 
02:17:33.910 --> 02:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
about so there there's
 
02:17:35.509 --> 02:17:35.519 align:start position:0%
in and i had mentioned this and i think
 
02:17:37.030 --> 02:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
senator guida had mentioned this there
 
02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
are about 170 000
 
02:17:40.950 --> 02:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
records that are in the department of
 
02:17:43.110 --> 02:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
safety's database it's not a court
 
02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:44.549 align:start position:0%
safety's database it's not a court
database

02:17:44.549 --> 02:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
database
 
02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
in which the the department of safety
 
02:17:48.469 --> 02:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
when they run the search on their
 
02:17:52.709 --> 02:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
database if it hits one of those 170 000
 
02:17:55.110 --> 02:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
that's where they call the court and say
 
02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
hey what was the disposition of this
 
02:17:59.750 --> 02:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
matter so that we can update our meaning
 
02:18:02.469 --> 02:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
the department of safety's database
 
02:18:05.349 --> 02:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
um there is nothing in the bill that
 
02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
instructs a cleanup of that
 
02:18:10.150 --> 02:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
um and as as
 
02:18:14.309 --> 02:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
i put in my fiscal note um to the senate
 
02:18:15.669 --> 02:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
which may be the one that you just
 
02:18:19.669 --> 02:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
received because i asked the clerk to to
 
02:18:21.910 --> 02:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
why it wasn't attached to the bill
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
um if we had to
 
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
um receive that list of 170 000 today
 
02:18:31.910 --> 02:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
and clean and essentially find out the
 
02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:33.349 align:start position:0%
and clean and essentially find out the
disposition

02:18:33.349 --> 02:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
disposition
 
02:18:35.190 --> 02:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
of what is in department of safety's
 
02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:36.389 align:start position:0%
of what is in department of safety's
records

02:18:36.389 --> 02:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
records
 
02:18:38.950 --> 02:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
there would be a a significant fiscal
 
02:18:41.830 --> 02:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
note associated with that um with that
 
02:18:43.349 --> 02:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
search because we would have to do it
 
02:18:43.359 --> 02:18:44.629 align:start position:0%
search because we would have to do it
essentially

02:18:44.629 --> 02:18:44.639 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
uh all at once instead of the current
 
02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
system which is if there's a hit
 
02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
the department of safety reaches out to
 
02:18:53.830 --> 02:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
us we spend the time to to find out what
 
02:18:56.309 --> 02:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
the disposition is and report that back
 
02:18:56.319 --> 02:18:57.110 align:start position:0%
the disposition is and report that back
to

02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:19:00.389 --> 02:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:01.669 --> 02:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
and i think you had a second question
 
02:19:03.110 --> 02:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
which i apologize i'm not sure i
 
02:19:06.709 --> 02:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
remember i did not no okay thank you
 
02:19:06.719 --> 02:19:07.990 align:start position:0%
remember i did not no okay thank you

thank you mr chair and uh nice to see

you mr head um in a different committee
 
02:19:24.150 --> 02:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
um my question today
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
my question today refers back to your
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
testimony you testified that
 
02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:29.910 align:start position:0%
testimony you testified that
there

02:19:29.910 --> 02:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:19:32.469 --> 02:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
is that correct that there are 50 to 70
 
02:19:34.870 --> 02:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
names at any particular time
 
02:19:37.429 --> 02:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
that don't have a date of birth attached
 
02:19:38.950 --> 02:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
and do you know
 
02:19:39.799 --> 02:19:39.809 align:start position:0%

if um
[Music]

02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:19:44.230 --> 02:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
of those at 50 to 70 names at any one
 
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
particular time how many of those are
 
02:19:49.030 --> 02:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
domestic violence
 
02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:52.160 align:start position:0%

02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:54.550 align:start position:0%
stalking or child protective
issues

02:19:54.550 --> 02:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:19:56.389 --> 02:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question they are all
 
02:19:58.710 --> 02:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
within those statutes i had mentioned
 
02:20:00.469 --> 02:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
domestic violence stalking or child
 
02:20:00.479 --> 02:20:02.070 align:start position:0%
domestic violence stalking or child
protection

02:20:02.070 --> 02:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
protection
 
02:20:03.670 --> 02:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
so that's where the protective orders
 
02:20:06.550 --> 02:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
are issued through
 
02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:07.349 align:start position:0%
are issued through
and

02:20:07.349 --> 02:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:20:10.790 --> 02:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
and as i said that's a 50 to 70 is is
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
about the average that will be on that
 
02:20:14.710 --> 02:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
list at any one time
 
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
and it's a continuously changing list as
 
02:20:20.550 --> 02:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
we learn dates of birth or
 
02:20:22.309 --> 02:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
new matters are filed
 
02:20:24.389 --> 02:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
where we don't have dates of birth and
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
again in our written testimony we
 
02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
provided some examples of of how that
 
02:20:30.309 --> 02:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
could come to happen
 
02:20:33.110 --> 02:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
you know for example a store clerk who
 
02:20:36.230 --> 02:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
is asked out on a date who declines who
 
02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:37.670 align:start position:0%
is asked out on a date who declines who
then

02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:20:39.910 --> 02:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
the customer becomes more aggressive and
 
02:20:41.670 --> 02:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
starts threatening
 
02:20:44.790 --> 02:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
and ultimately that clerk
 
02:20:46.950 --> 02:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
gets a protective order because of the
 
02:20:48.469 --> 02:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
nature of the threats that are being
 
02:20:50.389 --> 02:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
issued against that clerk the clerk has
 
02:20:53.110 --> 02:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
no reason to know the date of birth but
 
02:20:54.469 --> 02:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
it would fall within the stalking
 
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
petition but they don't have that type
 
02:20:56.160 --> 02:20:56.830 align:start position:0%
petition but they don't have that type
of

02:20:56.830 --> 02:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
relationship uh to know what the date of
 
02:21:00.309 --> 02:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
birth would be
 
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
so when the when that ultimately that
 
02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
complaint gets served the sheriff can
 
02:21:06.469 --> 02:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
identify that or can learn the date of
 
02:21:10.070 --> 02:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
birth from the party or in a filing uh
 
02:21:12.070 --> 02:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
that it happens at the beginning the
 
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
court can get the date of birth and then
 
02:21:15.990 --> 02:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
that list would be updated
 
02:21:17.990 --> 02:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
and we try to do it obviously as quickly
 
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
as we can
 
02:21:21.990 --> 02:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
but it is dependent upon when that data
 
02:21:24.389 --> 02:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
can come back from the sheriff or
 
02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
if not from the sheriff when the when
 
02:21:29.349 --> 02:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:31.030 --> 02:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
follow up please
 
02:21:32.710 --> 02:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative also you're recognized
 
02:21:35.190 --> 02:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up question
 
02:21:36.790 --> 02:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:21:38.710 --> 02:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
so mr head going
 
02:21:40.710 --> 02:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
referring back to the example that you
 
02:21:41.910 --> 02:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
just gave
 
02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:43.110 align:start position:0%
just gave
um

02:21:43.110 --> 02:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:46.230 --> 02:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
since a uh the clerk in this example
 
02:21:48.790 --> 02:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the date of birth but files
 
02:21:50.790 --> 02:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
for an emergency protective order
 
02:21:54.870 --> 02:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
through 633 for stalking um would the
 
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
person that is the file the the order
 
02:21:59.830 --> 02:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
you know who had been harassing her or
 
02:21:59.840 --> 02:22:00.790 align:start position:0%
you know who had been harassing her or
him

02:22:00.790 --> 02:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
him
 
02:22:00.800 --> 02:22:01.830 align:start position:0%
him
um

02:22:01.830 --> 02:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:04.309 --> 02:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
would that person now because there's no
 
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
date of birth
 
02:22:07.030 --> 02:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
attached to that
 
02:22:09.750 --> 02:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
be in that in a space where they would
 
02:22:12.550 --> 02:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
would be able to purchase a firearm
 
02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:15.349 align:start position:0%
would be able to purchase a firearm
through

02:22:15.349 --> 02:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:17.110 --> 02:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you for the question
 
02:22:20.830 --> 02:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
if the check were to go only through
 
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
nyx so the part of the gun line that
 
02:22:26.469 --> 02:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
goes through nyx or fbi which only goes
 
02:22:28.389 --> 02:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
through nics
 
02:22:30.150 --> 02:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
they would not see that person because
 
02:22:32.469 --> 02:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
it can't the data cannot be entered into
 
02:22:34.630 --> 02:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
the database without the date of birth
 
02:22:36.710 --> 02:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
so they would just be invisible to the
 
02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:38.150 align:start position:0%
so they would just be invisible to the
fbi

02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
fbi
 
02:22:39.510 --> 02:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
but because
 
02:22:42.230 --> 02:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
gunline does receive that list
 
02:22:45.510 --> 02:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
and gunline does review that list when a
 
02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:46.870 align:start position:0%
and gunline does review that list when a
request

02:22:46.870 --> 02:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
request
 
02:22:49.270 --> 02:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
comes in for a purchase
 
02:22:49.280 --> 02:22:50.870 align:start position:0%
comes in for a purchase
[Music]

02:22:50.870 --> 02:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:22:52.469 --> 02:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
they would they would then be able to
 
02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
say there's a disqualifying event
 
02:22:57.590 --> 02:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
as a result of of the protective order
 
02:22:59.270 --> 02:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
and as you heard from
 
02:23:01.670 --> 02:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
lieutenant mcquade it does require some
 
02:23:03.030 --> 02:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
additional research on their part
 
02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
because you know they're not all john
 
02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
smith they may have unique names but
 
02:23:08.710 --> 02:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
they need to then identify whether or
 
02:23:10.630 --> 02:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
not there is sufficient information to
 
02:23:11.830 --> 02:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
say whether or not there's a
 
02:23:13.590 --> 02:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
disqualifying event
 
02:23:16.309 --> 02:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
but they do have that list and gunline
 
02:23:18.950 --> 02:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
does review it every time they have a
 
02:23:21.750 --> 02:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
request and if there's a hit and it's a
 
02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:23.510 align:start position:0%
request and if there's a hit and it's a
disqualifier

02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
disqualifier
 
02:23:25.270 --> 02:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
then uh
 
02:23:26.870 --> 02:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
then that would be disqualified which
 
02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
would not which would just not be seen
 
02:23:33.750 --> 02:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:38.870 --> 02:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized
 
02:23:40.870 --> 02:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr
 
02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:42.469 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr
question

02:23:42.469 --> 02:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:23:44.710 --> 02:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
obviously i don't know much about the
 
02:23:47.990 --> 02:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
gun line i should be asking for a friend
 
02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.150 align:start position:0%
gun line i should be asking for a friend
but

02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:23:51.590 --> 02:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
somebody said
 
02:23:53.590 --> 02:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
i think that the gun line is only
 
02:23:53.600 --> 02:23:54.950 align:start position:0%
i think that the gun line is only
authorized

02:23:54.950 --> 02:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
02:23:56.469 --> 02:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
to use
 
02:23:58.469 --> 02:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
the next system
 
02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:05.910 --> 02:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
data entry
 
02:24:07.590 --> 02:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
if somebody's going to buy
 
02:24:12.389 --> 02:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:12.399 --> 02:24:13.110 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:24:13.110 --> 02:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:24:15.429 --> 02:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
the gun deal gives information to the
 
02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
fbi and the fbi
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
runs a next search
 
02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
as opposed to in new hampshire if
 
02:24:25.270 --> 02:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to buy a
 
02:24:25.280 --> 02:24:26.550 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to buy a
firearm

02:24:26.550 --> 02:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
firearm
 
02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:27.349 align:start position:0%
firearm
that

02:24:27.349 --> 02:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:24:30.389 --> 02:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
the gun dealer gives that information
 
02:24:33.190 --> 02:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
to the gun line and they run a next
 
02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:34.389 align:start position:0%
to the gun line and they run a next
search

02:24:34.389 --> 02:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
search
 
02:24:36.550 --> 02:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
is there any difference between
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
the next search the fbi did the
 
02:24:39.359 --> 02:24:40.710 align:start position:0%
the next search the fbi did the
writer

02:24:40.710 --> 02:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
writer
 
02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
and the next search
 
02:24:47.830 --> 02:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:49.590 --> 02:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i it's a
 
02:24:52.150 --> 02:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
great question because um i do i think
 
02:24:54.230 --> 02:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
it is worth clarifying
 
02:24:56.870 --> 02:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
this this point which is really what is
 
02:24:58.630 --> 02:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
the statute say
 
02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh as to safety's role and it's 159
 
02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
dash d colon 1
 
02:25:06.630 --> 02:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
which says the department of safety may
 
02:25:08.469 --> 02:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
become the point of contact for the
 
02:25:10.309 --> 02:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
federal government for the purposes of
 
02:25:12.389 --> 02:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
the national instant criminal background
 
02:25:14.150 --> 02:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
check system next
 
02:25:16.230 --> 02:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the statutory that's
 
02:25:18.870 --> 02:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
the requirement in order to
 
02:25:22.230 --> 02:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh to become a point of contact uh for
 
02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:23.429 align:start position:0%
uh to become a point of contact uh for
fbi

02:25:23.429 --> 02:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
fbi
 
02:25:26.070 --> 02:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
it is not it does not say
 
02:25:27.750 --> 02:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
and really the the question goes should
 
02:25:29.349 --> 02:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
go to the attorney general's office but
 
02:25:30.710 --> 02:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the attorney
 
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
02:25:33.910 --> 02:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
and the attorney general worked with the
 
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
department of safety to come up with the
 
02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
policy based upon the statutory
 
02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:39.270 align:start position:0%
policy based upon the statutory
authority

02:25:39.270 --> 02:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
authority
 
02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
but it is not it does not say
 
02:25:45.750 --> 02:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
department of safety you can only do a
 
02:25:48.150 --> 02:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
next background check it is a an
 
02:25:50.950 --> 02:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
authorizing statute which says
 
02:25:52.469 --> 02:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
which is required
 
02:25:54.550 --> 02:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
department of safety you are authorized
 
02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
to become the point of contact for the
 
02:25:57.830 --> 02:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
for purposes of nics and then
 
02:26:03.270 --> 02:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
we have in fact implemented that and in
 
02:26:04.870 --> 02:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
through what we
 
02:26:07.030 --> 02:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
call the gun line but the the permitting
 
02:26:09.670 --> 02:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
group at the department of safety
 
02:26:11.910 --> 02:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
they are the the point of contact as
 
02:26:15.110 --> 02:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
authorized by the statute it does not in
 
02:26:17.270 --> 02:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
the in the c in the content of that
 
02:26:20.230 --> 02:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
statute limit them to nix it just simply
 
02:26:22.070 --> 02:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
says that they can be
 
02:26:24.630 --> 02:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh it may be the point of contact
 
02:26:27.349 --> 02:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
um but i think in terms of the authority
 
02:26:27.359 --> 02:26:28.309 align:start position:0%
um but i think in terms of the authority
of

02:26:28.309 --> 02:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:26:30.790 --> 02:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
safety you know it's a better question
 
02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:31.510 align:start position:0%
safety you know it's a better question
for

02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire department of justice and
 
02:26:34.870 --> 02:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
the attorney general but it's at least
 
02:26:36.790 --> 02:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
my understanding
 
02:26:39.429 --> 02:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
that the attorney general has been
 
02:26:41.110 --> 02:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
working with with the department of
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
safety and putting that policy together
 
02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
within the context of the statutory
 
02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:48.230 align:start position:0%
within the context of the statutory
authority

02:26:48.230 --> 02:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
authority
 
02:26:50.070 --> 02:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative newman you're
 
02:26:53.750 --> 02:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:55.750 --> 02:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thank you the
 
02:26:57.910 --> 02:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
witness for taking my question
 
02:26:57.920 --> 02:26:58.710 align:start position:0%
witness for taking my question
um

02:26:58.710 --> 02:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:01.270 --> 02:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
in the bill on i don't have all the line
 
02:27:03.910 --> 02:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
numbers but on page two section
 
02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:05.830 align:start position:0%
numbers but on page two section
two

02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:27:08.429 --> 02:27:08.439 align:start position:0%
it says that rsa
 
02:27:11.030 --> 02:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
d159 d1 and
 
02:27:13.270 --> 02:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
159 d2
 
02:27:15.510 --> 02:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
are repealed and re-enacted to read as
 
02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:16.550 align:start position:0%
are repealed and re-enacted to read as
follows

02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
follows
 
02:27:19.110 --> 02:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult when they put new
 
02:27:21.030 --> 02:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
when they completely repeal something to
 
02:27:23.110 --> 02:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
compare the new to the old
 
02:27:25.830 --> 02:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
could you just briefly describe
 
02:27:28.389 --> 02:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
what differences you see in the changes
 
02:27:34.870 --> 02:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:36.309 --> 02:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sure
 
02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
they they are
 
02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:39.270 align:start position:0%
they they are
uh

02:27:39.270 --> 02:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:27:42.070 --> 02:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
fair to say nothing alike
 
02:27:45.270 --> 02:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
um so 159d
 
02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:46.469 align:start position:0%
um so 159d
uh

02:27:46.469 --> 02:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
currently gives the gun line through
 
02:27:51.750 --> 02:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
essentially the department of safety uh
 
02:27:54.870 --> 02:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
authority to be the point of contact
 
02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
and then 150 the current version excuse
 
02:28:00.070 --> 02:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
me of 159 d2
 
02:28:02.070 --> 02:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
it instructs the department of safety
 
02:28:04.630 --> 02:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
regarding confidentiality
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
and section 3 of 159 it's only three
 
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
sections talks about the penalties for
 
02:28:12.950 --> 02:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
the attempts to purchase illegally
 
02:28:15.590 --> 02:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
so i think it's it's fair to say and i i
 
02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
agree with your point it
 
02:28:18.870 --> 02:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
becomes incredibly hard to compare when
 
02:28:20.630 --> 02:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
it's uh just a complete replacement you
 
02:28:23.190 --> 02:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
know the bold or the strikeouts but in
 
02:28:25.429 --> 02:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
this case um i think it's fair to say
 
02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
that this is entirely new
 
02:28:30.550 --> 02:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
and uh and then by virtue of what's at
 
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
the end of the of the bill
 
02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:34.870 align:start position:0%
the end of the of the bill
um

02:28:34.870 --> 02:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
under par under section five of the bill
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
it says
 
02:28:41.429 --> 02:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire state gun line
 
02:28:43.110 --> 02:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
in the permits and licensing unit the
 
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
division of state police department of
 
02:28:46.710 --> 02:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
safety is hereby abolished so it
 
02:28:49.349 --> 02:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
essentially eliminates the the gun line
 
02:28:51.910 --> 02:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
in part five of the bill and this
 
02:28:54.790 --> 02:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
section is entirely new and and i do
 
02:28:55.990 --> 02:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
point out
 
02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
you know this
 
02:28:58.550 --> 02:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
in that in that section that you're
 
02:29:01.030 --> 02:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
reading part page two
 
02:29:04.150 --> 02:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
it references uh restraining orders
 
02:29:08.230 --> 02:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
under 173b and 633 colon 3a which are
 
02:29:10.710 --> 02:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and stalking but again
 
02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
in that section similar to what's in
 
02:29:15.190 --> 02:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
part three of the bill where we're
 
02:29:18.469 --> 02:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
authorized to input data into nics
 
02:29:21.670 --> 02:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
it does not include 169c the child
 
02:29:25.830 --> 02:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
protection act or 597 the uh
 
02:29:27.510 --> 02:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
the the bail
 
02:29:29.349 --> 02:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
protective act
 
02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
or i'm sorry the
 
02:29:33.270 --> 02:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
criminal bail protective orders
 
02:29:34.950 --> 02:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
they're simply not referenced in either
 
02:29:36.630 --> 02:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
of those two sections of the of the
 
02:29:39.429 --> 02:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
statute but both are important sources
 
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
of information regarding protective
 
02:29:41.520 --> 02:29:42.630 align:start position:0%
of information regarding protective
orders

02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
orders
 
02:29:45.429 --> 02:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
uh for for those who who
 
02:29:47.750 --> 02:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh have protective orders to for their
 
02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:50.150 align:start position:0%
uh have protective orders to for their
safety

02:29:50.150 --> 02:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
safety
 
02:29:53.030 --> 02:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:54.550 --> 02:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
representative newman you recognize for
 
02:29:55.970 --> 02:29:55.980 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question
 
02:29:55.980 --> 02:29:57.190 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question
[Music]

02:29:57.190 --> 02:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:29:58.950 --> 02:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and based on thank you for
 
02:30:00.550 --> 02:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
that description
 
02:30:02.870 --> 02:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
um and but
 
02:30:04.469 --> 02:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
based on that
 
02:30:06.710 --> 02:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
do you think that the changes that have
 
02:30:07.990 --> 02:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
been made
 
02:30:10.469 --> 02:30:10.479 align:start position:0%
to to those laws
 
02:30:12.710 --> 02:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
would be more effective in correcting
 
02:30:15.349 --> 02:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
the problems that that you wrestle with
 
02:30:16.790 --> 02:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
being able to identify
 
02:30:21.349 --> 02:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
people and being able to identify
 
02:30:23.670 --> 02:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
whether uh the current uh restraining
 
02:30:25.030 --> 02:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
orders and all that kind of things that
 
02:30:26.309 --> 02:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
you mentioned
 
02:30:26.319 --> 02:30:28.389 align:start position:0%
you mentioned
um

02:30:28.389 --> 02:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:30.630 --> 02:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
does it make it better or worse to be
 
02:30:32.469 --> 02:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
able to carry out the changes that you
 
02:30:34.950 --> 02:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
think you have done
 
02:30:39.270 --> 02:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:42.870 --> 02:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
as written the bill would
 
02:30:44.550 --> 02:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
and and really actually probably can't
 
02:30:46.710 --> 02:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
be written any differently if if the fbi
 
02:30:48.309 --> 02:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
is doing the search
 
02:30:48.319 --> 02:30:49.030 align:start position:0%
is doing the search
because

02:30:49.030 --> 02:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:30:51.670 --> 02:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:54.630 --> 02:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill is to provide a
 
02:30:57.670 --> 02:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
nics system only background check
 
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
it and that's the end of the search
 
02:31:02.870 --> 02:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
under if this bill were to pass
 
02:31:06.150 --> 02:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
and what that would not then ever
 
02:31:06.160 --> 02:31:06.950 align:start position:0%
and what that would not then ever
see

02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:31:09.590 --> 02:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
because the fbi simply can't see it
 
02:31:11.750 --> 02:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't and can't be uploaded
 
02:31:13.110 --> 02:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
to nyx
 
02:31:14.550 --> 02:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
is the
 
02:31:18.150 --> 02:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
um the list of 50 to 70
 
02:31:18.160 --> 02:31:19.429 align:start position:0%
um the list of 50 to 70
orders

02:31:19.429 --> 02:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
orders
 
02:31:21.270 --> 02:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
or parties and the defendants in those
 
02:31:23.510 --> 02:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
cases where we don't have a date of
 
02:31:23.520 --> 02:31:24.710 align:start position:0%
cases where we don't have a date of
birth

02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
birth
 
02:31:26.950 --> 02:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
and that just can't change
 
02:31:29.590 --> 02:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
or to um if
 
02:31:31.349 --> 02:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
you know those that are the emergency
 
02:31:33.590 --> 02:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
domestic violence or the after hours
 
02:31:35.910 --> 02:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
criminal bail protective orders
 
02:31:38.630 --> 02:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
which do not get immediately uploaded um
 
02:31:40.150 --> 02:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
into the system
 
02:31:43.349 --> 02:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
and and there even if there was a way to
 
02:31:45.030 --> 02:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
put a
 
02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
in my understanding is there's not but
 
02:31:49.110 --> 02:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
even if there's a way to put a person's
 
02:31:51.030 --> 02:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
name into
 
02:31:54.550 --> 02:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
the nix index without if date of birth
 
02:31:56.389 --> 02:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
and everything i've seen from fbi
 
02:31:58.150 --> 02:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
guidance says that you need a date of
 
02:31:58.160 --> 02:31:59.030 align:start position:0%
guidance says that you need a date of
birth

02:31:59.030 --> 02:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
birth
 
02:32:01.510 --> 02:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
but if you were to be able to fbi still
 
02:32:02.870 --> 02:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't capture that because they're
 
02:32:04.790 --> 02:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
looking for person
 
02:32:07.270 --> 02:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
and date of birth
 
02:32:08.950 --> 02:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
and that date of birth simply doesn't
 
02:32:12.309 --> 02:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
exist so the the search that is
 
02:32:14.389 --> 02:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
currently done by gunline
 
02:32:16.630 --> 02:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
would just simply not be replicated
 
02:32:16.640 --> 02:32:17.750 align:start position:0%
would just simply not be replicated
through

02:32:17.750 --> 02:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:32:20.309 --> 02:32:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh through this process and and that's a
 
02:32:21.990 --> 02:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know i get that's a policy decision
 
02:32:23.590 --> 02:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
of the legislature
 
02:32:26.550 --> 02:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
and so what my purpose my testimony is
 
02:32:28.630 --> 02:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
simply to identify those areas that
 
02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
would change substantively which are you
 
02:32:34.309 --> 02:32:34.319 align:start position:0%
know there are these these
 
02:32:37.349 --> 02:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
important areas where there is
 
02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
a domestic violence
 
02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:41.510 align:start position:0%
a domestic violence
order

02:32:41.510 --> 02:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
order
 
02:32:43.830 --> 02:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
that would simply not be captured in a
 
02:32:47.750 --> 02:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
in a short window of time by the fbi and
 
02:32:50.550 --> 02:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
within that window a purchase a handgun
 
02:32:53.190 --> 02:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
purchase could be made that under the
 
02:32:55.030 --> 02:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
under the gun line system would get
 
02:32:55.040 --> 02:32:56.550 align:start position:0%
under the gun line system would get
caught

02:32:56.550 --> 02:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
caught
 
02:32:59.510 --> 02:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
in a disqualifier would be identified
 
02:33:01.590 --> 02:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
and and on the flip side uh as
 
02:33:03.270 --> 02:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner said
 
02:33:07.429 --> 02:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
in the nix database so for example if
 
02:33:09.110 --> 02:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know the data doesn't
 
02:33:10.950 --> 02:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
always get uploaded so if we have a new
 
02:33:14.150 --> 02:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire resident who lived in georgia
 
02:33:14.160 --> 02:33:16.309 align:start position:0%
hampshire resident who lived in georgia
and

02:33:16.309 --> 02:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:33:17.429 --> 02:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
and that
 
02:33:20.630 --> 02:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
shows an arrest in the next database for
 
02:33:23.750 --> 02:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
a disqualifying event but the arrest is
 
02:33:25.429 --> 02:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
is relatively old
 
02:33:28.550 --> 02:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
the gun line can reach out to georgia
 
02:33:31.270 --> 02:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
and find out if there was ever a
 
02:33:33.990 --> 02:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
conviction or if it was found not guilty
 
02:33:35.830 --> 02:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
and that's data simply did not get
 
02:33:38.070 --> 02:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
uploaded into nics because nix is only
 
02:33:40.070 --> 02:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
as good as the data that's uploaded to
 
02:33:40.080 --> 02:33:40.710 align:start position:0%
as good as the data that's uploaded to
it

02:33:40.710 --> 02:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:33:42.710 --> 02:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
and if in fact that per that case was
 
02:33:45.510 --> 02:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
dismissed or there was a no not guilty
 
02:33:45.520 --> 02:33:46.710 align:start position:0%
dismissed or there was a no not guilty
finding

02:33:46.710 --> 02:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
finding
 
02:33:49.110 --> 02:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
then what could come out as a delay or a
 
02:33:51.750 --> 02:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
disqualifier from the fbi
 
02:33:53.510 --> 02:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
would get processed by the gun line as
 
02:33:55.190 --> 02:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
qualified because the additional
 
02:33:58.630 --> 02:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
research that the gun line does
 
02:34:03.590 --> 02:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that uh
 
02:34:07.270 --> 02:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
clarification and i think it uh it
 
02:34:09.030 --> 02:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
helped a lot in clarifying the
 
02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
differences between the two systems
 
02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you great you're welcome
 
02:34:15.530 --> 02:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
you know for the hands right
 
02:34:15.540 --> 02:34:20.230 align:start position:0%
you know for the hands right

and as a reminder
 
02:35:16.630 --> 02:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
testimony will be limited to the
 
02:35:18.230 --> 02:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
three-man side will do a better job of
 
02:35:21.670 --> 02:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:23.910 --> 02:35:23.920 align:start position:0%

lawyer practicing here in new hampshire
 
02:35:37.830 --> 02:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
i focus on the area of firearms law
 
02:35:41.190 --> 02:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
sitting next to me is jim macleod the
 
02:35:42.870 --> 02:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
owner of shooter's outpost we're
 
02:35:45.110 --> 02:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
actually at shooter's outpost
 
02:35:47.590 --> 02:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
as i testify now i'm not going to go
 
02:35:49.590 --> 02:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
into my credentials and waste time i
 
02:35:51.750 --> 02:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
will say that i spend a significant
 
02:35:53.830 --> 02:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
amount of time in addition to gun law
 
02:35:55.830 --> 02:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
representing domestic violence victims
 
02:35:58.230 --> 02:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
through the domestic violence emergency
 
02:36:02.389 --> 02:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
project it is a um a primary interest of
 
02:36:05.030 --> 02:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
mine so i want to i want to correct some
 
02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
things as quickly as possible
 
02:36:09.910 --> 02:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
first off i just want to point out that
 
02:36:12.469 --> 02:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
i think it's beyond clear now that the
 
02:36:15.030 --> 02:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
department of safety and the judiciary
 
02:36:17.190 --> 02:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
are in fact in opposition to senate bill
 
02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:18.550 align:start position:0%
are in fact in opposition to senate bill
141

02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
141
 
02:36:20.950 --> 02:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
despite stating that they're taking a
 
02:36:22.630 --> 02:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
neutral position you
 
02:36:24.070 --> 02:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
they won't make a single positive
 
02:36:25.910 --> 02:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
statement about the bill
 
02:36:28.309 --> 02:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
all this being said
 
02:36:30.230 --> 02:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
allow me to explain that
 
02:36:32.950 --> 02:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
the next system first off is not just a
 
02:36:35.349 --> 02:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
series of databases there's a call
 
02:36:37.830 --> 02:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
center in west virginia that is staffed
 
02:36:40.230 --> 02:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
with a massive staff that actually does
 
02:36:42.790 --> 02:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
do research i'm not sure where this
 
02:36:44.150 --> 02:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
false presumption that they don't do
 
02:36:45.910 --> 02:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
research comes from
 
02:36:45.920 --> 02:36:46.710 align:start position:0%
research comes from
um

02:36:46.710 --> 02:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:49.990 --> 02:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
just to give an example it's very common
 
02:36:52.710 --> 02:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
for people to be denied based on having
 
02:36:55.349 --> 02:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
a domestic violence qualifier by the
 
02:36:55.359 --> 02:36:57.270 align:start position:0%
a domestic violence qualifier by the
feds

02:36:57.270 --> 02:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
feds
 
02:36:59.190 --> 02:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
even though it's just charged as a
 
02:37:01.590 --> 02:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
simple assault prior to joshua's law
 
02:37:04.070 --> 02:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
passing in new hampshire and modifying
 
02:37:05.830 --> 02:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
173 b
 
02:37:08.070 --> 02:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
people were denied for that disqualifier
 
02:37:09.510 --> 02:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
02:37:11.990 --> 02:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
so this idea that they do not do
 
02:37:14.150 --> 02:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
research is completely false the reason
 
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
that there is a delay
 
02:37:18.309 --> 02:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
um sorry the reason that there's a
 
02:37:20.550 --> 02:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
possible response of delay instead of
 
02:37:22.630 --> 02:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
approve or deny is so that they can do
 
02:37:24.870 --> 02:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
that very research
 
02:37:27.750 --> 02:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
the the real issue um that
 
02:37:30.150 --> 02:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
no one has addressed thus far regarding
 
02:37:32.389 --> 02:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
the protection of victims is the fact
 
02:37:33.750 --> 02:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
that right now
 
02:37:36.790 --> 02:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
the state police yes for handguns
 
02:37:39.349 --> 02:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
they're maintaining some sort of sloppy
 
02:37:42.870 --> 02:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
paper copy or excel spreadsheet copy
 
02:37:45.030 --> 02:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
record of restraining orders but they're
 
02:37:46.870 --> 02:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
not sharing that information into the
 
02:37:48.550 --> 02:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
knicks index
 
02:37:50.389 --> 02:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of states and i
 
02:37:53.110 --> 02:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
included the map in my written testimony
 
02:37:55.349 --> 02:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of states do not use a
 
02:37:57.270 --> 02:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
point of contact system
 
02:37:59.590 --> 02:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
what they do is they're allowed by
 
02:38:02.710 --> 02:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
federal law to upload state prohibitors
 
02:38:05.110 --> 02:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
into the next indices
 
02:38:07.510 --> 02:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
so the nix indices is basically the
 
02:38:09.830 --> 02:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
catch-all for any prohibitor information
 
02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
that a state
 
02:38:13.270 --> 02:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
wants to enter
 
02:38:16.469 --> 02:38:16.479 align:start position:0%
separate and apart from ncic or the
 
02:38:19.670 --> 02:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
i database all you need to enter
 
02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
a state prohibitor into that database is
 
02:38:24.790 --> 02:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
the name and the date of birth or the
 
02:38:27.030 --> 02:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
name and the social security number
 
02:38:29.670 --> 02:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
now that list of 50 to 70 individuals
 
02:38:31.830 --> 02:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
without a date of birth that is entirely
 
02:38:34.550 --> 02:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
useless and this idea that oh the date
 
02:38:36.710 --> 02:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
of birth may not be known because it
 
02:38:38.870 --> 02:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
could be a stalking issue well those
 
02:38:40.710 --> 02:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
restraining orders don't go into effect
 
02:38:42.710 --> 02:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
until they're served on the person and
 
02:38:45.110 --> 02:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
if the police are serving the person
 
02:38:47.510 --> 02:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
they know that person's date of birth so
 
02:38:49.590 --> 02:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
it's another just example of sloppy
 
02:38:51.510 --> 02:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
record keeping
 
02:38:56.309 --> 02:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
ours that our state statute rsa 159 d1
 
02:38:58.950 --> 02:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
it simply allows nick's or sorry simply
 
02:39:01.030 --> 02:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
allows the gun line to be
 
02:39:03.030 --> 02:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
the point of contact for next that's the
 
02:39:05.429 --> 02:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
intermediary nick still runs the
 
02:39:07.910 --> 02:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
background checks there's absolutely
 
02:39:10.309 --> 02:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
zero state authority and the gun line
 
02:39:13.030 --> 02:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
does not operate under any agency rules
 
02:39:15.270 --> 02:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
allowing them to do off-the-cuff
 
02:39:17.270 --> 02:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
determinations regarding whether someone
 
02:39:19.429 --> 02:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
is a prohibited person or not
 
02:39:21.670 --> 02:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
in current the current system given the
 
02:39:24.230 --> 02:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
fact that they're not sharing
 
02:39:28.230 --> 02:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
restraining order information into necks
 
02:39:30.950 --> 02:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
they may they may uh block someone from
 
02:39:32.550 --> 02:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
buying a hand
 
02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:33.349 align:start position:0%
buying a hand
uh

02:39:33.349 --> 02:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:39:35.590 --> 02:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me this uh training list i'd like
 
02:39:37.590 --> 02:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
to actually suspend one moment you
 
02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you were then you were
 
02:39:40.630 --> 02:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
present with a jim
 
02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh mccloud who's also signed to testify
 
02:39:45.910 --> 02:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh because the timing did expire but if
 
02:39:47.429 --> 02:39:47.439 align:start position:0%
you are together
 
02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh if mr mclaughlin is gonna
 
02:39:52.389 --> 02:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh mcgraw is to yield his time to you i
 
02:39:57.349 --> 02:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:07.110 --> 02:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:09.910 --> 02:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
so mr mcleod will yield uh yields his
 
02:40:12.389 --> 02:40:12.399 align:start position:0%
time um so that i can continue
 
02:40:14.469 --> 02:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
testifying particularly in light of
 
02:40:16.630 --> 02:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
attorney head testifying for more than
 
02:40:18.309 --> 02:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
10 minutes and i'm trying to respond to
 
02:40:19.750 --> 02:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
it um
 
02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:20.870 align:start position:0%
it um
so

02:40:20.870 --> 02:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:40:23.270 --> 02:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure where it cut out
 
02:40:25.510 --> 02:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
but the point i was making is
 
02:40:28.150 --> 02:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
our state statute specifically permits
 
02:40:29.990 --> 02:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
the state tax as a point of contact it
 
02:40:31.510 --> 02:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
does not permit it to do all these
 
02:40:32.950 --> 02:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
additional checks they don't have any
 
02:40:35.830 --> 02:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
authority to do that but the state could
 
02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
be just putting that information into
 
02:40:37.680 --> 02:40:38.630 align:start position:0%
be just putting that information into
nics

02:40:38.630 --> 02:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
nics
 
02:40:38.640 --> 02:40:39.830 align:start position:0%
nics
so

02:40:39.830 --> 02:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:40:41.429 --> 02:40:41.439 align:start position:0%
people who have active restraining
 
02:40:43.750 --> 02:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
orders against them
 
02:40:45.429 --> 02:40:45.439 align:start position:0%
they also would be prohibited from
 
02:40:48.150 --> 02:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
buying shotguns put a different way
 
02:40:48.160 --> 02:40:49.510 align:start position:0%
buying shotguns put a different way
currently

02:40:49.510 --> 02:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:40:51.670 --> 02:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
they may block someone who's got an
 
02:40:53.110 --> 02:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
active restraining order against them
 
02:40:55.429 --> 02:40:55.439 align:start position:0%
from buying a handgun that same person
 
02:40:57.910 --> 02:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
could go buy a shotgun or an ar-15
 
02:40:59.830 --> 02:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that the department
 
02:41:01.670 --> 02:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
of safety does not upload that
 
02:41:04.150 --> 02:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
information into next
 
02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:05.110 align:start position:0%
information into next
now

02:41:05.110 --> 02:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:41:07.190 --> 02:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
the gun line uses the excuse that the
 
02:41:09.670 --> 02:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
delays are because of an influx and an
 
02:41:11.510 --> 02:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
increase in calls
 
02:41:14.950 --> 02:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
there was a 71 increase on the federal
 
02:41:17.429 --> 02:41:17.439 align:start position:0%
level that nick's experienced it went
 
02:41:17.439 --> 02:41:18.230 align:start position:0%
level that nick's experienced it went
from

02:41:18.230 --> 02:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:20.230 align:start position:0%
from
um

02:41:20.230 --> 02:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm getting an echo there it went
 
02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:23.270 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm getting an echo there it went
from

02:41:23.270 --> 02:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:41:27.750 --> 02:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
just over 28 million checks in 2019 to
 
02:41:32.230 --> 02:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
39 million 695 000 in 2020 and guess
 
02:41:35.190 --> 02:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
what nick's kept up with it
 
02:41:37.590 --> 02:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
the issue that we're seeing with the gun
 
02:41:39.270 --> 02:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
line is the fact that
 
02:41:41.590 --> 02:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
frankly we are allowing people second
 
02:41:45.030 --> 02:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
amendment rights to be held at bay
 
02:41:47.349 --> 02:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
at you know at the leisure bureaucratic
 
02:41:47.359 --> 02:41:48.469 align:start position:0%
at you know at the leisure bureaucratic
whim

02:41:48.469 --> 02:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
whim
 
02:41:50.070 --> 02:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
for example
 
02:41:52.870 --> 02:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
i represent individuals who
 
02:41:55.110 --> 02:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
appeal denials of firearm transfers on
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
both the state and the federal level the
 
02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
gun line is supposed to follow federal
 
02:42:03.670 --> 02:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
law which requires specifically that
 
02:42:06.230 --> 02:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
within five days of a written appeal
 
02:42:08.469 --> 02:42:08.479 align:start position:0%
they provide a reason that someone's
 
02:42:11.429 --> 02:42:11.439 align:start position:0%
been denied they simply don't do that so
 
02:42:13.030 --> 02:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that they don't even they
 
02:42:15.830 --> 02:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
don't even follow federal law makes it
 
02:42:17.750 --> 02:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
very hard to accept the idea that
 
02:42:19.990 --> 02:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to follow some agency
 
02:42:23.429 --> 02:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
principles or agency policy in place
 
02:42:25.510 --> 02:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
what's further concerning is the fact
 
02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:26.710 align:start position:0%
what's further concerning is the fact
that

02:42:26.710 --> 02:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:42:28.710 --> 02:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
these federal background checks they're
 
02:42:30.630 --> 02:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
supposed to be done in accordance with
 
02:42:33.990 --> 02:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
very specific regulations you know 28
 
02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:34.990 align:start position:0%
very specific regulations you know 28
cfr

02:42:34.990 --> 02:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
cfr
 
02:42:37.510 --> 02:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
25.5 and six
 
02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
and very specific statutes what we're
 
02:42:42.230 --> 02:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
basically being told is that the gun
 
02:42:44.150 --> 02:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
line is taking it upon itself to do all
 
02:42:46.150 --> 02:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
these extra checks that neither the
 
02:42:48.469 --> 02:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
legislature or the department of safety
 
02:42:50.870 --> 02:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
through rule making has set the
 
02:42:52.230 --> 02:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
framework for
 
02:42:52.240 --> 02:42:53.190 align:start position:0%
framework for
and

02:42:53.190 --> 02:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:42:54.550 --> 02:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to affect people's
 
02:42:56.550 --> 02:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights kind of behind the
 
02:42:56.560 --> 02:42:57.830 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights kind of behind the
curtain

02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
curtain
 
02:43:00.550 --> 02:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
in the last year i saw people who had
 
02:43:03.429 --> 02:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
guns taken away from them in court
 
02:43:03.439 --> 02:43:04.389 align:start position:0%
guns taken away from them in court
that

02:43:04.389 --> 02:43:04.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:43:05.910 --> 02:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
even if
 
02:43:07.670 --> 02:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
there was a restraining order that was
 
02:43:09.990 --> 02:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
temporary three days it expired they
 
02:43:12.710 --> 02:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
couldn't get it back for 10 11 months
 
02:43:15.190 --> 02:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
there was a crisis going on at the court
 
02:43:17.510 --> 02:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
level they were totally log jammed and
 
02:43:20.150 --> 02:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
by the way right now there is no way for
 
02:43:22.070 --> 02:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
a person who's wrongfully denied the
 
02:43:24.550 --> 02:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
return of firearms to appeal it senate
 
02:43:27.030 --> 02:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
bill 141 fixes that
 
02:43:29.910 --> 02:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
it requires a very specific time frame
 
02:43:32.070 --> 02:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
for the checks to be run
 
02:43:34.710 --> 02:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
and also for it gives appeal rights for
 
02:43:38.150 --> 02:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
individuals who are wrongfully denied
 
02:43:39.990 --> 02:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
also let me make the point about
 
02:43:42.870 --> 02:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
downshifting to the sheriff's office
 
02:43:44.790 --> 02:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of background checks
 
02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
that occur in the state
 
02:43:49.429 --> 02:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
of the gun line are handgun purchases
 
02:43:52.150 --> 02:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
the uh return of firearms in court
 
02:43:54.070 --> 02:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's a secondary function
 
02:43:55.590 --> 02:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
that's actually something that was
 
02:43:58.870 --> 02:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
created by protocol 11 by the court
 
02:44:01.670 --> 02:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
system not even by statute
 
02:44:05.269 --> 02:44:05.279 align:start position:0%
and that's only about 400 to 450 checks
 
02:44:08.389 --> 02:44:08.399 align:start position:0%
a year over all 10 counties according to
 
02:44:08.399 --> 02:44:09.269 align:start position:0%
a year over all 10 counties according to
the

02:44:09.269 --> 02:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:44:12.309 --> 02:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
chief circuit court judge
 
02:44:14.070 --> 02:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
these background checks for purposes of
 
02:44:16.469 --> 02:44:16.479 align:start position:0%
the return of firearms are simple
 
02:44:18.950 --> 02:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
so simple that the next system is
 
02:44:20.469 --> 02:44:20.479 align:start position:0%
currently being used by police
 
02:44:22.550 --> 02:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
departments all over the state to issue
 
02:44:24.710 --> 02:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
licenses to carry and they don't even
 
02:44:27.269 --> 02:44:27.279 align:start position:0%
get additional funding to do that
 
02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
so this idea that it's going to be some
 
02:44:31.590 --> 02:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
02:44:33.990 --> 02:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
some arduous undertaking or it's going
 
02:44:37.670 --> 02:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
to require significant funding is false
 
02:44:40.550 --> 02:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
i just want to make the point that
 
02:44:42.790 --> 02:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
as it currently stands what we're doing
 
02:44:44.389 --> 02:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
is we are spending hundreds of thousands
 
02:44:46.389 --> 02:44:46.399 align:start position:0%
of dollars a year
 
02:44:48.630 --> 02:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
on a system that just adds an extra
 
02:44:51.030 --> 02:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
layer of government bureaucracy when the
 
02:44:52.550 --> 02:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
federal system
 
02:44:55.030 --> 02:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
works all over the country
 
02:44:57.030 --> 02:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
states that have piles of state
 
02:44:58.830 --> 02:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
prohibitors like new york in
 
02:45:01.990 --> 02:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
massachusetts they use only the feds
 
02:45:05.190 --> 02:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
what we have here is a situation where
 
02:45:07.269 --> 02:45:07.279 align:start position:0%
the department of safety does not want
 
02:45:09.030 --> 02:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
to update its own records so that the
 
02:45:10.950 --> 02:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate information is going into
 
02:45:15.269 --> 02:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
nyx which would not only allow people to
 
02:45:17.190 --> 02:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
enjoy the second amendment rights but it
 
02:45:19.190 --> 02:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
would protect victims of domestic
 
02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:20.870 align:start position:0%
would protect victims of domestic
violence

02:45:20.870 --> 02:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
violence
 
02:45:22.630 --> 02:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to take
 
02:45:26.830 --> 02:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:29.110 --> 02:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
frankly go ahead
 
02:45:30.710 --> 02:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
02:45:32.389 --> 02:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
uh the chair recognizes representative
 
02:45:35.190 --> 02:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
panther lockus to ask a question
 
02:45:37.030 --> 02:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:45:38.870 --> 02:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you sean for taking my
 
02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:40.550 align:start position:0%
and thank you sean for taking my
question

02:45:40.550 --> 02:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:45:42.710 --> 02:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
i would like you to give me
 
02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:45.030 align:start position:0%
i would like you to give me
um

02:45:45.030 --> 02:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:47.830 --> 02:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
some reasons why you believe
 
02:45:49.830 --> 02:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
that this is better
 
02:45:52.790 --> 02:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
at the county level than at the state
 
02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:54.550 align:start position:0%
at the county level than at the state
level

02:45:54.550 --> 02:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:45:56.389 --> 02:45:56.399 align:start position:0%
sure so
 
02:45:59.670 --> 02:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
so basically as far as the uh return of
 
02:46:02.710 --> 02:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
firearms in court that that limited
 
02:46:04.230 --> 02:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
function that would be served by the
 
02:46:05.990 --> 02:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
sheriff's office
 
02:46:07.910 --> 02:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
the reason that i think this would be
 
02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
better is number one
 
02:46:11.910 --> 02:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
sheriff's offices they are the only
 
02:46:14.070 --> 02:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
constitutionally created police agency
 
02:46:15.269 --> 02:46:15.279 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
02:46:17.590 --> 02:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
they have regular interaction with the
 
02:46:18.870 --> 02:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
court system
 
02:46:21.590 --> 02:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
and frankly they do a lot of functions
 
02:46:24.309 --> 02:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
outside of what uh officers learn in the
 
02:46:26.790 --> 02:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
police academy so like right now they
 
02:46:28.710 --> 02:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
serve civil process
 
02:46:32.550 --> 02:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
right and they carry on functions uh
 
02:46:34.389 --> 02:46:34.399 align:start position:0%
in unison with the court system
 
02:46:34.399 --> 02:46:35.670 align:start position:0%
in unison with the court system
regularly

02:46:35.670 --> 02:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
regularly
 
02:46:37.429 --> 02:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
so having them
 
02:46:38.790 --> 02:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
in the court
 
02:46:41.110 --> 02:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
directly accountable to the court system
 
02:46:43.510 --> 02:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
to judges a judge could frankly ask you
 
02:46:45.429 --> 02:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
know the sheriff's office
 
02:46:48.150 --> 02:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
so when can we expect a response on that
 
02:46:49.830 --> 02:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
firearm related background check and
 
02:46:52.950 --> 02:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
they're right there so um i think it's
 
02:46:54.950 --> 02:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's just makes sense to change it from
 
02:46:56.309 --> 02:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
the department of safety given the
 
02:46:58.550 --> 02:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
issues but the sheriff's office seemed
 
02:47:02.469 --> 02:47:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:06.389 --> 02:47:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:08.150 --> 02:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a question thank
 
02:47:11.110 --> 02:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and uh thank you uh
 
02:47:14.550 --> 02:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:16.950 --> 02:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
i was hoping to hear
 
02:47:19.190 --> 02:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
from the owner of shooters and i do
 
02:47:22.710 --> 02:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
apologize that you had to use his time
 
02:47:24.710 --> 02:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
you know to finish your talk
 
02:47:26.550 --> 02:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
but i was
 
02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:28.150 align:start position:0%
but i was
wondering

02:47:28.150 --> 02:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
02:47:30.790 --> 02:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
you know what is the impact on gun
 
02:47:34.309 --> 02:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
buyers and owners with these delays that
 
02:47:36.870 --> 02:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
have happened in the past and that may
 
02:47:40.230 --> 02:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:42.630 --> 02:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
so that's a that's a great question it's
 
02:47:45.190 --> 02:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
been a significant issue so i represent
 
02:47:48.150 --> 02:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
gun dealers all over the state and um
 
02:47:49.670 --> 02:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know shooters outpost and jim
 
02:47:51.830 --> 02:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
mccloud they're the biggest gun dealer
 
02:47:54.070 --> 02:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
in the state and what i can tell you is
 
02:47:55.990 --> 02:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
is that the delays caused by the gun
 
02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:56.950 align:start position:0%
is that the delays caused by the gun
line

02:47:56.950 --> 02:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:47:59.349 --> 02:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
they have you know led to situations
 
02:47:59.359 --> 02:48:00.230 align:start position:0%
they have you know led to situations
where

02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:48:03.590 --> 02:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
firearms are just sitting not on the
 
02:48:05.750 --> 02:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
shelves available for purchase
 
02:48:08.150 --> 02:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
um sitting waiting for the state to come
 
02:48:10.150 --> 02:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
back to them and
 
02:48:12.309 --> 02:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
the issue is is that there's only so
 
02:48:15.110 --> 02:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
much inventory that smaller shops can
 
02:48:18.070 --> 02:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
can carry at any given time and having
 
02:48:20.150 --> 02:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
it tied up they haven't received payment
 
02:48:22.230 --> 02:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
for it there was a real economic
 
02:48:25.110 --> 02:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
disadvantage that they suffered and the
 
02:48:27.349 --> 02:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
delays you know someone asked earlier
 
02:48:30.150 --> 02:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
why is it that the delays are occurring
 
02:48:31.429 --> 02:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
02:48:33.349 --> 02:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
being someone that's
 
02:48:36.230 --> 02:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
in litigation depose the gun line
 
02:48:37.269 --> 02:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
folks and
 
02:48:39.349 --> 02:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
notably we don't actually ever hear from
 
02:48:41.190 --> 02:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
the gun line people that run the checks
 
02:48:43.830 --> 02:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
i can tell you there's a fundamental
 
02:48:45.510 --> 02:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding of the prohibited
 
02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:46.790 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding of the prohibited
categories

02:48:46.790 --> 02:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
categories
 
02:48:50.950 --> 02:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
and frankly um understaffing over there
 
02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:52.070 align:start position:0%
and frankly um understaffing over there
and

02:48:52.070 --> 02:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:48:54.070 --> 02:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
just one other point to answer your
 
02:48:54.080 --> 02:48:55.030 align:start position:0%
just one other point to answer your
question

02:48:55.030 --> 02:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:48:55.040 --> 02:48:55.910 align:start position:0%
question
um

02:48:55.910 --> 02:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:58.150 --> 02:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
the delays are also frequently caused by
 
02:48:58.160 --> 02:48:59.269 align:start position:0%
the delays are also frequently caused by
this

02:48:59.269 --> 02:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:49:01.670 --> 02:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
50 to 70 person list where there's no
 
02:49:03.910 --> 02:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
date of birth because that's not enough
 
02:49:06.070 --> 02:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
to block someone
 
02:49:07.910 --> 02:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
who's prohibited but it certainly is
 
02:49:10.309 --> 02:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
enough to delay someone who shares the
 
02:49:15.349 --> 02:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:17.269 --> 02:49:17.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative
 
02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a follow-up
 
02:49:21.510 --> 02:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman and thank
 
02:49:24.950 --> 02:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:28.870 --> 02:49:28.880 align:start position:0%

02:49:53.110 --> 02:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:59.269 --> 02:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:01.830 --> 02:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state police when they do
 
02:50:03.590 --> 02:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
their knicks background checks on
 
02:50:06.630 --> 02:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
handguns will have to follow that rule
 
02:50:09.269 --> 02:50:09.279 align:start position:0%
that law
 
02:50:11.670 --> 02:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely correct and i would
 
02:50:14.710 --> 02:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
suggest um that you know
 
02:50:16.950 --> 02:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
if if other attorneys who don't practice
 
02:50:18.309 --> 02:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
in gun law want to understand this
 
02:50:20.309 --> 02:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
interplay better that they take my
 
02:50:22.469 --> 02:50:22.479 align:start position:0%
continuing legal education course that i
 
02:50:24.550 --> 02:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
teach the lawyers i'm doing it in june
 
02:50:26.309 --> 02:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
what i can say about
 
02:50:29.590 --> 02:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
federal gun law is that it it is
 
02:50:31.750 --> 02:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh preemptive and
 
02:50:34.150 --> 02:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
holds supremacy over state law that's by
 
02:50:35.750 --> 02:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
article 5 of the united states
 
02:50:38.790 --> 02:50:38.800 align:start position:0%

02:53:44.469 --> 02:53:44.479 align:start position:0%
representative knight
 
02:53:45.990 --> 02:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
your hand is raised again do you wish to
 
02:53:47.670 --> 02:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
ask another question
 
02:53:51.429 --> 02:53:51.439 align:start position:0%
yes please mr chair and thank you
 
02:53:54.309 --> 02:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
so uh my understanding now that i just
 
02:53:56.070 --> 02:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
heard you speak is that you represent
 
02:53:58.309 --> 02:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
people that do sell firearms your
 
02:54:01.269 --> 02:54:01.279 align:start position:0%
clients directly will gain more money if
 
02:54:04.630 --> 02:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass correct
 
02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure if they'll gain more
 
02:54:07.990 --> 02:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
money or not that's definitely a
 
02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:09.590 align:start position:0%
money or not that's definitely a
possibility

02:54:09.590 --> 02:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
02:54:11.990 --> 02:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
i represent both dealers and i represent
 
02:54:14.469 --> 02:54:14.479 align:start position:0%
individuals so i do
 
02:54:17.030 --> 02:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
appeals involving denials of firearm
 
02:54:19.190 --> 02:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
transfers for individuals on both the
 
02:54:21.670 --> 02:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
state and federal level as well
 
02:54:21.680 --> 02:54:23.429 align:start position:0%
state and federal level as well
ultimately

02:54:23.429 --> 02:54:23.439 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
02:54:24.550 --> 02:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
02:54:27.030 --> 02:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
the gun line it going away because it
 
02:54:29.190 --> 02:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
causes so many problems and i have to
 
02:54:30.950 --> 02:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
threaten to sue them to get them to
 
02:54:33.110 --> 02:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
answer so frequently
 
02:54:35.269 --> 02:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill and and actually
 
02:54:37.590 --> 02:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
i'm the drafter of this bill with
 
02:54:39.830 --> 02:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
senator gaida um
 
02:54:41.910 --> 02:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know this bill will actually hurt my
 
02:54:44.550 --> 02:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
bottom line
 
02:54:46.950 --> 02:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
because you know then there won't be as
 
02:54:50.550 --> 02:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
many cases dealing with the gun line
 
02:54:51.750 --> 02:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's funny
 
02:54:55.200 --> 02:54:55.210 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:55.210 --> 02:54:58.950 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:54:58.950 --> 02:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:00.550 --> 02:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
we should be recognized for a question
 
02:55:03.670 --> 02:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman thank you
 
02:55:06.230 --> 02:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
for this question uh part six of the
 
02:55:08.950 --> 02:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
bill uh references uh
 
02:55:10.630 --> 02:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh immunity to the sheriff's point
 
02:55:14.469 --> 02:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:23.349 --> 02:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:25.030 --> 02:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative wallace you kind of faded
 
02:55:26.150 --> 02:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
out there at the end but i think i
 
02:55:27.670 --> 02:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
caught the whole question
 
02:55:30.150 --> 02:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
so the inclusion of that immunity
 
02:55:32.389 --> 02:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
provision regarding the sheriff's
 
02:55:34.309 --> 02:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
offices carrying out their duties under
 
02:55:36.790 --> 02:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
the chapter was was
 
02:55:38.389 --> 02:55:38.399 align:start position:0%
added after
 
02:55:40.550 --> 02:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
um you know they had raised concerns
 
02:55:45.190 --> 02:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
about possible legal liability etc uh
 
02:55:47.190 --> 02:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
the you know the immunity as far as the
 
02:55:49.990 --> 02:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
sheriff's offices go
 
02:55:52.710 --> 02:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
it really won't have an impact on
 
02:55:52.720 --> 02:55:53.990 align:start position:0%
it really won't have an impact on
individual

02:55:53.990 --> 02:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:55:55.910 --> 02:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
rights because of the fact that there is
 
02:55:59.750 --> 02:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
such a well-defined appeal process so
 
02:55:59.760 --> 02:56:00.550 align:start position:0%
such a well-defined appeal process so
the

02:56:00.550 --> 02:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:56:00.560 --> 02:56:02.389 align:start position:0%
the
the

02:56:02.389 --> 02:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:56:04.230 --> 02:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
checks for the return of firearms have
 
02:56:06.070 --> 02:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
to happen within they have to be
 
02:56:08.150 --> 02:56:08.160 align:start position:0%

a neutral position on this bill
 
02:57:16.630 --> 02:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
we met with senator guida and worked
 
02:57:18.070 --> 02:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
with him to craft some amendments to the
 
02:57:19.830 --> 02:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
bill when it was introduced into the
 
02:57:21.990 --> 02:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
senate however there is an outstanding
 
02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:23.269 align:start position:0%
senate however there is an outstanding
concern

02:57:23.269 --> 02:57:23.279 align:start position:0%

we respectfully ask that you make the

2 b on page 2 of the bill
 
02:57:34.309 --> 02:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
you'll see in that section that it
 
02:57:36.550 --> 02:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
refers to when the the
 
02:57:39.110 --> 02:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
motion is filed with the court
 
02:57:41.590 --> 02:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
and the time clock begins to run i'll
 
02:57:43.830 --> 02:57:43.840 align:start position:0%

other pleading requests in the return of
 
02:57:51.760 --> 02:57:53.510 align:start position:0%
other pleading requests in the return of
firearms

02:57:53.510 --> 02:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
firearms
 
02:57:55.990 --> 02:57:56.000 align:start position:0%

02:58:01.110 --> 02:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
with receiving

02:58:11.429 --> 02:58:11.439 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:58:13.990 --> 02:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
we'd request again that the data filing
 
02:58:16.070 --> 02:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
of the motion be re
 
02:58:22.389 --> 02:58:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:23.429 --> 02:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
the only other concern that the
 
02:58:26.070 --> 02:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
sheriff's association and it's been
 
02:58:26.080 --> 02:58:27.110 align:start position:0%
sheriff's association and it's been
addressed

02:58:27.110 --> 02:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
02:58:29.030 --> 02:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
quite a bit already is the cost that's
 
02:58:31.349 --> 02:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
associated with it sheriff's association
 
02:58:33.590 --> 02:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
is not sure what the cost
 
02:58:34.710 --> 02:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:58:37.830 --> 02:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
involving these checks um i'm aware of
 
02:58:40.070 --> 02:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
one county which would be co-ops county
 
02:58:41.830 --> 02:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
that does not have the hardware to to
 
02:58:44.309 --> 02:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
accomplish this um they depend on other
 
02:58:45.990 --> 02:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement agencies to run
 
02:58:47.590 --> 02:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
their checks for them
 
02:58:47.600 --> 02:58:48.389 align:start position:0%
their checks for them
so

02:58:48.389 --> 02:58:48.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:58:49.990 --> 02:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
and i know that this has been discussed
 
02:58:51.910 --> 02:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
and it's uh senator guida brought it up
 
02:58:53.670 --> 02:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
in his opening
 
02:58:56.309 --> 02:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
regarding being able to use a six-month
 
02:59:00.950 --> 02:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:02.630 --> 02:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
all 10 sheriff's office will be required
 
02:59:04.230 --> 02:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
to train personnel regarding submitting
 
02:59:05.349 --> 02:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
receiving and receiving mixed
 
02:59:06.870 --> 02:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
information as well as the state and
 
02:59:08.309 --> 02:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines as they relate to the
 
02:59:09.830 --> 02:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
possession of firearms by prohibited
 
02:59:09.840 --> 02:59:10.790 align:start position:0%
possession of firearms by prohibited
persons

02:59:10.790 --> 02:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
persons
 
02:59:12.870 --> 02:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
additionally all 10 sheriffs are not in
 
02:59:14.550 --> 02:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
positions to absorb the commitment that
 
02:59:16.070 --> 02:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
will be required with the personnel they
 
02:59:18.070 --> 02:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
currently have on staff
 
02:59:19.510 --> 02:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
these are the issues that the uh the
 
02:59:21.190 --> 02:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
sheriff's association are bringing
 
02:59:21.200 --> 02:59:21.990 align:start position:0%
sheriff's association are bringing
forward

02:59:21.990 --> 02:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:59:24.389 --> 02:59:24.399 align:start position:0%
um again we have uh we've we've
 
02:59:25.990 --> 02:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
attempted to to address this with
 
02:59:28.469 --> 02:59:28.479 align:start position:0%
senator geider in the onset and they
 
02:59:31.510 --> 02:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
still remain unresolved
 
02:59:33.269 --> 02:59:33.279 align:start position:0%
i'd be thank you i'd like to thank you
 
02:59:34.710 --> 02:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
for your time and entertain any
 
02:59:37.990 --> 02:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
questions if the committee has any
 
02:59:39.590 --> 02:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
karen recognizes representative
 
02:59:42.469 --> 02:59:42.479 align:start position:0%
pantalafest to ask a question
 
02:59:45.429 --> 02:59:45.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i would like to
 
02:59:47.510 --> 02:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
ask the question if the
 
02:59:51.030 --> 02:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
sheriff has an estimated number of
 
02:59:56.389 --> 02:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:58.150 --> 02:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
03:00:00.150 --> 03:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
we're unaware we're told that there's
 
03:00:02.870 --> 03:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
between four to 500 of these checks that
 
03:00:05.670 --> 03:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
occur on an annual basis um being from
 
03:00:07.269 --> 03:00:07.279 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county being the largest
 
03:00:09.429 --> 03:00:09.439 align:start position:0%
county uh i have to make an assumption
 
03:00:11.750 --> 03:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
that this county would probably receive
 
03:00:13.110 --> 03:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
the most
 
03:00:18.150 --> 03:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
inquiries for the return of firearms um
 
03:00:20.150 --> 03:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
the information that's been provided you
 
03:00:22.150 --> 03:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
from other testifying
 
03:00:24.070 --> 03:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
individuals is that it takes a short
 
03:00:25.910 --> 03:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
period of time to run it that is correct
 
03:00:27.590 --> 03:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
um we run it in through the database
 
03:00:29.750 --> 03:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
which we we do on a regular basis for
 
03:00:32.070 --> 03:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
other things um
 
03:00:33.750 --> 03:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
it would probably be done by our
 
03:00:36.070 --> 03:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
communications personnel with that being
 
03:00:38.790 --> 03:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
said it would be an additional
 
03:00:40.309 --> 03:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
burden that would be placed on top of
 
03:00:42.309 --> 03:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
what they're already doing
 
03:00:44.630 --> 03:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
so to say that we would need to
 
03:00:46.309 --> 03:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
hire an additional dispatch or an
 
03:00:48.790 --> 03:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
additional clerk that is unknown at this
 
03:00:48.800 --> 03:00:50.150 align:start position:0%
additional clerk that is unknown at this
point

03:00:50.150 --> 03:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:00:52.469 --> 03:00:52.479 align:start position:0%
we're not in a position to be able to to
 
03:00:55.670 --> 03:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
to say whether or not that would occur
 
03:00:59.990 --> 03:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:02.070 --> 03:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
signal for the hands raised i want to
 
03:01:04.230 --> 03:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
thank the sheriff for his testimony
 
03:01:08.230 --> 03:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:10.469 --> 03:01:10.479 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair recognizes kenny
 
03:01:10.479 --> 03:01:11.670 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair recognizes kenny
dean

03:01:11.670 --> 03:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
dean
 
03:01:13.110 --> 03:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
it's a reminder testimony will be
 
03:01:15.510 --> 03:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
limited to three minutes
 
03:01:17.429 --> 03:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um
 
03:01:19.349 --> 03:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
my name is penny dean i live in concord
 
03:01:20.469 --> 03:01:20.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
03:01:22.630 --> 03:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
i'm an attorney i've been licensed over
 
03:01:24.950 --> 03:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
20 years i'm licensed in maine new
 
03:01:27.190 --> 03:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire massachusetts d.c circuit
 
03:01:28.950 --> 03:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
admitted to the federal courts and the
 
03:01:30.790 --> 03:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
first circuit court of appeals in those
 
03:01:32.950 --> 03:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
areas as well as the united states
 
03:01:34.389 --> 03:01:34.399 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
03:01:36.230 --> 03:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
and i won't take all the committee's
 
03:01:38.550 --> 03:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
time with my firearm certifications but
 
03:01:40.550 --> 03:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
i am a hunter education instructor a
 
03:01:42.309 --> 03:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
pistol instructor and i have several
 
03:01:43.990 --> 03:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
other credentials
 
03:01:46.790 --> 03:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
but what's most important to me here as
 
03:01:50.230 --> 03:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
a gun owner is this bill is poorly
 
03:01:50.240 --> 03:01:52.150 align:start position:0%
a gun owner is this bill is poorly
drafted

03:01:52.150 --> 03:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
03:01:55.110 --> 03:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
in exhibits in every shape and form and
 
03:01:57.269 --> 03:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
i certainly can't outline them all a
 
03:02:00.070 --> 03:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
fundamental misunderstanding of how the
 
03:02:02.790 --> 03:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
courts work and how firearms work
 
03:02:05.349 --> 03:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
as far as how firearm checks works and
 
03:02:07.510 --> 03:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
first of all my torts professor would
 
03:02:09.990 --> 03:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
say back up the money truck and here's
 
03:02:12.150 --> 03:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
what i can tell you as an attorney if
 
03:02:14.230 --> 03:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
this bill passes i'm going to make
 
03:02:16.389 --> 03:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
multiples of the money i make now
 
03:02:18.230 --> 03:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
and here is why
 
03:02:21.349 --> 03:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
if a person is denied a handgun
 
03:02:23.510 --> 03:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
they get a denial number i send a
 
03:02:25.910 --> 03:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
release to the gun line usually within
 
03:02:28.230 --> 03:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
hours but certainly within 24 hours and
 
03:02:30.230 --> 03:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
at most maybe a couple days usually
 
03:02:32.230 --> 03:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
within a day a few hours the new
 
03:02:34.790 --> 03:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire state police gun line tells me
 
03:02:37.190 --> 03:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
why the person was denied they told me
 
03:02:39.510 --> 03:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
the court the denial was in they tell me
 
03:02:41.510 --> 03:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
the date of the denial
 
03:02:43.190 --> 03:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
they tell me the docket number of the
 
03:02:45.190 --> 03:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
denial and they tell me the specific
 
03:02:46.870 --> 03:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
statute the person is alleged to have
 
03:02:46.880 --> 03:02:47.990 align:start position:0%
statute the person is alleged to have
violated

03:02:47.990 --> 03:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
violated
 
03:02:49.910 --> 03:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
that means all i have to do is go to the
 
03:02:52.550 --> 03:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
court and see if that is a disqualifier
 
03:02:54.469 --> 03:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
see if it is my client
 
03:02:57.269 --> 03:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
and it becomes a very simple exercise in
 
03:02:59.030 --> 03:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
either saying yes this is my client we
 
03:03:01.030 --> 03:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
have to get it annulled no it isn't my
 
03:03:03.190 --> 03:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
client or no it's not disqualifying it's
 
03:03:05.750 --> 03:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
very simple when i give the new
 
03:03:07.269 --> 03:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire state police gun line that
 
03:03:07.279 --> 03:03:08.389 align:start position:0%
hampshire state police gun line that
information

03:03:08.389 --> 03:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:03:11.190 --> 03:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
usually within hours but i don't recall
 
03:03:13.269 --> 03:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
it ever being more than a day although
 
03:03:15.110 --> 03:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
it might have been they have an answer
 
03:03:16.389 --> 03:03:16.399 align:start position:0%
back for me
 
03:03:17.349 --> 03:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
and they
 
03:03:19.190 --> 03:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
and it's i bring them certified records
 
03:03:20.870 --> 03:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
and the answer is of course your client
 
03:03:22.710 --> 03:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
is now allowed to purchase a firearm
 
03:03:24.309 --> 03:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
because i don't bring them junk
 
03:03:24.319 --> 03:03:25.750 align:start position:0%
because i don't bring them junk
information

03:03:25.750 --> 03:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:03:25.760 --> 03:03:26.790 align:start position:0%
information
now

03:03:26.790 --> 03:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:03:29.269 --> 03:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
if you go to fbi nics
 
03:03:31.750 --> 03:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
and ask them you can literally be
 
03:03:34.150 --> 03:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
waiting years and i call the circular
 
03:03:36.950 --> 03:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
file you send them or the client asks
 
03:03:38.070 --> 03:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
them why
 
03:03:40.150 --> 03:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
and they will send you back a response
 
03:03:42.070 --> 03:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
well you or someone like you may have
 
03:03:42.080 --> 03:03:43.190 align:start position:0%
well you or someone like you may have
been

03:03:43.190 --> 03:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:03:45.190 --> 03:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
charged and convicted of something that
 
03:03:46.710 --> 03:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
bars you from firearms and lists the
 
03:03:49.190 --> 03:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate statutes that doesn't tell a
 
03:03:51.190 --> 03:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
person how to fix it it doesn't tell
 
03:03:53.030 --> 03:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
them what court it doesn't tell them
 
03:03:55.190 --> 03:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
anything there's no way a person will
 
03:03:57.110 --> 03:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
ever be able to buy a gun through the
 
03:03:59.990 --> 03:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
next system with those type of answers
 
03:04:01.910 --> 03:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
and i sent out to the committee and i'm
 
03:04:03.349 --> 03:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
happy to send the committee these
 
03:04:05.269 --> 03:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
samples of these letters
 
03:04:07.510 --> 03:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's like a circular thing it is a
 
03:04:09.910 --> 03:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
horrible horrible thing for a gun owner
 
03:04:12.150 --> 03:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
fbi nix denies people their second
 
03:04:14.790 --> 03:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
amendment rights every day of the week
 
03:04:17.110 --> 03:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
and it's just an exercise in futility
 
03:04:20.469 --> 03:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
and those who hire me to do that spend
 
03:04:22.550 --> 03:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
tons of money people who go through the
 
03:04:25.269 --> 03:04:25.279 align:start position:0%
gun line spend a small fraction and get
 
03:04:27.110 --> 03:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
their issues addressed literally in
 
03:04:29.030 --> 03:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
hours if not days
 
03:04:31.110 --> 03:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
so anyone that tells you
 
03:04:32.950 --> 03:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
that that's not the case i've been doing
 
03:04:34.710 --> 03:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
this for over 20 years and it certainly
 
03:04:36.630 --> 03:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
is the case the gun line
 
03:04:39.030 --> 03:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
is really a protector of new hampshire
 
03:04:41.429 --> 03:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
citizens second amendment rights
 
03:04:43.510 --> 03:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
but more importantly if this bill was to
 
03:04:46.070 --> 03:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
pass it's missing so many provisions
 
03:04:47.670 --> 03:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
again i wouldn't have time to tell you
 
03:04:47.680 --> 03:04:48.710 align:start position:0%
again i wouldn't have time to tell you
about

03:04:48.710 --> 03:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:04:51.510 --> 03:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
one of the provisions says
 
03:04:54.150 --> 03:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
talks about an appeal well how many days
 
03:04:55.670 --> 03:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
do you have to appeal to the supreme
 
03:04:57.830 --> 03:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
court show me where that is in the bill
 
03:04:59.110 --> 03:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
it's not there
 
03:05:01.990 --> 03:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
there's all these mechanical provisions
 
03:05:05.349 --> 03:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
that are necessary when enacting a bill
 
03:05:07.990 --> 03:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
they're simply missing from this bill
 
03:05:10.950 --> 03:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
and i think that's a huge problem the
 
03:05:12.710 --> 03:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
other problem they've talked about is
 
03:05:14.630 --> 03:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
for example in this bill
 
03:05:16.389 --> 03:05:16.399 align:start position:0%
a person's firearms are taken but they
 
03:05:18.309 --> 03:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
can still have ammunition and ammunition
 
03:05:21.349 --> 03:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
components that's pretty interesting
 
03:05:23.030 --> 03:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's not how it works under federal
 
03:05:25.670 --> 03:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
law but this bill simply doesn't address
 
03:05:28.070 --> 03:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of those issues
 
03:05:30.950 --> 03:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
but the other issue is they talk about
 
03:05:33.830 --> 03:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
this 24 hours person's going to get
 
03:05:36.150 --> 03:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
updates of any modification or
 
03:05:39.429 --> 03:05:39.439 align:start position:0%
dismissals modification or dismissal
 
03:05:41.110 --> 03:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
prohibiting firearms ownership and this
 
03:05:43.750 --> 03:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
is all found on page 3 of 5.
 
03:05:45.830 --> 03:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
but what if someone actually looks at
 
03:05:47.030 --> 03:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:05:50.309 --> 03:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
you look at it and say wait a minute
 
03:05:52.790 --> 03:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
the courts are not mandated it says the
 
03:05:55.590 --> 03:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
court will update nics
 
03:05:57.190 --> 03:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
why doesn't
 
03:05:58.830 --> 03:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
03:06:02.550 --> 03:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
the the court it doesn't say the court
 
03:06:04.870 --> 03:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
shall update nick's
 
03:06:07.910 --> 03:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
it also gives them 24 out
 
03:06:11.429 --> 03:06:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:25.030 --> 03:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:29.190 --> 03:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you um
 
03:06:30.870 --> 03:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
for your
 
03:06:33.190 --> 03:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
03:06:36.469 --> 03:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
mrs dean i would like you to go through
 
03:06:39.510 --> 03:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
for safety reasons for my new hampshire
 
03:06:41.670 --> 03:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
residents if we were to amend this bill
 
03:06:43.910 --> 03:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
and fix it what are some of the other
 
03:06:47.510 --> 03:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:48.790 --> 03:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
i have a whole bunch and i'd
 
03:06:50.870 --> 03:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
respectfully say that this should be
 
03:06:53.590 --> 03:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
itled i'm i'm absolutely opposed to the
 
03:06:55.830 --> 03:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
bill because no matter how many fixes
 
03:06:57.269 --> 03:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
you put
 
03:06:59.590 --> 03:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
you can't or at least no one that i know
 
03:07:02.870 --> 03:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
can control those in washington dc
 
03:07:04.950 --> 03:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is if we have a problem
 
03:07:06.950 --> 03:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
now with this we can pick up the phone
 
03:07:08.870 --> 03:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
and go talk to the gun line we can walk
 
03:07:11.190 --> 03:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
into the gun line you can't do that with
 
03:07:14.389 --> 03:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
fbi nics you can't call a person who's a
 
03:07:16.309 --> 03:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
decision maker you can't walk into their
 
03:07:16.319 --> 03:07:17.269 align:start position:0%
decision maker you can't walk into their
office

03:07:17.269 --> 03:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
office
 
03:07:19.429 --> 03:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
so if you start in the beginning to fix
 
03:07:20.790 --> 03:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:07:23.429 --> 03:07:23.439 align:start position:0%
the first place that i would fix the
 
03:07:23.439 --> 03:07:24.710 align:start position:0%
the first place that i would fix the
bill

03:07:24.710 --> 03:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:07:26.230 --> 03:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:07:26.240 --> 03:07:27.750 align:start position:0%
is that
um

03:07:27.750 --> 03:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:30.710 --> 03:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
which is page 2 and i don't have the
 
03:07:32.870 --> 03:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
line numbers because i looked at the
 
03:07:35.110 --> 03:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
sections it would be section
 
03:07:35.120 --> 03:07:37.590 align:start position:0%
sections it would be section
3

03:07:37.590 --> 03:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:41.349 --> 03:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
roman or i'm sorry the 1596 d1
 
03:07:43.990 --> 03:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
roman 1 number c
 
03:07:45.750 --> 03:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
nothing in this chapter shall be
 
03:07:48.230 --> 03:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
construed to limit prevent or impose
 
03:07:50.070 --> 03:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
background check requirements on the
 
03:07:50.080 --> 03:07:52.309 align:start position:0%
background check requirements on the
private

03:07:52.309 --> 03:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
private
 
03:07:54.550 --> 03:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
transfer of firearms not otherwise
 
03:07:58.790 --> 03:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
prohibited that is an open door to allow
 
03:08:00.710 --> 03:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
private background checks that is just
 
03:08:03.349 --> 03:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
poorly worded and i am a person who is
 
03:08:05.670 --> 03:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to private background checks
 
03:08:07.910 --> 03:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
meaning if there's sale private sale of
 
03:08:09.750 --> 03:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
firearms i'm opposed to that background
 
03:08:12.710 --> 03:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
check this is an open door for that
 
03:08:14.389 --> 03:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
so that's one thing i think would have
 
03:08:16.070 --> 03:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
to be fixed
 
03:08:18.230 --> 03:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
next um
 
03:08:21.030 --> 03:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
what about civil proceedings they have a
 
03:08:23.510 --> 03:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
process there for those whose firearm
 
03:08:25.429 --> 03:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
was taken again this is in the same

criminal proceedings what about any
 
03:08:42.309 --> 03:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
other civil proceedings if you're
 
03:08:43.830 --> 03:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
involved in any of those other civil
 
03:08:45.830 --> 03:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
proceedings and your firearm is taken
 
03:08:47.830 --> 03:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
away i guess you don't get it back
 
03:08:50.309 --> 03:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
because there's no process here it's not
 
03:08:52.790 --> 03:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
listed in here and any judge is going to
 
03:08:55.110 --> 03:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
say to you the legislature means what it
 
03:08:57.269 --> 03:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
says and says what it means if they
 
03:08:59.429 --> 03:08:59.439 align:start position:0%
didn't put it in there it's not covered
 
03:09:02.550 --> 03:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
and i can't do anything about it
 
03:09:02.560 --> 03:09:04.950 align:start position:0%
and i can't do anything about it
next

03:09:04.950 --> 03:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
next
 
03:09:07.269 --> 03:09:07.279 align:start position:0%

c
 
03:09:13.110 --> 03:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
if the county sheriff's office
 
03:09:14.630 --> 03:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
determines that an individual is
 
03:09:17.030 --> 03:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
prohibited from owning or possessing it
 
03:09:20.389 --> 03:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
says the specific facts relied upon
 
03:09:23.510 --> 03:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
the specific facts are useless
 
03:09:26.550 --> 03:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
you need a docket number
 
03:09:28.710 --> 03:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
you need a court
 
03:09:32.230 --> 03:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
you need a citation
 
03:09:34.550 --> 03:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
and you need the why
 
03:09:36.150 --> 03:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
those are the things right now the gun
 
03:09:38.150 --> 03:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
line hands you on a silver platter
 
03:09:40.309 --> 03:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
virtually immediately
 
03:09:42.630 --> 03:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
that giving that basic information
 
03:09:44.630 --> 03:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
should absolutely be required and again
 
03:09:46.389 --> 03:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
i can provide the committee form letters
 
03:09:47.830 --> 03:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
for years and years and years that the
 
03:09:50.150 --> 03:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
gun line gives those things
 
03:09:53.190 --> 03:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
and so why wouldn't that be required
 
03:09:55.750 --> 03:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
here those are very basic pieces of
 
03:09:55.760 --> 03:09:58.469 align:start position:0%
here those are very basic pieces of
information

03:09:58.469 --> 03:09:58.479 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:09:59.349 --> 03:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
if you
 
03:10:03.910 --> 03:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:03.920 --> 03:10:05.030 align:start position:0%
 
i

03:10:05.030 --> 03:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:10:07.670 --> 03:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
i certainly appreciate the
 
03:10:09.990 --> 03:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
detail of your testimony
 
03:10:12.550 --> 03:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
i understand several issues or concerns
 
03:10:14.710 --> 03:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
you have with this bill
 
03:10:16.070 --> 03:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
there are other questions and other
 
03:10:18.070 --> 03:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
members of the public presence and we
 
03:10:21.349 --> 03:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
are already behind schedule so
 
03:10:22.710 --> 03:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
do you have written testimony that you
 
03:10:24.150 --> 03:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
can provide to the committee do you have
 
03:10:25.190 --> 03:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
it already
 
03:10:26.950 --> 03:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
i don't have written testimony and i
 
03:10:28.870 --> 03:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
apologize i thought i was answering the
 
03:10:30.550 --> 03:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
representative's question so i didn't
 
03:10:33.910 --> 03:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
mean to go on i was going through it
 
03:10:35.910 --> 03:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
answering the question but i i
 
03:10:38.389 --> 03:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
from my understanding of your testimony
 
03:10:38.399 --> 03:10:52.630 align:start position:0%
from my understanding of your testimony
is

03:10:52.630 --> 03:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:55.190 --> 03:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
the questions
 
03:10:57.830 --> 03:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sorry do you want me to continue
 
03:10:59.269 --> 03:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
answering or waiting for a follow-up i
 
03:11:01.590 --> 03:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
didn't catch what you were saying sir
 
03:11:03.590 --> 03:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
if you may uh you may continue answering
 
03:11:05.110 --> 03:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
the questions i just sent them a
 
03:11:06.550 --> 03:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
reminder that we do have other members
 
03:11:17.470 --> 03:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:17.480 --> 03:11:21.429 align:start position:0%

03:11:23.349 --> 03:11:23.359 align:start position:0%
yes sir and i will
 
03:11:25.110 --> 03:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to answer every part of
 
03:11:27.510 --> 03:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
the defects because um the chairs ask me
 
03:11:29.110 --> 03:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
to be brief so i just want to let you
 
03:11:31.030 --> 03:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
know that i'm hitting the highlights but
 
03:11:33.030 --> 03:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
not all of the defects
 
03:11:36.630 --> 03:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
on page three of five the very first
 
03:11:39.510 --> 03:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
couple of lines which is essentially
 
03:11:42.230 --> 03:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
roman numeral two
 
03:11:42.240 --> 03:11:43.110 align:start position:0%

one two and three
 
03:11:47.190 --> 03:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
it says the expiration of a deadline for
 
03:11:49.269 --> 03:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
filing a petition or notice appeal in
 
03:11:51.269 --> 03:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
the trial court
 
03:11:54.070 --> 03:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
and they don't give
 
03:11:56.469 --> 03:11:56.479 align:start position:0%
specifics for example you file a rule 7
 
03:11:58.790 --> 03:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
notice of appeal in the supreme court
 
03:12:00.550 --> 03:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
but they're not giving you specific
 
03:12:02.630 --> 03:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
procedures and deadlines
 
03:12:05.429 --> 03:12:05.439 align:start position:0%
so they have some for times in the trial
 
03:12:05.439 --> 03:12:06.389 align:start position:0%
so they have some for times in the trial
court

03:12:06.389 --> 03:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
court
 
03:12:08.790 --> 03:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
but not in the supremes
 
03:12:11.349 --> 03:12:11.359 align:start position:0%
they talk about the appeals of denials
 
03:12:14.389 --> 03:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
in 159 d2 which is also on page three of
 
03:12:14.399 --> 03:12:15.510 align:start position:0%
in 159 d2 which is also on page three of
five

03:12:15.510 --> 03:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
five
 
03:12:17.269 --> 03:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
and you have a right to request a
 
03:12:19.429 --> 03:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
further hearing on the matter within 30
 
03:12:21.590 --> 03:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
days of the date of denial that's
 
03:12:23.750 --> 03:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
suggesting there was a first hearing
 
03:12:25.830 --> 03:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
when one says further hearing it
 
03:12:27.750 --> 03:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
suggests there was a hearing prior to
 
03:12:27.760 --> 03:12:28.630 align:start position:0%
suggests there was a hearing prior to
that

03:12:28.630 --> 03:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:12:31.030 --> 03:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't seem to be the case
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
unless they're talking about the hearing
 
03:12:35.110 --> 03:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
where you ask for the firearms to be
 
03:12:37.750 --> 03:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
returned pending a sheriff's department
 
03:12:37.760 --> 03:12:40.070 align:start position:0%
returned pending a sheriff's department
check

03:12:40.070 --> 03:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
check
 
03:12:43.910 --> 03:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
the next error that i find is like i
 
03:12:46.309 --> 03:12:46.319 align:start position:0%
said that it's in page three of five the
 
03:12:48.790 --> 03:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
ammunition or ammunition components used
 
03:12:51.349 --> 03:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
to be prohibited as well as firearms and
 
03:12:53.349 --> 03:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
now they seem to be allowed
 
03:12:56.230 --> 03:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
which is contrary to federal law
 
03:12:58.550 --> 03:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
but i guess we're gonna do things our
 
03:13:01.590 --> 03:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
own way here the other thing we have
 
03:13:04.230 --> 03:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
here is it's going to take at least 48
 
03:13:05.750 --> 03:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
hours for this to happen in some
 
03:13:08.870 --> 03:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
instances because the court has 24 hours
 
03:13:11.190 --> 03:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
if they follow the situation where they
 
03:13:12.790 --> 03:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
send it to the department of safety
 
03:13:15.190 --> 03:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
within 24 hours the department of safety
 
03:13:17.590 --> 03:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
then has 24 hours
 
03:13:19.750 --> 03:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
of receipt of this
 
03:13:22.710 --> 03:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
to upload it into nyx that's 48 hours
 
03:13:24.870 --> 03:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
but the other question is in certain
 
03:13:27.349 --> 03:13:27.359 align:start position:0%
instances does the legislature under
 
03:13:29.269 --> 03:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
separation of powers
 
03:13:32.710 --> 03:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
have the authority to mandate the courts
 
03:13:34.309 --> 03:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
let me ask the witness to suspend
 
03:13:35.670 --> 03:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
answering the question that that the
 
03:13:36.630 --> 03:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
answer is
 
03:13:39.030 --> 03:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
we do have to move along i do apologize
 
03:13:40.469 --> 03:13:40.479 align:start position:0%
if we have additional time i'll allow
 
03:13:42.229 --> 03:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
you to continue answering that question
 
03:13:43.590 --> 03:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
there's other members that also have
 
03:13:43.600 --> 03:13:44.710 align:start position:0%
there's other members that also have
questions

03:13:44.710 --> 03:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:13:46.309 --> 03:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
so i recognize representative burke for
 
03:13:48.550 --> 03:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
a question thank you mr chairman try to
 
03:13:50.309 --> 03:13:50.319 align:start position:0%
keep the question direct
 
03:13:51.750 --> 03:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
brief answer yep
 
03:13:56.150 --> 03:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:58.710 --> 03:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
over the last 20 years we have seen ups
 
03:14:00.070 --> 03:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
and downs
 
03:14:00.080 --> 03:14:01.590 align:start position:0%
and downs
with

03:14:01.590 --> 03:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:14:05.269 --> 03:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
the time it takes for a handgun to be
 
03:14:09.429 --> 03:14:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:12.710 --> 03:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
how are we going to fix the future
 
03:14:14.389 --> 03:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
ups and downs
 
03:14:16.870 --> 03:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
if we continue with the current system
 
03:14:18.710 --> 03:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
with the state police
 
03:14:20.070 --> 03:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
03:14:22.790 --> 03:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative here is what i personally
 
03:14:24.630 --> 03:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
believe i believe the state police had a
 
03:14:26.870 --> 03:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
rogue employee that was doing as they
 
03:14:29.349 --> 03:14:29.359 align:start position:0%
chose when they chose this guidance from
 
03:14:31.349 --> 03:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office that i
 
03:14:33.030 --> 03:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
believe is dated
 
03:14:34.790 --> 03:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
i want to say it's in january but i know
 
03:14:38.070 --> 03:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's of this year is very specific as to
 
03:14:39.830 --> 03:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
the checks how they're going to be
 
03:14:42.150 --> 03:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
conducted and what's going to be checked
 
03:14:44.150 --> 03:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
it has made a massive difference in
 
03:14:46.309 --> 03:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
what's done so i believe
 
03:14:48.469 --> 03:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
unless someone was going to suggest the
 
03:14:50.229 --> 03:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
employees just ignore the attorney
 
03:14:51.830 --> 03:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
general's guidance
 
03:14:54.469 --> 03:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
that things are fixed
 
03:14:56.309 --> 03:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
i've talked to dealer after dealer who
 
03:14:58.070 --> 03:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
tell me five to seven minutes is how
 
03:14:59.670 --> 03:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
long they're waiting for checks because
 
03:15:02.309 --> 03:15:02.319 align:start position:0%
i like everyone else calls the dealers
 
03:15:03.750 --> 03:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
so i believe
 
03:15:05.349 --> 03:15:05.359 align:start position:0%
that it is fixed they had a problem
 
03:15:07.269 --> 03:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
they've identified it they've got phone
 
03:15:09.429 --> 03:15:09.439 align:start position:0%
like rollover phone lines
 
03:15:11.349 --> 03:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
so i know we can't guarantee anything
 
03:15:13.110 --> 03:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
but i know people who wait longer on
 
03:15:13.120 --> 03:15:16.790 align:start position:0%
but i know people who wait longer on
nics

03:15:16.790 --> 03:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:18.550 --> 03:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
and i hope that's responsive i'm sorry i
 
03:15:20.229 --> 03:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody can guarantee
 
03:15:23.830 --> 03:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
anything with all due respect
 
03:15:23.840 --> 03:15:25.190 align:start position:0%
anything with all due respect
representative

03:15:25.190 --> 03:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:15:27.269 --> 03:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up question thank you and
 
03:15:27.279 --> 03:15:30.630 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up question thank you and
uh

03:15:30.630 --> 03:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:35.190 --> 03:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
you spoke on how it's easier to
 
03:15:36.870 --> 03:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
fix a
 
03:15:40.150 --> 03:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
denial of false denial in new hampshire
 
03:15:42.150 --> 03:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
can you explain because i'm hearing from
 
03:15:44.150 --> 03:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
the national groups that it's really
 
03:15:47.510 --> 03:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
easier to go to the feds and to
 
03:15:50.710 --> 03:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
fix this problem if you are um
 
03:15:52.469 --> 03:15:52.479 align:start position:0%
and can you you know explain how the
 
03:15:54.630 --> 03:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
feds are different from the new
 
03:15:54.640 --> 03:15:55.670 align:start position:0%
feds are different from the new
hampshire

03:15:55.670 --> 03:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:15:58.150 --> 03:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely and what i'm also going to do
 
03:16:00.309 --> 03:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
after i finish testifying representative
 
03:16:02.469 --> 03:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
is send the committee
 
03:16:05.349 --> 03:16:05.359 align:start position:0%
a bunch of redacted letters from both
 
03:16:07.990 --> 03:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
nyx and the state and the proof is in
 
03:16:10.150 --> 03:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
the pudding so let me walk through what
 
03:16:12.389 --> 03:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
happens when you do when you're denied
 
03:16:14.710 --> 03:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
by nics when you're denied by next if
 
03:16:17.510 --> 03:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
the person chooses to go online they can
 
03:16:20.070 --> 03:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
input their information into next and
 
03:16:22.630 --> 03:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
nix usually comes back and says we think
 
03:16:24.550 --> 03:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
your person is prohibited under federal
 
03:16:26.389 --> 03:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
law you have a name and or date of birth
 
03:16:28.389 --> 03:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
that's similar but we have to be sure
 
03:16:30.150 --> 03:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
it's you so oh by the way give us your
 
03:16:32.229 --> 03:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
fingerprints and so i'm thinking okay
 
03:16:34.070 --> 03:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
they were sure enough that it was him or
 
03:16:36.229 --> 03:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
her to deny them you don't need
 
03:16:38.150 --> 03:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
fingerprints for a passport don't need
 
03:16:40.150 --> 03:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
fingerprints for a driver's license but
 
03:16:41.030 --> 03:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to demand your
 
03:16:43.349 --> 03:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
fingerprints and they send you this
 
03:16:43.359 --> 03:16:44.790 align:start position:0%
fingerprints and they send you this
circular

03:16:44.790 --> 03:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
circular
 
03:16:46.710 --> 03:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
letters they'll send you the same letter
 
03:16:48.309 --> 03:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
ten times in a row
 
03:16:51.110 --> 03:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
but that will not tell you the court you
 
03:16:51.120 --> 03:16:52.550 align:start position:0%
but that will not tell you the court you
were

03:16:52.550 --> 03:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
were
 
03:16:54.950 --> 03:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
can allegedly convicted in
 
03:16:57.510 --> 03:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
the place you're allegedly convicted and
 
03:16:59.830 --> 03:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
why specifically why you're denied
 
03:17:01.590 --> 03:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
saying that you're denied under federal
 
03:17:03.670 --> 03:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
law because you may have been convicted
 
03:17:05.030 --> 03:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
of a crime for which you could have
 
03:17:07.110 --> 03:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
received more than one year imprisonment
 
03:17:09.269 --> 03:17:09.279 align:start position:0%
is not helpful it doesn't allow you to
 
03:17:11.269 --> 03:17:11.279 align:start position:0%
solve the problem i have one letter
 
03:17:13.190 --> 03:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's dated this year that i can send
 
03:17:15.110 --> 03:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
to the committee and here's what the
 
03:17:17.990 --> 03:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
letter from nick says even if you give
 
03:17:18.000 --> 03:17:19.110 align:start position:0%
letter from nick says even if you give
us

03:17:19.110 --> 03:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:17:21.990 --> 03:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
a criminal record check from the state
 
03:17:24.070 --> 03:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
this is from certified that says you
 
03:17:26.070 --> 03:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
have no record it's not good enough for
 
03:17:29.190 --> 03:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
us in this case they claim person x was
 
03:17:32.790 --> 03:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
arrested on this x date for crimex well
 
03:17:35.590 --> 03:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
person x has never been arrested ever
 
03:17:36.950 --> 03:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
for that crime
 
03:17:38.469 --> 03:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
never been convicted and they don't
 
03:17:40.309 --> 03:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
claim he was convicted they say he was
 
03:17:42.710 --> 03:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
arrested it's impossible to prove a
 
03:17:44.710 --> 03:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
negative i have another letter that said
 
03:17:46.469 --> 03:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
we think you were committed to a mental
 
03:17:46.479 --> 03:17:48.229 align:start position:0%
we think you were committed to a mental
institution

03:17:48.229 --> 03:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
institution
 
03:17:49.830 --> 03:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
if they think that they should be able
 
03:17:52.150 --> 03:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
to tell you the date the city and the
 
03:17:54.630 --> 03:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
mental institution but if you ask me
 
03:17:57.110 --> 03:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
today to prove that i wasn't arrested in
 
03:17:59.670 --> 03:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
kansas city i can't prove a negative not
 
03:18:03.510 --> 03:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
by their standard they will not accept
 
03:18:06.950 --> 03:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
even an uh state police clear record
 
03:18:08.950 --> 03:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
there's no reasoning with him it comes
 
03:18:11.030 --> 03:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
back to when my mother said you can't
 
03:18:13.190 --> 03:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
have a cookie and i said why because i'm
 
03:18:15.830 --> 03:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
the mother and i said so that's how fbi
 
03:18:18.070 --> 03:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
nicks operates they simply won't give
 
03:18:21.349 --> 03:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
you an answer and without an answer
 
03:18:22.550 --> 03:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
you're never going to be able to buy a
 
03:18:22.560 --> 03:18:23.830 align:start position:0%
you're never going to be able to buy a
gun

03:18:23.830 --> 03:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
gun
 
03:18:25.750 --> 03:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
because they won't tell you why
 
03:18:27.590 --> 03:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
they didn't say in concord district
 
03:18:32.150 --> 03:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
court in june 1944 docket number abc123
 
03:18:34.389 --> 03:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
you're convicted of violating rsi blah
 
03:18:36.950 --> 03:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
blah blah that's a reason that the gun
 
03:18:38.630 --> 03:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
line's going to give you and you can
 
03:18:40.630 --> 03:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
debate it
 
03:18:42.469 --> 03:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
nix will never do that
 
03:18:47.670 --> 03:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:49.110 --> 03:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
03:18:50.469 --> 03:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
uh we're not gonna organize any more
 
03:18:51.830 --> 03:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
questions with the witness and the
 
03:18:53.320 --> 03:18:53.330 align:start position:0%
witness is excused

answered on behalf of my constituents

moving along i believe that that's also
 
03:20:17.429 --> 03:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
in the interest of the public

the witness that previously testified is
 
03:20:22.150 --> 03:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
very easily accessible if there's any
 
03:20:23.670 --> 03:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
information you wish to get from her i'm
 
03:20:25.590 --> 03:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
sure she's more than willing
 
03:20:26.790 --> 03:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
to uh

that this uh that will also be present

the following year

executing this bill that we should be
 
03:20:38.870 --> 03:20:38.880 align:start position:0%

opposition to sb 141 which would
 
03:21:09.429 --> 03:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
eliminate the state's gun line and place
 
03:21:11.349 --> 03:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
victims of domestic violence and
 
03:21:13.030 --> 03:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
stalking at a heightened risk of lethal
 
03:21:14.870 --> 03:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
assault in new hampshire thank you so
 
03:21:16.630 --> 03:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
much for the opportune opportunity to
 
03:21:18.389 --> 03:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
testify today
 
03:21:20.309 --> 03:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's gun line as you've heard
 
03:21:22.229 --> 03:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
serves as a state background
 
03:21:24.309 --> 03:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm so sorry backup registry
 
03:21:25.750 --> 03:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
allowing law enforcement in new
 
03:21:27.510 --> 03:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire to conduct criminal background
 
03:21:29.030 --> 03:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
checks when individuals attempt to
 
03:21:31.990 --> 03:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
purchase firearms or petition for return
 
03:21:33.750 --> 03:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
of firearms after they have been legally
 
03:21:35.510 --> 03:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
relinquished due to domestic or sexual
 
03:21:37.750 --> 03:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
violence incidents domestic violence
 
03:21:39.349 --> 03:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
offenders are the most likely to murder
 
03:21:41.269 --> 03:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
someone in the state so this system is
 
03:21:43.590 --> 03:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
crucial to protect the lives of victims
 
03:21:45.269 --> 03:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
this system has been in place for over
 
03:21:47.269 --> 03:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
20 years and there are new hampshire
 
03:21:49.110 --> 03:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
specific public safety concerns that
 
03:21:51.190 --> 03:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed before we eliminate
 
03:21:53.030 --> 03:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
the gun line and shift entirely to the
 
03:21:55.349 --> 03:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
federal system i also want to reiterate
 
03:21:56.790 --> 03:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns addressed by the
 
03:21:58.309 --> 03:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
department of safety and the courts and
 
03:22:00.630 --> 03:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
their testimony which we share
 
03:22:02.229 --> 03:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
the transition from the department of
 
03:22:03.750 --> 03:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
safety to the fbi will take a
 
03:22:05.510 --> 03:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of careful planning
 
03:22:07.670 --> 03:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
and coordination where all necessary
 
03:22:09.910 --> 03:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders are engaged in this process
 
03:22:11.750 --> 03:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
this conversation has not yet taken
 
03:22:13.510 --> 03:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
place and has not been confirmed whether
 
03:22:15.670 --> 03:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
or not the fbi can fully transfer new
 
03:22:17.190 --> 03:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire's gun line into the federal
 
03:22:19.190 --> 03:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
system which i think you've heard so far
 
03:22:20.469 --> 03:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
03:22:21.990 --> 03:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
this means that we are gambling with the
 
03:22:24.469 --> 03:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
lives of victims specifically i want to
 
03:22:26.870 --> 03:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
highlight that as written this bill does
 
03:22:28.790 --> 03:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
not ensure the same level of protections
 
03:22:30.710 --> 03:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
currently afforded victims of domestic
 
03:22:31.990 --> 03:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
violence and stalking under new
 
03:22:34.229 --> 03:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire law as you heard from previous
 
03:22:36.150 --> 03:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
witnesses this bill does not include all
 
03:22:37.830 --> 03:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
types of protective orders currently
 
03:22:39.590 --> 03:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
included in the gun line
 
03:22:41.349 --> 03:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
and only authorizes
 
03:22:43.269 --> 03:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
very specific protective orders under
 
03:22:48.469 --> 03:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
173b and 6333 it excludes criminal bill
 
03:22:50.469 --> 03:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
protective orders and
 
03:22:52.550 --> 03:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
child protection protective orders under
 
03:22:54.630 --> 03:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
the child protection act which is a very
 
03:22:57.670 --> 03:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
serious thing to exclude additionally
 
03:22:59.269 --> 03:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
the nyx system would not search the
 
03:23:01.190 --> 03:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
emergency domestic violence orders and
 
03:23:03.110 --> 03:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
criminal bill protective orders issued
 
03:23:05.349 --> 03:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
after hours further limiting the state's
 
03:23:07.670 --> 03:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
ability to adequately respond and ensure
 
03:23:10.150 --> 03:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
that violent offenders are not able
 
03:23:11.670 --> 03:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
to access
 
03:23:13.110 --> 03:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
deadly weapons
 
03:23:15.910 --> 03:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
secondly you heard about the issue with
 
03:23:17.990 --> 03:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
um productive orders that do not have
 
03:23:19.910 --> 03:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
the date of birth so i won't go into
 
03:23:21.349 --> 03:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
detail on that but i'd be happy to
 
03:23:23.190 --> 03:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
answer further questions if clarity is
 
03:23:25.190 --> 03:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
needed but without the gun line there
 
03:23:27.510 --> 03:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
will always be approximately 50 to 70
 
03:23:29.190 --> 03:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
people with the ability to purchase a
 
03:23:31.269 --> 03:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
firearm that are legally prohibited from
 
03:23:32.550 --> 03:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
doing so
 
03:23:34.630 --> 03:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
in conclusion while shifting background
 
03:23:35.910 --> 03:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
check management to the federal
 
03:23:38.229 --> 03:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
government could work someday the proper
 
03:23:40.150 --> 03:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
work and planning has not been done and
 
03:23:41.830 --> 03:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
if the current legislation were to pass
 
03:23:43.990 --> 03:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
there could be lethal consequences due
 
03:23:45.510 --> 03:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
to the serious concerns we have
 
03:23:47.910 --> 03:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
regarding victim safety we are asking if
 
03:23:49.990 --> 03:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
you would please consider voting itl on
 
03:23:51.750 --> 03:23:51.760 align:start position:0%

03:23:55.750 --> 03:23:55.760 align:start position:0%

representative wallace was the time
 
03:24:19.110 --> 03:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:20.790 --> 03:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
will someone else take that responsible
 
03:24:20.800 --> 03:24:22.309 align:start position:0%
will someone else take that responsible
representative

03:24:22.309 --> 03:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:24:30.070 --> 03:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:32.469 --> 03:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:24:36.389 --> 03:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
um uh miss miss keelig um could you go
 
03:24:39.030 --> 03:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
back into your testimony and
 
03:24:42.309 --> 03:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry could you just reiterate and
 
03:24:45.750 --> 03:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
clarify the 50 to 70
 
03:24:45.760 --> 03:24:49.030 align:start position:0%
clarify the 50 to 70
um

03:24:49.030 --> 03:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:51.190 --> 03:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
restraining orders or protective orders
 
03:24:53.510 --> 03:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
that would be missed by this what would
 
03:24:56.389 --> 03:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
be the effect for those um
 
03:24:58.229 --> 03:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
people who had taken out those
 
03:25:00.229 --> 03:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
restraining orders or protective orders
 
03:25:03.110 --> 03:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
that would be missed by this process
 
03:25:04.710 --> 03:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so much for your question
 
03:25:07.510 --> 03:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
this was uh what both commissioner quinn
 
03:25:08.950 --> 03:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
and richard head from the courts were
 
03:25:11.349 --> 03:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
highlighting regarding the
 
03:25:13.429 --> 03:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
cases where a victim filed a protective
 
03:25:14.790 --> 03:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
order but does not know the date of
 
03:25:17.110 --> 03:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
birth of the defendant um so that is
 
03:25:19.590 --> 03:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
that gap that they highlighted where
 
03:25:22.870 --> 03:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
they're between being able to file and
 
03:25:24.790 --> 03:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh get granted for the protective order
 
03:25:26.950 --> 03:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
and then getting this protective order
 
03:25:29.349 --> 03:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
served to the defendant the that without
 
03:25:31.510 --> 03:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
that date of birth it would not be
 
03:25:34.550 --> 03:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
entered into the nick system um so this
 
03:25:34.560 --> 03:25:35.269 align:start position:0%
entered into the nick system um so this
is

03:25:35.269 --> 03:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:25:38.630 --> 03:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
that 50 to 70 people are on average um
 
03:25:40.229 --> 03:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
the than the amount of folks that would
 
03:25:43.670 --> 03:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
be missed um in that gap um so who could
 
03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
legally um get a firearm even though
 
03:25:49.190 --> 03:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:51.590 --> 03:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
i have a follow-up mr chair
 
03:25:51.600 --> 03:25:52.469 align:start position:0%
i have a follow-up mr chair
senator

03:25:52.469 --> 03:25:52.479 align:start position:0%

question

03:26:08.070 --> 03:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
increase in gun sales
 
03:26:09.670 --> 03:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
um as a
 
03:26:11.429 --> 03:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
representative from the new hampshire
 
03:26:13.510 --> 03:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
coalition against domestic and sexual
 
03:26:13.520 --> 03:26:15.110 align:start position:0%
coalition against domestic and sexual
violence

03:26:15.110 --> 03:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
violence

can you speak to an increase in gun
 
03:26:20.950 --> 03:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
related domestic and sexual violence
 
03:26:22.870 --> 03:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so much for the question i

don't have any current data but i will
 
03:26:28.150 --> 03:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
say from the 2018-2019
 
03:26:30.710 --> 03:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh domestic violence fatality review
 
03:26:33.750 --> 03:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
report that came out in october 2020 um
 
03:26:36.389 --> 03:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
we know that they're about
 
03:26:40.150 --> 03:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
40 40 to 50 percent of homicides in the
 
03:26:41.510 --> 03:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire are domestic
 
03:26:43.429 --> 03:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
violence related so domestic violence is
 
03:26:45.349 --> 03:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
a factor in those homicides
 
03:26:47.670 --> 03:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
and we also know that firearms account
 
03:26:49.990 --> 03:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
for about 50 percent of the causes of
 
03:26:53.030 --> 03:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
domestic violence homicides um so it is
 
03:26:55.110 --> 03:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
a significant concern
 
03:26:57.110 --> 03:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
and that is why victim safety should be
 
03:26:58.790 --> 03:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
really central and considered when we
 
03:26:59.910 --> 03:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
are talking about changing our
 
03:27:06.550 --> 03:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:08.150 --> 03:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
seeing you for the hands raised i want
 
03:27:17.269 --> 03:27:17.279 align:start position:0%

03:27:54.150 --> 03:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
hank handguns and the experience that i
 
03:27:54.160 --> 03:27:55.030 align:start position:0%
hank handguns and the experience that i
had

03:27:55.030 --> 03:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
had
 
03:27:57.510 --> 03:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
with buying a particular handgun
 
03:27:59.910 --> 03:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
um i have no reason to be
 
03:28:01.910 --> 03:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
denied or delayed or anything of that
 
03:28:03.910 --> 03:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
nature from any sort of you know
 
03:28:05.590 --> 03:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
criminal or civil basis
 
03:28:07.670 --> 03:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know clean record in that regard
 
03:28:10.710 --> 03:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
and went to go buy a handgun wherein
 
03:28:12.469 --> 03:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
i experienced a
 
03:28:14.309 --> 03:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
five week
 
03:28:14.319 --> 03:28:15.510 align:start position:0%
five week
delay

03:28:15.510 --> 03:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
delay
 
03:28:17.190 --> 03:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
from the gun line on a particular
 
03:28:19.510 --> 03:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
handgun and this was actually i had
 
03:28:19.520 --> 03:28:20.229 align:start position:0%
handgun and this was actually i had
bought

03:28:20.229 --> 03:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
bought
 
03:28:21.510 --> 03:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
more than one over the course of a
 
03:28:23.510 --> 03:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
particular year
 
03:28:25.510 --> 03:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
so this this was a follow-up that i had
 
03:28:27.750 --> 03:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
bought and this particular gun was a
 
03:28:30.790 --> 03:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
single shot uh 380 little obscure you
 
03:28:34.389 --> 03:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
know uh firearm but the the fact is that
 
03:28:36.309 --> 03:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
had i had mal intent and been trying to
 
03:28:38.150 --> 03:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
do something harmful i would have been
 
03:28:39.750 --> 03:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
better served going to a home depot and
 
03:28:41.590 --> 03:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
getting a hammer frankly at that point
 
03:28:44.309 --> 03:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
but the fact that i had a a five-week
 
03:28:45.590 --> 03:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
delay i think
 
03:28:47.030 --> 03:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
just for this and i've bought firearms
 
03:28:50.229 --> 03:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
both before and since um and and seeing
 
03:28:51.830 --> 03:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
what's what's wrong really with this
 
03:28:51.840 --> 03:28:52.790 align:start position:0%
what's what's wrong really with this
system

03:28:52.790 --> 03:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:28:55.110 --> 03:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
shows that you know frankly i would
 
03:28:56.710 --> 03:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
think about abolishing it even if it
 
03:28:59.269 --> 03:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
were free but the fact that it also
 
03:29:01.910 --> 03:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
costs the state taxpayers money i think
 
03:29:04.309 --> 03:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
it's just egregious and i'd like to go
 
03:29:08.870 --> 03:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:10.550 --> 03:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the channel
 
03:29:11.990 --> 03:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
recognized representative plan knight
 
03:29:13.750 --> 03:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
03:29:15.670 --> 03:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you sir for taking
 
03:29:18.870 --> 03:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
my question um so if you had firearms
 
03:29:22.550 --> 03:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
already in your home this wasn't a need
 
03:29:27.670 --> 03:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:29.670 --> 03:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
i mean first of all the fact that it was
 
03:29:32.950 --> 03:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
a uh a single shot 380 as i mentioned
 
03:29:36.229 --> 03:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
shows that again it's it it's
 
03:29:37.910 --> 03:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
not really the lethal force of the tool
 
03:29:40.469 --> 03:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
that was of concern i think the
 
03:29:42.070 --> 03:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
the bigger concern is with the fact that
 
03:29:42.080 --> 03:29:42.790 align:start position:0%
the bigger concern is with the fact that
they're

03:29:42.790 --> 03:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
they're
 
03:29:44.630 --> 03:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
you know what's the justification for
 
03:29:47.349 --> 03:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
that five-week delay um you know given
 
03:29:49.030 --> 03:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned there's there's no other
 
03:29:51.190 --> 03:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
reason uh for delaying me and there
 
03:29:52.710 --> 03:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
hadn't been prior or
 
03:29:58.950 --> 03:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:00.229 --> 03:30:00.239 align:start position:0%

03:33:50.150 --> 03:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
a clerk would take the information and
 
03:33:52.550 --> 03:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
say we'll call you back and the callback
 
03:33:56.070 --> 03:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
comes anywhere from 15 minutes to
 
03:33:59.670 --> 03:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
days weeks and in some cases months
 
03:34:01.830 --> 03:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
we have heard over the years the state
 
03:34:04.229 --> 03:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
police have tried to fix it
 
03:34:07.110 --> 03:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
the fix works for a short period of time
 
03:34:09.830 --> 03:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
and things revert to the old ways
 
03:34:11.590 --> 03:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
the purpose of me submitting these
 
03:34:11.600 --> 03:34:13.349 align:start position:0%
the purpose of me submitting these
comments

03:34:13.349 --> 03:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
comments
 
03:34:15.429 --> 03:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
is for this committee to hear from
 
03:34:17.030 --> 03:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
regular members of the public who have
 
03:34:19.110 --> 03:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
been burdened and inconvenienced and
 
03:34:21.030 --> 03:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
deprived of their second amendment
 
03:34:21.040 --> 03:34:21.990 align:start position:0%
deprived of their second amendment
rights

03:34:21.990 --> 03:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
rights
 
03:34:24.710 --> 03:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
because of these delays at the gun line
 
03:34:27.830 --> 03:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
enough is enough is enough
 
03:34:29.670 --> 03:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
this committee should vote senate bill
 
03:34:29.680 --> 03:34:31.110 align:start position:0%
this committee should vote senate bill
141

03:34:31.110 --> 03:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
141
 
03:34:32.710 --> 03:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
03:34:35.590 --> 03:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
as submitted to you by the senate they
 
03:34:37.349 --> 03:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
heard the testimony they heard the
 
03:34:39.190 --> 03:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
concerns of the sheriffs they addressed
 
03:34:42.150 --> 03:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
the concerns and amended the bill it's
 
03:34:50.389 --> 03:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:54.070 --> 03:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:55.590 --> 03:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative burke
 
03:34:56.790 --> 03:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
03:34:58.870 --> 03:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
03:35:02.950 --> 03:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:04.790 --> 03:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
could you explain
 
03:35:08.150 --> 03:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
if a person is denied if
 
03:35:10.550 --> 03:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
we only use nics
 
03:35:13.030 --> 03:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
and not the new hampshire state police
 
03:35:15.110 --> 03:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
how hard is it to
 
03:35:18.389 --> 03:35:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:18.399 --> 03:35:19.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:35:19.910 --> 03:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:35:22.070 --> 03:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
working for a national firearms
 
03:35:24.630 --> 03:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
organization i have the ability to speak
 
03:35:27.510 --> 03:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
with people across the country
 
03:35:29.990 --> 03:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
and as you have heard the vast majority
 
03:35:31.349 --> 03:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
of states
 
03:35:33.670 --> 03:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
go through the fbi they do not use a
 
03:35:35.670 --> 03:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
state point of contact
 
03:35:37.429 --> 03:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
and when i talk to lawyers in these
 
03:35:41.110 --> 03:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
states they tell me it is very easy
 
03:35:43.670 --> 03:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
to appeal a next denial i'm not a lawyer
 
03:35:45.349 --> 03:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
i've never represented people so i
 
03:35:46.870 --> 03:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
haven't done it
 
03:35:49.110 --> 03:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
but i go by what the attorneys tell me
 
03:35:51.190 --> 03:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
and they tell me it's extremely easy in
 
03:35:53.110 --> 03:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
many cases a person can do it on their
 
03:35:55.269 --> 03:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
own they don't need an attorney
 
03:35:57.429 --> 03:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
but yet in new hampshire the system is
 
03:36:00.150 --> 03:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
so burdened and so complex
 
03:36:02.469 --> 03:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
the person does need an attorney
 
03:36:03.750 --> 03:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
03:36:05.190 --> 03:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
some of the attorneys who spoke here
 
03:36:07.030 --> 03:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
earlier or somebody completely different
 
03:36:09.510 --> 03:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
but they need an attorney it's a complex
 
03:36:11.510 --> 03:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
labyrinth system and it's extremely
 
03:36:11.520 --> 03:36:12.630 align:start position:0%
labyrinth system and it's extremely
difficult

03:36:12.630 --> 03:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
03:36:14.150 --> 03:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
where the federal system is very
 
03:36:15.830 --> 03:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
clinical it's on the numbers and a lot
 
03:36:18.150 --> 03:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
of it's done by mail
 
03:36:20.630 --> 03:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
and it's usually handled in a very very
 
03:36:24.710 --> 03:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:27.269 --> 03:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
just a small follow-up mr chairman
 
03:36:29.190 --> 03:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
recognized for a small follow-up thank
 
03:36:30.790 --> 03:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
03:36:34.790 --> 03:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:36.389 --> 03:36:36.399 align:start position:0%
with the current system with the new
 
03:36:38.550 --> 03:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire state police doing backgrounds
 
03:36:40.229 --> 03:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
through nics
 
03:36:40.239 --> 03:36:41.030 align:start position:0%
through nics
what

03:36:41.030 --> 03:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:36:42.150 --> 03:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
are there
 
03:36:44.550 --> 03:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
any benefits to the
 
03:36:46.790 --> 03:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire resident or business for
 
03:36:48.469 --> 03:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
03:36:50.710 --> 03:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
we we don't see any benefit on the
 
03:36:50.720 --> 03:36:52.790 align:start position:0%
we we don't see any benefit on the
initial

03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
initial
 
03:36:54.870 --> 03:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
system in new hampshire was designed as
 
03:36:57.750 --> 03:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
an intermittent or an interval system
 
03:36:59.510 --> 03:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
when the brady weight
 
03:37:03.590 --> 03:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
in the mid 1990s required a gun buyer a
 
03:37:05.590 --> 03:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
handgun only buyer
 
03:37:06.630 --> 03:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
to wait
 
03:37:09.190 --> 03:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
five days between purchase and delivery
 
03:37:11.830 --> 03:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
of a handgun from a licensed dealer and
 
03:37:13.750 --> 03:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
the only way to avoid the five-day
 
03:37:16.550 --> 03:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
weight was if the state of residence
 
03:37:18.550 --> 03:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
had some sort of a permit license or
 
03:37:18.560 --> 03:37:19.590 align:start position:0%
had some sort of a permit license or
check

03:37:19.590 --> 03:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
check
 
03:37:22.309 --> 03:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
which is why this was instituted
 
03:37:25.030 --> 03:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
that five day wait um went away on
 
03:37:28.389 --> 03:37:28.399 align:start position:0%
november 30th 1998 when a national
 
03:37:30.870 --> 03:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
instant check system came online
 
03:37:33.429 --> 03:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
and also extended the check to rifles
 
03:37:36.309 --> 03:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
and shotguns as well as handguns
 
03:37:38.630 --> 03:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's law had an automatic
 
03:37:40.309 --> 03:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
sunset provision
 
03:37:42.389 --> 03:37:42.399 align:start position:0%
but the state kept doing it for a year
 
03:37:43.990 --> 03:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
under what we believe is an illegal
 
03:37:46.070 --> 03:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
executive order i've written about this
 
03:37:47.910 --> 03:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
in my testimony
 
03:37:51.190 --> 03:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
and then a year later they passed what
 
03:37:53.110 --> 03:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
the law that we have now that allows the
 
03:37:54.950 --> 03:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
state police to be a point of contact
 
03:37:56.950 --> 03:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly not only has the law
 
03:37:58.870 --> 03:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
outlived its usefulness
 
03:38:01.429 --> 03:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
the current law has far fewer checks and
 
03:38:03.349 --> 03:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
balances and protections
 
03:38:06.469 --> 03:38:06.479 align:start position:0%
than the law that it replaced in 1999
 
03:38:08.870 --> 03:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
so no there is no benefit to new
 
03:38:10.150 --> 03:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire doing it and there's a
 
03:38:12.389 --> 03:38:12.399 align:start position:0%
detriment and the detriment is we are
 
03:38:14.710 --> 03:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
spending state tax dollars using state
 
03:38:16.870 --> 03:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
employees state resources state
 
03:38:16.880 --> 03:38:17.990 align:start position:0%
employees state resources state
computers

03:38:17.990 --> 03:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
computers
 
03:38:20.229 --> 03:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
to perform a federally mandated task
 
03:38:22.630 --> 03:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
that the federal government will perform
 
03:38:24.550 --> 03:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
free of charge
 
03:38:28.550 --> 03:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:31.429 --> 03:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:31.439 --> 03:38:32.710 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:38:32.710 --> 03:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:38:40.309 --> 03:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:41.269 --> 03:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:38:43.510 --> 03:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman
 
03:38:46.950 --> 03:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr rice for taking my question
 
03:38:49.990 --> 03:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
in um dialing back to your testimony
 
03:38:52.950 --> 03:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
um i want to ask my question is
 
03:38:56.550 --> 03:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
that excuse me
 
03:39:00.150 --> 03:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
since new hampshire does not have
 
03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
any kind of background check for private
 
03:39:03.840 --> 03:39:05.429 align:start position:0%
any kind of background check for private
sales

03:39:05.429 --> 03:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
sales
 
03:39:07.670 --> 03:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
anything that's done
 
03:39:10.710 --> 03:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
with federally licensed firearm dealers
 
03:39:10.720 --> 03:39:11.510 align:start position:0%
with federally licensed firearm dealers
rea

03:39:11.510 --> 03:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
rea
 
03:39:15.269 --> 03:39:15.279 align:start position:0%
is it your testimony that um
 
03:39:15.279 --> 03:39:16.950 align:start position:0%
is it your testimony that um
the

03:39:16.950 --> 03:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:39:18.389 --> 03:39:18.399 align:start position:0%
that people are
 
03:39:20.070 --> 03:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
impinged or
 
03:39:23.269 --> 03:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
are unable to buy weapons because
 
03:39:25.910 --> 03:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
in one arena there might be a delay but
 
03:39:28.150 --> 03:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
in another arena arena
 
03:39:32.790 --> 03:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:34.630 --> 03:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
well there's a two-part answer to your
 
03:39:37.750 --> 03:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
question representative sure so you are
 
03:39:40.150 --> 03:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
correct new hampshire does not regulate
 
03:39:41.670 --> 03:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
the matter in which people sell their
 
03:39:43.349 --> 03:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
personal property
 
03:39:44.870 --> 03:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
um and neither does the federal
 
03:39:46.469 --> 03:39:46.479 align:start position:0%
government if they're not selling it as
 
03:39:48.550 --> 03:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
a business if they're not engaged in the
 
03:39:51.269 --> 03:39:51.279 align:start position:0%
business of selling guns for profit
 
03:39:53.269 --> 03:39:53.279 align:start position:0%
so if you and i um were personally
 
03:39:55.750 --> 03:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
acquainted to one another beyond this tv
 
03:39:57.830 --> 03:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
screen we could sell one another
 
03:40:00.309 --> 03:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
handguns and that would be legal
 
03:40:03.670 --> 03:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
but many people that we hear from want a
 
03:40:05.830 --> 03:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
specific type of gun in a specific
 
03:40:08.469 --> 03:40:08.479 align:start position:0%
caliber in a specific color and the only
 
03:40:10.309 --> 03:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
way to get exactly what they want is to
 
03:40:12.150 --> 03:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
go to a federally licensed gun dealer
 
03:40:13.990 --> 03:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
and say i want that
 
03:40:16.309 --> 03:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
and it's the gun dealers who are
 
03:40:19.510 --> 03:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
required to conduct these checks and
 
03:40:21.910 --> 03:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
these checks as i testified are subject
 
03:40:23.750 --> 03:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
to massive delays
 
03:40:26.550 --> 03:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
and so the dealer's business is harmed
 
03:40:29.190 --> 03:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
the gun buyer has to wait i mean we
 
03:40:30.790 --> 03:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
don't believe
 
03:40:32.950 --> 03:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
it's in any way a crime fighting
 
03:40:35.510 --> 03:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
tool um because if it was the states
 
03:40:37.750 --> 03:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
that had significant controls with
 
03:40:39.110 --> 03:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
permits to just have a gun in your
 
03:40:39.120 --> 03:40:40.150 align:start position:0%
permits to just have a gun in your
bedroom

03:40:40.150 --> 03:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
bedroom
 
03:40:41.830 --> 03:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
would have far lower crime rates than
 
03:40:43.830 --> 03:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and the actually the
 
03:40:45.990 --> 03:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
opposite is true the states with these
 
03:40:47.670 --> 03:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
government-issued permission slips and
 
03:40:49.670 --> 03:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
restrictions and permits
 
03:40:51.349 --> 03:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
have higher crime rates and more
 
03:40:53.349 --> 03:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
violence than new hampshire like chicago
 
03:40:54.550 --> 03:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
and new york
 
03:40:54.560 --> 03:40:55.349 align:start position:0%
and new york
so

03:40:55.349 --> 03:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:40:56.950 --> 03:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
we don't believe the system is a
 
03:40:58.790 --> 03:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
consumer fraud we don't believe it works
 
03:41:01.269 --> 03:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
anyway there's a ton of false positives
 
03:41:03.910 --> 03:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
and in the specific new hampshire
 
03:41:06.070 --> 03:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
state gun line the delays and
 
03:41:07.750 --> 03:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
inefficiencies have gotten to the point
 
03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
where it needs to be abolished disbanded
 
03:41:16.550 --> 03:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:18.550 --> 03:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative i'll show you recognized
 
03:41:20.870 --> 03:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up question
 
03:41:22.550 --> 03:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:41:24.870 --> 03:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
mr rice in the previous testimony we
 
03:41:26.630 --> 03:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
heard from the new hampshire coalition
 
03:41:29.269 --> 03:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
against domestic and sexual violence
 
03:41:31.670 --> 03:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
this particular piece of legislation
 
03:41:34.229 --> 03:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
leaves a hole in it where survivors of
 
03:41:37.429 --> 03:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
violence and victims of crime
 
03:41:39.990 --> 03:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
can further be exploited is that a
 
03:41:41.910 --> 03:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
concern at all to the new hampshire gun
 
03:41:44.469 --> 03:41:44.479 align:start position:0%
owners association well first of all the
 
03:41:47.110 --> 03:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
organization is gun owners of america
 
03:41:48.630 --> 03:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
and i am the new hampshire state
 
03:41:48.640 --> 03:41:49.910 align:start position:0%
and i am the new hampshire state
director

03:41:49.910 --> 03:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
director
 
03:41:51.429 --> 03:41:51.439 align:start position:0%
to answer your question i would
 
03:41:54.229 --> 03:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
encourage all of those survivors to buy
 
03:41:56.870 --> 03:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
firearms seek out professional training
 
03:41:58.550 --> 03:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
and take responsibility for their own
 
03:42:00.630 --> 03:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
personal safety and security
 
03:42:03.269 --> 03:42:03.279 align:start position:0%
we should not hamper the vast majority
 
03:42:05.429 --> 03:42:05.439 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire residents who do not
 
03:42:07.830 --> 03:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
commit crimes who do not commit violence
 
03:42:09.990 --> 03:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
and make them wade and be delayed
 
03:42:12.309 --> 03:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
because a small subset decides to become
 
03:42:12.319 --> 03:42:16.469 align:start position:0%
because a small subset decides to become
criminals

03:42:16.469 --> 03:42:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:19.750 --> 03:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:19.760 --> 03:42:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:42:20.870 --> 03:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:42:22.469 --> 03:42:22.479 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question a quick
 
03:42:24.630 --> 03:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr uh chairman uh
 
03:42:27.830 --> 03:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr rice for taking my question
 
03:42:29.990 --> 03:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
earlier today we had a representative
 
03:42:32.630 --> 03:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
from the leader firearms coalition
 
03:42:37.190 --> 03:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh testified against speech sp 141
 
03:42:40.870 --> 03:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
and now you on their website are are
 
03:42:43.830 --> 03:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
according to the nhse website you are
 
03:42:46.870 --> 03:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
the president of an hsc
 
03:42:49.910 --> 03:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
and you're testifying for the bill so
 
03:42:53.269 --> 03:42:53.279 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to understand the confusion
 
03:42:55.830 --> 03:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
i have not been president nor affiliated
 
03:42:57.830 --> 03:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
with nhfc since
 
03:42:57.840 --> 03:43:00.950 align:start position:0%
with nhfc since
2019.

03:43:00.950 --> 03:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:04.070 --> 03:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
i work for gun owners of america
 
03:43:05.910 --> 03:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
and for a period of time i was doing
 
03:43:07.510 --> 03:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
double duty because i have worked for
 
03:43:09.269 --> 03:43:09.279 align:start position:0%
gun owners of america since the mid
 
03:43:09.279 --> 03:43:15.590 align:start position:0%
gun owners of america since the mid
1990s

03:43:15.590 --> 03:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:15.600 --> 03:43:16.389 align:start position:0%
 
just

03:43:16.389 --> 03:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:43:19.030 --> 03:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
so so they're uh thank you
 
03:43:22.389 --> 03:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
so their website is incorrect
 
03:43:24.150 --> 03:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
i can't control the website of an
 
03:43:25.590 --> 03:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
organization that i'm no longer
 
03:43:26.950 --> 03:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
affiliated with
 
03:43:31.910 --> 03:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:34.870 --> 03:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
very much recognize her question
 
03:43:36.309 --> 03:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
03:43:39.110 --> 03:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh mr rice so if i heard you correctly
 
03:43:41.750 --> 03:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
you just stated that
 
03:43:45.030 --> 03:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
the turnaround time to obtain a gun
 
03:43:47.110 --> 03:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
is more important
 
03:43:50.150 --> 03:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
than protecting survivors is that
 
03:43:54.870 --> 03:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:56.950 --> 03:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
what i said was i would encourage
 
03:44:00.150 --> 03:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
survivors to buy a firearm and learn how
 
03:44:02.070 --> 03:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
to use it and take responsibility for
 
03:44:04.229 --> 03:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
their own personal safety and quite
 
03:44:06.469 --> 03:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
frankly my organization finds it very
 
03:44:08.630 --> 03:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
objectionable that new hampshire has
 
03:44:10.150 --> 03:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
more restrictions
 
03:44:12.070 --> 03:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
on the purchase ownership and use of
 
03:44:14.229 --> 03:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
firearms than those that are found in
 
03:44:15.990 --> 03:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
federal law and the majority of other
 
03:44:18.550 --> 03:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
states and i'm specifically referring
 
03:44:20.150 --> 03:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
to the restrictions not on those
 
03:44:22.150 --> 03:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
convicted of domestic violence not on
 
03:44:24.309 --> 03:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
those convicted of stalking but those
 
03:44:26.309 --> 03:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
who are merely accused and subject to
 
03:44:28.309 --> 03:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
court orders those are not federal
 
03:44:31.030 --> 03:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
prohibitors those are mere accusations
 
03:44:32.070 --> 03:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
and you should not lose your
 
03:44:35.349 --> 03:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights over an accusation
 
03:44:35.359 --> 03:44:37.429 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights over an accusation
follow-up

03:44:37.429 --> 03:44:37.439 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:44:39.110 --> 03:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized for a
 
03:44:39.120 --> 03:44:40.550 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized for a
follow-up

03:44:40.550 --> 03:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:44:43.110 --> 03:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so your solutions to this is
 
03:44:45.030 --> 03:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
to put the onus of owning a gun on
 
03:44:45.040 --> 03:44:46.229 align:start position:0%
to put the onus of owning a gun on
domestic

03:44:46.229 --> 03:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
domestic
 
03:44:48.950 --> 03:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
violence survivors
 
03:44:51.750 --> 03:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
03:44:56.070 --> 03:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
looking at this as i mean this is just
 
03:44:59.269 --> 03:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
prohibiting i mean looking into this
 
03:45:01.269 --> 03:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
further you want to put the onus on
 
03:45:04.389 --> 03:45:04.399 align:start position:0%
domestic violence survivors
 
03:45:06.550 --> 03:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
so you have
 
03:45:09.590 --> 03:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
your guns in a timely manner
 
03:45:10.830 --> 03:45:10.840 align:start position:0%
what i said
 
03:45:13.030 --> 03:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative is that
 
03:45:15.830 --> 03:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
if someone is a victim of violence
 
03:45:18.229 --> 03:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
they should buy a gun learn how to use
 
03:45:20.389 --> 03:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
it and take responsibility for their own
 
03:45:21.910 --> 03:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
personal safety
 
03:45:24.630 --> 03:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
americans as a group are self-reliant
 
03:45:26.389 --> 03:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
and if you become reliant upon
 
03:45:28.950 --> 03:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
government you generally lose
 
03:45:30.870 --> 03:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
people who have been subjected to
 
03:45:33.030 --> 03:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
violence which is wrong and we condemn
 
03:45:33.040 --> 03:45:33.830 align:start position:0%
violence which is wrong and we condemn
it

03:45:33.830 --> 03:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:45:35.990 --> 03:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
should also take responsibility for
 
03:45:37.990 --> 03:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
their own personal safety and as a
 
03:45:40.469 --> 03:45:40.479 align:start position:0%
firearms instructor i have trained
 
03:45:42.469 --> 03:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
many victims of domestic violence and
 
03:45:44.150 --> 03:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
when i have been told
 
03:45:45.830 --> 03:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
of what their case is
 
03:45:47.830 --> 03:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
i usually give them private lessons so
 
03:45:49.910 --> 03:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
they don't have to sit in a large group
 
03:45:55.510 --> 03:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:57.510 --> 03:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight you were
 
03:46:00.550 --> 03:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
03:46:02.710 --> 03:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you sir
 
03:46:04.469 --> 03:46:04.479 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:46:07.349 --> 03:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
so am i to believe that if a victim
 
03:46:08.870 --> 03:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have enough time to buy a
 
03:46:11.510 --> 03:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
firearm train themselves how to use it
 
03:46:13.670 --> 03:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
and instead
 
03:46:14.790 --> 03:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
winds up
 
03:46:16.950 --> 03:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
murdered it is their fault and they are
 
03:46:18.950 --> 03:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
being irresponsible
 
03:46:20.870 --> 03:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
i think you're over sensationalizing
 
03:46:22.309 --> 03:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
representative first of all if they
 
03:46:23.830 --> 03:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
don't have enough time to buy it it's
 
03:46:25.269 --> 03:46:25.279 align:start position:0%
because the state police gun line
 
03:46:27.189 --> 03:46:27.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
 
03:46:28.630 --> 03:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
second of all it doesn't take an
 
03:46:31.269 --> 03:46:31.279 align:start position:0%
eternity to learn how to use a firearm
 
03:46:32.550 --> 03:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
third of all
 
03:46:34.870 --> 03:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of people who obey the
 
03:46:36.710 --> 03:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
law and follow the law
 
03:46:37.990 --> 03:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
should not
 
03:46:39.429 --> 03:46:39.439 align:start position:0%
be delayed
 
03:46:41.590 --> 03:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
and have their rights hampered
 
03:46:42.790 --> 03:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
because new hampshire has a more
 
03:46:44.710 --> 03:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
restrictive statute with respect to
 
03:46:47.750 --> 03:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
domestic violence accusations not
 
03:46:49.990 --> 03:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
convictions accusations
 
03:46:51.830 --> 03:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
than the federal law and we know from
 
03:46:54.870 --> 03:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
experience that defense and deport
 
03:46:58.309 --> 03:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
divorce lawyers use these accusations as
 
03:46:59.830 --> 03:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
a way to gain leverage in court
 
03:47:01.990 --> 03:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
proceedings and oftentimes it comes out
 
03:47:04.630 --> 03:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
that they were lies anyway
 
03:47:08.309 --> 03:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:09.990 --> 03:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
you were recognized for a follow-up
 
03:47:10.000 --> 03:47:11.030 align:start position:0%
you were recognized for a follow-up
question

03:47:11.030 --> 03:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:47:14.229 --> 03:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
thank you so earlier in your testimony
 
03:47:16.229 --> 03:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
you said we should be relying on the
 
03:47:18.229 --> 03:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
federal government to do these
 
03:47:19.910 --> 03:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
background checks but you just said that
 
03:47:21.750 --> 03:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
we're too reliant on the government and
 
03:47:23.189 --> 03:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
that you don't trust the government to
 
03:47:24.630 --> 03:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
do these background checks can you
 
03:47:26.469 --> 03:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
clarify your stance
 
03:47:28.469 --> 03:47:28.479 align:start position:0%
you're twisting my words
 
03:47:30.150 --> 03:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
what i said was the new hampshire gun
 
03:47:31.990 --> 03:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
line has proven that it's an inefficient
 
03:47:34.389 --> 03:47:34.399 align:start position:0%
system it doesn't work people have been
 
03:47:36.469 --> 03:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
forced to wait in some cases months to
 
03:47:38.710 --> 03:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
purchase a brand new handgun
 
03:47:40.550 --> 03:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
the federal system which checks the
 
03:47:42.790 --> 03:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
buyers of rifles and shotguns has proven
 
03:47:45.269 --> 03:47:45.279 align:start position:0%
to be a very efficient system
 
03:47:47.590 --> 03:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
people are approved in a
 
03:47:49.910 --> 03:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
matter of minutes and they walk out with
 
03:47:52.630 --> 03:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
their new purchase in general we are
 
03:47:54.389 --> 03:47:54.399 align:start position:0%
opposed to background checks to begin
 
03:47:54.399 --> 03:47:55.429 align:start position:0%
opposed to background checks to begin
with

03:47:55.429 --> 03:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:47:57.030 --> 03:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
but if we're going to have a check and
 
03:47:58.389 --> 03:47:58.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to be stuck with this
 
03:47:59.830 --> 03:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
federal mandate
 
03:48:01.349 --> 03:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
why should we have a second set of
 
03:48:03.670 --> 03:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats at the state level and give
 
03:48:06.070 --> 03:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
them the ability to foul up a gun sale
 
03:48:07.750 --> 03:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
when one set of bureaucrats is bad
 
03:48:07.760 --> 03:48:13.269 align:start position:0%
when one set of bureaucrats is bad
enough

03:48:13.269 --> 03:48:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:15.670 --> 03:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
but thank you mr rice seeing no further
 
03:48:17.189 --> 03:48:17.199 align:start position:0%
hands raised i want to thank to win this
 
03:48:18.950 --> 03:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
first testimony at this time the chair
 
03:48:18.960 --> 03:48:21.269 align:start position:0%
first testimony at this time the chair
recognizes

03:48:21.269 --> 03:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
recognizes
 
03:48:22.950 --> 03:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
the testimony will be limited to three
 
03:48:22.960 --> 03:48:26.389 align:start position:0%
the testimony will be limited to three
minutes

03:48:26.389 --> 03:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:28.229 --> 03:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
thank you i will try to be incredibly
 
03:48:29.429 --> 03:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
brief because i know the committee's had
 
03:48:31.429 --> 03:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
a long day um chairman abbas vice
 
03:48:33.030 --> 03:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
chairman welch and distinguished members
 
03:48:34.790 --> 03:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is lauren
 
03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
lepage and i'm the new hampshire state
 
03:48:37.590 --> 03:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
director for the national rifle
 
03:48:39.590 --> 03:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
association i'm here to testify in
 
03:48:41.510 --> 03:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
strong support of this critical piece of
 
03:48:43.510 --> 03:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
legislation and we want to extend our
 
03:48:45.429 --> 03:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
sincere thank you to senator gaida for
 
03:48:47.349 --> 03:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
putting this bill in i've submitted
 
03:48:48.950 --> 03:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
written testimony so for the sake of
 
03:48:51.189 --> 03:48:51.199 align:start position:0%
brevity i will just summarize it briefly
 
03:48:53.189 --> 03:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
for the committee the vast majority of
 
03:48:55.030 --> 03:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
states are non-point of contact states
 
03:48:57.189 --> 03:48:57.199 align:start position:0%
meaning that they use nics for all of
 
03:48:59.429 --> 03:48:59.439 align:start position:0%
all of their firearm purchases i believe
 
03:49:02.469 --> 03:49:02.479 align:start position:0%
the exact number is 36 states use the
 
03:49:03.750 --> 03:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
next system
 
03:49:05.189 --> 03:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
and although it's appreciated the gun
 
03:49:07.030 --> 03:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
line has tried to increase efficiency in
 
03:49:08.150 --> 03:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
03:49:09.670 --> 03:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
it is absolutely no
 
03:49:11.990 --> 03:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
no guarantee that the delays will not
 
03:49:13.590 --> 03:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
occur again there is absolutely no
 
03:49:14.950 --> 03:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
excuse for ju
 
03:49:16.710 --> 03:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
for justifying jeopardizing someone's
 
03:49:18.870 --> 03:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
right to self-defense because of a lack
 
03:49:20.389 --> 03:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
of government resources when the next
 
03:49:22.389 --> 03:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
system is readily available
 
03:49:24.150 --> 03:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is simple it authorized the
 
03:49:26.229 --> 03:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
fbi to conduct all checks similar to
 
03:49:28.150 --> 03:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
most northeastern states including
 
03:49:30.229 --> 03:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
massachusetts new york maine
 
03:49:32.550 --> 03:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
vermont rhode island it streamlines the
 
03:49:34.070 --> 03:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
background check system it reduces
 
03:49:36.229 --> 03:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
delays and it will save taxpayer money
 
03:49:37.670 --> 03:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
and this bill is the only way to
 
03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
guarantee that delays will not return on
 
03:49:42.550 --> 03:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
behalf of the thousands of members
 
03:49:44.229 --> 03:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
across new hampshire we strongly urge
 
03:49:46.309 --> 03:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
the committee to support this bill i do
 
03:49:47.670 --> 03:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
just want to take a brief minute to
 
03:49:49.670 --> 03:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
respond to a question asked earlier by
 
03:49:52.309 --> 03:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
representative al shuler about how many
 
03:49:54.550 --> 03:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
new gun owners purchased firearms in
 
03:49:57.349 --> 03:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
2020 um according to the national
 
03:49:58.870 --> 03:49:58.880 align:start position:0%

03:50:02.710 --> 03:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
americans bought their first firearm in
 
03:50:05.590 --> 03:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
2020 that accounted for roughly 40 of
 
03:50:07.830 --> 03:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
firearm purchases for people who did not
 
03:50:09.670 --> 03:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
previously own one
 
03:50:12.710 --> 03:50:12.720 align:start position:0%

just to correct uh miss
 
03:51:10.790 --> 03:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
lepage's uh statistics it's actually
 
03:51:12.870 --> 03:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
eight million new gun owners that's a
 
03:51:14.229 --> 03:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
more recent number
 
03:51:16.389 --> 03:51:16.399 align:start position:0%
of those eight million new gun owners 40
 
03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
of them are female and we've seen a 63
 
03:51:21.269 --> 03:51:21.279 align:start position:0%
increase in
 
03:51:23.189 --> 03:51:23.199 align:start position:0%
african americans purchasing firearms
 
03:51:26.630 --> 03:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
for protection uh in their homes
 
03:51:27.990 --> 03:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
this has been quite a contentious
 
03:51:28.000 --> 03:51:29.189 align:start position:0%
this has been quite a contentious
hearing

03:51:29.189 --> 03:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:51:30.950 --> 03:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
for the past four hours and i appreciate
 
03:51:33.510 --> 03:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
everyone spending their time uh you know
 
03:51:35.189 --> 03:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
sitting here
 
03:51:37.110 --> 03:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
what i like to point out is that i think
 
03:51:38.870 --> 03:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
that every single person on this
 
03:51:41.269 --> 03:51:41.279 align:start position:0%
committee on both sides of the aisle
 
03:51:43.110 --> 03:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
should want to make sure that prohibited
 
03:51:44.950 --> 03:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
people are not gaining access to
 
03:51:47.429 --> 03:51:47.439 align:start position:0%
firearms and what continued to come up
 
03:51:49.510 --> 03:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
in this and from the trade association
 
03:51:51.670 --> 03:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
the last thing our members want is for
 
03:51:53.349 --> 03:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
for prohibited people to gain access to
 
03:51:53.359 --> 03:51:54.469 align:start position:0%
for prohibited people to gain access to
firearms

03:51:54.469 --> 03:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
firearms
 
03:51:56.389 --> 03:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
what people need to realize though here
 
03:51:58.469 --> 03:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
is we continue to talk about the
 
03:52:01.030 --> 03:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
domestic violence issue
 
03:52:02.710 --> 03:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
with the handgun and with the gun line
 
03:52:04.469 --> 03:52:04.479 align:start position:0%
we know the gun line's broken without
 
03:52:05.910 --> 03:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
this bill they would have come and tried
 
03:52:07.189 --> 03:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
to fix this
 
03:52:08.389 --> 03:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
the gun line
 
03:52:10.150 --> 03:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
it's been broken people waiting months
 
03:52:11.429 --> 03:52:11.439 align:start position:0%
for firearms
 
03:52:13.830 --> 03:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
our retailers could not conduct business
 
03:52:15.590 --> 03:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
and they could not really
 
03:52:16.950 --> 03:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
you know sell the firearms that they
 
03:52:18.870 --> 03:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to sell but what we need to
 
03:52:20.630 --> 03:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
realize is
 
03:52:24.150 --> 03:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
that if all these records are being held
 
03:52:26.389 --> 03:52:26.399 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and in the courthouses
 
03:52:29.590 --> 03:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
and not shared with the federal system
 
03:52:29.600 --> 03:52:31.030 align:start position:0%
and not shared with the federal system
individuals

03:52:31.030 --> 03:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
03:52:33.349 --> 03:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
and victims of domestic violence
 
03:52:35.750 --> 03:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
will still be at risk because those
 
03:52:38.550 --> 03:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
individuals can buy long guns meaning
 
03:52:42.229 --> 03:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
a semi-automatic rifles in shotguns
 
03:52:43.990 --> 03:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
how is that any different they're still
 
03:52:46.469 --> 03:52:46.479 align:start position:0%
going to be at risk what we want to do
 
03:52:48.309 --> 03:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
is if it's such a big issue in new
 
03:52:49.990 --> 03:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire and they have all these
 
03:52:52.229 --> 03:52:52.239 align:start position:0%
secretive files that they're not using
 
03:52:54.389 --> 03:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't those files be and shouldn't
 
03:52:57.269 --> 03:52:57.279 align:start position:0%
be we we be using the nic system
 
03:52:59.349 --> 03:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
again it's only going to take a tragedy
 
03:53:00.710 --> 03:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
where individuals are going to have to
 
03:53:02.309 --> 03:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
point fingers at each other and
 
03:53:03.670 --> 03:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
legislators are going to point fingers
 
03:53:05.110 --> 03:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
and say well how this individual get
 
03:53:07.189 --> 03:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
this firearm very similar to the
 
03:53:09.910 --> 03:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
manchester uh cops that were shot by an
 
03:53:12.070 --> 03:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
individual who should not have had that
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
firearm so again as a trade association
 
03:53:17.110 --> 03:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
we want it to be streamlined we want to
 
03:53:20.309 --> 03:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
be efficient we support sb 141 and we
 
03:53:21.990 --> 03:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
also support those rights of domestic
 
03:53:23.910 --> 03:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
violence victims but i think
 
03:53:26.630 --> 03:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
they are being exposed to
 
03:53:26.640 --> 03:53:27.910 align:start position:0%
they are being exposed to
um

03:53:27.910 --> 03:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
really an issue because of
 
03:53:31.830 --> 03:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire not sharing those
 
03:53:33.990 --> 03:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
records and the ability for individuals
 
03:53:35.590 --> 03:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
to purchase long guns because they're
 
03:53:37.189 --> 03:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
not using the gun line
 
03:53:39.110 --> 03:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'd be happy to take
 
03:53:41.269 --> 03:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
any questions for that
 
03:53:43.189 --> 03:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
and i'll try to keep it short so thank
 
03:53:43.199 --> 03:53:48.229 align:start position:0%
and i'll try to keep it short so thank
you

03:53:48.229 --> 03:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:51.030 --> 03:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh thank you
 
03:53:55.510 --> 03:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:57.269 --> 03:53:57.279 align:start position:0%
in your experience
 
03:53:57.279 --> 03:53:59.189 align:start position:0%
in your experience
nationwide

03:53:59.189 --> 03:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
nationwide
 
03:54:01.269 --> 03:54:01.279 align:start position:0%
with states that have you know that go
 
03:54:03.670 --> 03:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
directly right to next and they don't go
 
03:54:05.750 --> 03:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
to their state police like we do
 
03:54:07.750 --> 03:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
and then states like new hampshire where
 
03:54:07.760 --> 03:54:08.469 align:start position:0%
and then states like new hampshire where
we

03:54:08.469 --> 03:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:54:10.309 --> 03:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
buy a handgun goes through
 
03:54:13.750 --> 03:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
state police they go the knicks
 
03:54:15.189 --> 03:54:15.199 align:start position:0%
have you
 
03:54:16.710 --> 03:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
what are the
 
03:54:19.590 --> 03:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
issues that you see that are different
 
03:54:22.950 --> 03:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
from the state's point of contact
 
03:54:24.630 --> 03:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
representative byrd i appreciate that
 
03:54:24.640 --> 03:54:26.070 align:start position:0%
representative byrd i appreciate that
question

03:54:26.070 --> 03:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:54:28.469 --> 03:54:28.479 align:start position:0%
what we have seen in those states that
 
03:54:30.710 --> 03:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
have their own in-state systems we have
 
03:54:33.110 --> 03:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
situations with delays we have systems
 
03:54:35.590 --> 03:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
we have issues with staffing we have
 
03:54:37.590 --> 03:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
some states out west that actually
 
03:54:40.229 --> 03:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
started to charge for background check
 
03:54:43.030 --> 03:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
systems in order to cover their costs so
 
03:54:44.870 --> 03:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
essentially what it ends up being is is
 
03:54:46.790 --> 03:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
a what we would call a poll tax or a
 
03:54:49.110 --> 03:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
second amendment tax on the purchase of
 
03:54:50.550 --> 03:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
a firearm
 
03:54:53.349 --> 03:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
but what we've seen recently with covet
 
03:54:54.950 --> 03:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
over the past year
 
03:54:57.510 --> 03:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
is that some states that did not
 
03:54:59.830 --> 03:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
recognize the firearms industry as
 
03:55:01.990 --> 03:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
having essential businesses
 
03:55:04.389 --> 03:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
if they had an in-state background check
 
03:55:06.790 --> 03:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
system they had the ability to shut down
 
03:55:08.790 --> 03:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
those background check systems
 
03:55:11.030 --> 03:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
and then those individuals would not be
 
03:55:13.110 --> 03:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
able to and our retailers would not be
 
03:55:14.790 --> 03:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
able to sell
 
03:55:16.950 --> 03:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
those firearms more specifically that
 
03:55:18.550 --> 03:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
would be new jersey
 
03:55:20.389 --> 03:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
which did that and did shut down that
 
03:55:22.630 --> 03:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
background check system thus limiting
 
03:55:25.750 --> 03:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
the ability to conduct business and then
 
03:55:25.760 --> 03:55:27.030 align:start position:0%
the ability to conduct business and then
secondly

03:55:27.030 --> 03:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
03:55:29.830 --> 03:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
with business with budget constraints
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
we do see a lot of
 
03:55:34.870 --> 03:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
retailers impacted
 
03:55:38.710 --> 03:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
by furloughs or changing of hours
 
03:55:41.510 --> 03:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
many states don't keep retail hours
 
03:55:43.510 --> 03:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
they'll do their background check system
 
03:55:47.030 --> 03:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
from 10 am to 4 pm and obviously many
 
03:55:48.710 --> 03:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
people will go and purchase firearms
 
03:55:50.710 --> 03:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
after the work you know after work hours
 
03:55:50.720 --> 03:55:51.429 align:start position:0%
after the work you know after work hours
so

03:55:51.429 --> 03:55:51.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:55:53.189 --> 03:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
you know and we're seeing that here
 
03:55:54.469 --> 03:55:54.479 align:start position:0%
specifically in new hampshire because
 
03:55:56.550 --> 03:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
they are kind of controlling that gun
 
03:55:58.309 --> 03:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
line and you know obviously they're
 
03:56:00.389 --> 03:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
trying to say now that it's much much
 
03:56:02.389 --> 03:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
more efficient and quicker again without
 
03:56:03.910 --> 03:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
this bill that wouldn't have happened
 
03:56:05.349 --> 03:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
but it's only going to take another
 
03:56:06.710 --> 03:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
situation where they're going to pull
 
03:56:09.269 --> 03:56:09.279 align:start position:0%
back uh and have have that but the
 
03:56:11.429 --> 03:56:11.439 align:start position:0%
states that go to the fbi system i mean
 
03:56:13.349 --> 03:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with two to three minute
 
03:56:13.359 --> 03:56:14.309 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with two to three minute
um

03:56:14.309 --> 03:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:15.990 --> 03:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
you know background checks
 
03:56:17.910 --> 03:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
obviously you have to fill out your 4473
 
03:56:20.070 --> 03:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
and do all that but there have been in
 
03:56:22.150 --> 03:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
the past 10 years
 
03:56:24.389 --> 03:56:24.399 align:start position:0%
the only outage of the nyx system lasted
 
03:56:26.070 --> 03:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
probably about an hour because of an
 
03:56:28.870 --> 03:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
upgrade to some uh software so
 
03:56:30.630 --> 03:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
that would be the big difference that
 
03:56:33.910 --> 03:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire would be impacted by
 
03:56:35.429 --> 03:56:35.439 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
03:56:36.950 --> 03:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:56:38.790 --> 03:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
taking my follow-up
 
03:56:41.670 --> 03:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
have you seen any administrative abuse
 
03:56:41.680 --> 03:56:43.110 align:start position:0%
have you seen any administrative abuse
on

03:56:43.110 --> 03:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:56:45.510 --> 03:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
check systems with the point of contact
 
03:56:45.520 --> 03:56:47.429 align:start position:0%
check systems with the point of contact
states

03:56:47.429 --> 03:56:47.439 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:56:48.630 --> 03:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:56:50.309 --> 03:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
most recently
 
03:56:52.070 --> 03:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
some of our big box and what i mean by
 
03:56:54.229 --> 03:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
big boxes i mean a cabela's or a
 
03:56:57.510 --> 03:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
sportsman's warehouse or bass pro shops
 
03:56:58.790 --> 03:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
out west
 
03:57:01.429 --> 03:57:01.439 align:start position:0%
specifically in the state of nevada
 
03:57:02.630 --> 03:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:57:05.590 --> 03:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
two count them two
 
03:57:08.870 --> 03:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
people answering phones in nevada
 
03:57:10.550 --> 03:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine with covid they've
 
03:57:10.560 --> 03:57:11.349 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine with covid they've
had

03:57:11.349 --> 03:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
had
 
03:57:13.990 --> 03:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
las vegas has been completely decimated
 
03:57:15.349 --> 03:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
from a revenue standpoint which
 
03:57:17.670 --> 03:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
obviously is impacting the state budget
 
03:57:19.990 --> 03:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
so we have large big box retailers that
 
03:57:23.349 --> 03:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
now have one dedicated person on staff
 
03:57:26.070 --> 03:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
whose job is basically to call in or
 
03:57:27.990 --> 03:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
continue to redial to call into the
 
03:57:30.710 --> 03:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
state in order to get a live person and
 
03:57:33.189 --> 03:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
then have a stack of forms
 
03:57:35.830 --> 03:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
to conduct that background check um you
 
03:57:37.510 --> 03:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
know they'll have you know be waiting on
 
03:57:39.349 --> 03:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
40 or 50 of them so those are the types
 
03:57:41.910 --> 03:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
of abuses we see because again
 
03:57:43.990 --> 03:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
the state's paying for it it's a budget
 
03:57:45.510 --> 03:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
impact and if they're have budget
 
03:57:47.030 --> 03:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
constraints they start changing the
 
03:57:48.870 --> 03:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
hours they start furloughing or they
 
03:57:51.830 --> 03:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
just um you know aren't answering calls
 
03:57:53.510 --> 03:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
we never see that on obviously in the
 
03:57:56.710 --> 03:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
federal system i've been to the knicks
 
03:57:58.950 --> 03:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
system in martinsburg west virginia an
 
03:58:01.110 --> 03:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
amazing facility
 
03:58:02.950 --> 03:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
great people there they do a great job
 
03:58:04.469 --> 03:58:04.479 align:start position:0%
and they can turn around background
 
03:58:06.389 --> 03:58:06.399 align:start position:0%
checks in less than two to three minutes
 
03:58:06.399 --> 03:58:07.349 align:start position:0%
checks in less than two to three minutes
and

03:58:07.349 --> 03:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:58:09.510 --> 03:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
background checks that our retailers can
 
03:58:11.189 --> 03:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
be confident in
 
03:58:13.670 --> 03:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
again our retailers want to make sure
 
03:58:15.429 --> 03:58:15.439 align:start position:0%
that when they sell that firearm it's
 
03:58:17.750 --> 03:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
not going to a prohibited person right
 
03:58:19.590 --> 03:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
they don't want a knock on their door
 
03:58:21.750 --> 03:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
two days later after a horrific tragedy
 
03:58:21.760 --> 03:58:22.790 align:start position:0%
two days later after a horrific tragedy
saying

03:58:22.790 --> 03:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
saying
 
03:58:24.710 --> 03:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
why this gun you know
 
03:58:27.030 --> 03:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
you sold this firearm and they're
 
03:58:28.790 --> 03:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
basically in the media limelight
 
03:58:30.630 --> 03:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
spotlight because of that
 
03:58:33.110 --> 03:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
so that's we our guys just want the
 
03:58:34.870 --> 03:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
confidence that that when they transfer
 
03:58:36.710 --> 03:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
a firearm it's going to be done right
 
03:58:39.110 --> 03:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
efficiently and they can be confident in
 
03:58:40.309 --> 03:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
03:58:46.229 --> 03:58:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:48.389 --> 03:58:48.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:58:51.349 --> 03:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
you represent a gun manufacturer's uh
 
03:58:54.550 --> 03:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
trade association and you say that uh
 
03:58:56.790 --> 03:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh 8 million guns were sold across the
 
03:58:59.429 --> 03:58:59.439 align:start position:0%
country last year i'm curious what the
 
03:59:01.750 --> 03:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
economic impact of the delays
 
03:59:03.590 --> 03:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
specifically of the new hampshire gun
 
03:59:03.600 --> 03:59:04.950 align:start position:0%
specifically of the new hampshire gun
line

03:59:04.950 --> 03:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
line
 
03:59:07.590 --> 03:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
what that has been on manufacturers like
 
03:59:09.590 --> 03:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
the ones you represent
 
03:59:11.990 --> 03:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you representative
 
03:59:12.000 --> 03:59:13.030 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you representative
the

03:59:13.030 --> 03:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:59:15.189 --> 03:59:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh statistics actually is eight million
 
03:59:17.110 --> 03:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
new gun owners that's not total number
 
03:59:20.710 --> 03:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
of guns sold in in 2021 um
 
03:59:23.750 --> 03:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
we do it it is a bit of a hardship on on
 
03:59:26.309 --> 03:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
our guys because if we look at it from
 
03:59:28.550 --> 03:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
the federal standpoint right let's
 
03:59:31.030 --> 03:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
assume a consumer comes in and fills out
 
03:59:33.990 --> 03:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
the 4473 which is the form that everyone
 
03:59:36.070 --> 03:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
has to fill out it's a federal form when
 
03:59:37.990 --> 03:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
you purchase a firearm
 
03:59:38.000 --> 03:59:38.950 align:start position:0%
you purchase a firearm
and

03:59:38.950 --> 03:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:40.389 --> 03:59:40.399 align:start position:0%
you end up
 
03:59:43.670 --> 03:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
um the delay ends up being two months
 
03:59:43.680 --> 03:59:44.469 align:start position:0%
um the delay ends up being two months
okay

03:59:44.469 --> 03:59:44.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:59:48.950 --> 03:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
well that 4473 is only good for 30 days
 
03:59:51.910 --> 03:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
okay based on federal law so it puts our
 
03:59:54.389 --> 03:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
retailers in a bit of a
 
03:59:56.630 --> 03:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
situation because now you basically have
 
03:59:58.389 --> 03:59:58.399 align:start position:0%
to go back to the the person that want
 
04:00:00.750 --> 04:00:00.760 align:start position:0%
to purchase a firearm have them redo the
 
04:00:03.510 --> 04:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
4473 and start the process all over
 
04:00:06.469 --> 04:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
again so the concern becomes is you know
 
04:00:09.750 --> 04:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
we in i probably should not i won't say
 
04:00:11.910 --> 04:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
the state but a state that does do their
 
04:00:13.910 --> 04:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
own background check systems
 
04:00:16.150 --> 04:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh system and they were having probably
 
04:00:18.070 --> 04:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
four to five week delays
 
04:00:20.229 --> 04:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
told our retailers in this specific
 
04:00:20.239 --> 04:00:21.110 align:start position:0%
told our retailers in this specific
state

04:00:21.110 --> 04:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:00:23.830 --> 04:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
oh don't worry about the 4473 expire and
 
04:00:26.150 --> 04:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
you can still transfer that firearm
 
04:00:27.269 --> 04:00:27.279 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:00:29.830 --> 04:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
you know and that puts our retailers
 
04:00:31.510 --> 04:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
license their federal license on the
 
04:00:31.520 --> 04:00:32.389 align:start position:0%
license their federal license on the
line

04:00:32.389 --> 04:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:00:35.189 --> 04:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
so the economic impact i would say it
 
04:00:37.510 --> 04:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately just it slows down the
 
04:00:39.349 --> 04:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
course of business you know the new
 
04:00:41.510 --> 04:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire retailers are not
 
04:00:42.630 --> 04:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:00:44.630 --> 04:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm based in
 
04:00:46.469 --> 04:00:46.479 align:start position:0%
both i've been based in connecticut and
 
04:00:48.790 --> 04:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts in both states use the
 
04:00:51.750 --> 04:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
federal system in both states are very
 
04:00:54.070 --> 04:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
efficient and compared to new hampshire
 
04:00:55.750 --> 04:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say that they're very uh
 
04:00:59.189 --> 04:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
compare comparatively pro-gun states
 
04:01:01.269 --> 04:01:01.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:01:06.710 --> 04:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:06.720 --> 04:01:07.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:01:07.750 --> 04:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:11.990 --> 04:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:13.189 --> 04:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
what i'm
 
04:01:15.349 --> 04:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
what i'm wondering is it it sounds like
 
04:01:17.030 --> 04:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
there have been some
 
04:01:19.110 --> 04:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
some inconveniences to manufacturers
 
04:01:21.110 --> 04:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit of lost money
 
04:01:23.429 --> 04:01:23.439 align:start position:0%
um the situation that the state police
 
04:01:25.030 --> 04:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
are trying to avoid
 
04:01:27.269 --> 04:01:27.279 align:start position:0%
um through the current system seems to
 
04:01:28.950 --> 04:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
be one of
 
04:01:28.960 --> 04:01:30.229 align:start position:0%
be one of
preventing

04:01:30.229 --> 04:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
preventing
 
04:01:32.309 --> 04:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
people from actually falling victim to
 
04:01:34.150 --> 04:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
domestic violence
 
04:01:34.160 --> 04:01:35.110 align:start position:0%
domestic violence
uh

04:01:35.110 --> 04:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:01:37.670 --> 04:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm curious what your industry's
 
04:01:40.309 --> 04:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
stance is on protecting
 
04:01:40.319 --> 04:01:41.110 align:start position:0%
stance is on protecting
um

04:01:41.110 --> 04:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:42.550 --> 04:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
04:01:44.870 --> 04:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
people from domestic violence is the
 
04:01:48.070 --> 04:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
answer just as simple as getting uh as
 
04:01:50.870 --> 04:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
many women in that situation as possible
 
04:01:53.750 --> 04:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh to buy guns or do you think that uh
 
04:01:56.389 --> 04:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
government actually has a larger role to
 
04:01:58.469 --> 04:01:58.479 align:start position:0%
play in the process
 
04:02:00.309 --> 04:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um as i
 
04:02:02.710 --> 04:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned in my testimony
 
04:02:05.110 --> 04:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
i think it's being disingenuous to say
 
04:02:06.550 --> 04:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:02:09.269 --> 04:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
gun line is protecting domestic violence
 
04:02:09.279 --> 04:02:10.870 align:start position:0%
gun line is protecting domestic violence
um

04:02:10.870 --> 04:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:10.880 --> 04:02:12.150 align:start position:0%
um
survivors

04:02:12.150 --> 04:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
survivors
 
04:02:14.950 --> 04:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
reason why i say that is because if an
 
04:02:16.550 --> 04:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
individual and
 
04:02:18.950 --> 04:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
let's look at the national level right
 
04:02:20.550 --> 04:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
what do we keep hearing about we keep
 
04:02:21.910 --> 04:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
hearing about quote unquote assault
 
04:02:23.269 --> 04:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
weapons bans
 
04:02:23.279 --> 04:02:24.229 align:start position:0%
weapons bans
okay

04:02:24.229 --> 04:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:02:26.389 --> 04:02:26.399 align:start position:0%
so if we hear about assault weapons bans
 
04:02:28.309 --> 04:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
well that usually will be impacting
 
04:02:30.229 --> 04:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
modding sporting rifles
 
04:02:33.429 --> 04:02:33.439 align:start position:0%
so what is the one firearm that a person
 
04:02:35.670 --> 04:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that allegedly is in
 
04:02:38.229 --> 04:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
these in-state systems can go and
 
04:02:42.070 --> 04:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
purchase and pass a background check
 
04:02:43.910 --> 04:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
and i'll answer the question that would
 
04:02:47.670 --> 04:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
be a modern sporting rifle or a shotgun
 
04:02:49.349 --> 04:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
so the state of new hampshire is not
 
04:02:49.359 --> 04:02:50.150 align:start position:0%
so the state of new hampshire is not
doing

04:02:50.150 --> 04:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
doing
 
04:02:52.469 --> 04:02:52.479 align:start position:0%
anything to protect domestic violence
 
04:02:54.309 --> 04:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
victims with the gun line
 
04:02:56.070 --> 04:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
because that individual if they want to
 
04:02:57.510 --> 04:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
commit a crime
 
04:02:59.750 --> 04:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
and they are not those records of not
 
04:03:01.590 --> 04:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
being shared with the federal system or
 
04:03:04.150 --> 04:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
with nyx they will simply go in and
 
04:03:07.349 --> 04:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
purchase a long gun and i'm not saying
 
04:03:09.910 --> 04:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
specifically in new hampshire because
 
04:03:11.590 --> 04:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
federal law says
 
04:03:13.830 --> 04:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
as a resident you can go and purchase it
 
04:03:16.309 --> 04:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
in vermont you can go and purchase it
 
04:03:18.150 --> 04:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
you know in maine
 
04:03:18.160 --> 04:03:19.510 align:start position:0%
you know in maine
so

04:03:19.510 --> 04:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:03:22.389 --> 04:03:22.399 align:start position:0%
again i sat here as long
 
04:03:23.910 --> 04:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
along with everyone else here for over
 
04:03:25.830 --> 04:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
four hours hearing about this domestic
 
04:03:27.750 --> 04:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
violence in in in
 
04:03:29.429 --> 04:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
how new hampshire is protecting those
 
04:03:31.189 --> 04:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
victims they are not protecting those
 
04:03:35.030 --> 04:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
victims i'm sorry they are not now do i
 
04:03:37.590 --> 04:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
agree that maybe uh you know the
 
04:03:39.830 --> 04:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
domestic violence victims should
 
04:03:41.830 --> 04:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
make a decision and and want to get
 
04:03:43.590 --> 04:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
training and get a firearm to protect
 
04:03:45.269 --> 04:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
themselves that's entirely up to you
 
04:03:48.150 --> 04:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
that's entirely their choice but to
 
04:03:51.030 --> 04:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
continue to say that new hampshire is
 
04:03:54.630 --> 04:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
protecting domestic violence victims is
 
04:04:01.250 --> 04:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:01.260 --> 04:04:03.349 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
04:04:05.429 --> 04:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:04:07.269 --> 04:04:07.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:04:07.279 --> 04:04:08.389 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

04:04:08.389 --> 04:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:10.389 --> 04:04:10.399 align:start position:0%
we have a single point of contact now
 
04:04:11.750 --> 04:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
with the state
 
04:04:17.189 --> 04:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:17.199 --> 04:04:17.910 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:04:17.910 --> 04:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:04:22.070 --> 04:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:24.630 --> 04:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
rep newman you muted yourself
 
04:04:25.750 --> 04:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
what happened
 
04:04:28.550 --> 04:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
okay let me let me try one more time
 
04:04:30.070 --> 04:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
we have one point of contact in the
 
04:04:31.830 --> 04:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
state right now and this bill would have
 
04:04:33.590 --> 04:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
points of contacts in all the counties
 
04:04:36.710 --> 04:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
in the states however many there are
 
04:04:39.349 --> 04:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
what makes you confident that
 
04:04:41.189 --> 04:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
going through the counties will be more
 
04:04:43.030 --> 04:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
efficient and have less delays than
 
04:04:48.229 --> 04:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:49.910 --> 04:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
um excuse me
 
04:04:50.870 --> 04:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
04:04:50.880 --> 04:04:52.550 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
question

04:04:52.550 --> 04:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:04:55.429 --> 04:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
again if the counties or the state
 
04:04:57.349 --> 04:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
are doing their jobs correctly we
 
04:04:59.910 --> 04:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be having this situation
 
04:05:02.389 --> 04:05:02.399 align:start position:0%
right if the state was
 
04:05:02.399 --> 04:05:03.670 align:start position:0%
right if the state was
efficient

04:05:03.670 --> 04:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
04:05:05.349 --> 04:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
in running a gun line
 
04:05:05.359 --> 04:05:06.550 align:start position:0%
in running a gun line
correctly

04:05:06.550 --> 04:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
04:05:08.710 --> 04:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
but again it's you're doing a double
 
04:05:11.510 --> 04:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
process it's already a taxpayer funded
 
04:05:14.550 --> 04:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
nix is already a tax payer funded system
 
04:05:17.349 --> 04:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
and i would hope
 
04:05:19.189 --> 04:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
and but we do run into this issue
 
04:05:20.870 --> 04:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and we've run into this issue
 
04:05:23.349 --> 04:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
in numerous states where
 
04:05:25.269 --> 04:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
the court systems or the states
 
04:05:27.030 --> 04:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
themselves are not sharing the
 
04:05:28.550 --> 04:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate records with the federal
 
04:05:30.790 --> 04:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
system or with their own internal state
 
04:05:30.800 --> 04:05:31.750 align:start position:0%
system or with their own internal state
system

04:05:31.750 --> 04:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:05:35.110 --> 04:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
so the less bureaucracy we can get
 
04:05:37.429 --> 04:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
probably would be better but i would
 
04:05:39.429 --> 04:05:39.439 align:start position:0%
hope that these court systems and these
 
04:05:41.830 --> 04:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
county courts would be sharing those
 
04:05:43.670 --> 04:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
records that's no different
 
04:05:45.030 --> 04:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
let's look at it this way it's no
 
04:05:47.110 --> 04:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
different than a felon right i would
 
04:05:47.120 --> 04:05:48.150 align:start position:0%
different than a felon right i would
hope

04:05:48.150 --> 04:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
hope
 
04:05:50.710 --> 04:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
i would hope beyond belief that they're
 
04:05:52.389 --> 04:05:52.399 align:start position:0%
sharing that those are convicted of
 
04:05:55.030 --> 04:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
felonies would be sharing those records
 
04:05:57.830 --> 04:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
from the county courts or from the state
 
04:06:00.070 --> 04:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
and if they aren't then we're in a very
 
04:06:08.150 --> 04:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:10.870 --> 04:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
i guess my confusion is we have we say
 
04:06:13.429 --> 04:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
that the gun line's not working but the
 
04:06:16.389 --> 04:06:16.399 align:start position:0%
for the long guns it works
 
04:06:19.750 --> 04:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
why is this build better than
 
04:06:21.990 --> 04:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
doing it exactly the same way we do long
 
04:06:24.070 --> 04:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
guns or am i just confused about what's
 
04:06:26.150 --> 04:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
going on
 
04:06:27.670 --> 04:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh with all due respect representative
 
04:06:29.189 --> 04:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
newman that's exactly what this bill
 
04:06:32.229 --> 04:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
would do it would be make the gun lines
 
04:06:36.070 --> 04:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:36.950 --> 04:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:06:38.469 --> 04:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
04:06:38.479 --> 04:06:49.750 align:start position:0%
yes sir
representative

04:06:49.750 --> 04:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:53.510 --> 04:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and um thank you mr
 
04:06:57.269 --> 04:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
miss mr mc mcgorin i'm sorry it's okay

mcwiggin is fine oh jake don't worry
 
04:07:01.269 --> 04:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:07:03.110 --> 04:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
i appreciate it thank you for the
 
04:07:03.120 --> 04:07:04.309 align:start position:0%
i appreciate it thank you for the
correction

04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
correction
 
04:07:04.319 --> 04:07:05.990 align:start position:0%
correction
um

04:07:05.990 --> 04:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:08.389 --> 04:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
i just want to dial back to
 
04:07:10.950 --> 04:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
um some of the testimony that you just
 
04:07:14.469 --> 04:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
gave or perhaps the answer to a question
 
04:07:17.429 --> 04:07:17.439 align:start position:0%
that you just gave about um domestic
 
04:07:19.590 --> 04:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
violence because it really is
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
um it really is a big concern um for
 
04:07:25.750 --> 04:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
this particular piece of legislation and
 
04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if you were familiar
 
04:07:31.030 --> 04:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
um with the new hampshire statistics i
 
04:07:32.550 --> 04:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
know you gave us some national
 
04:07:35.110 --> 04:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
statistics but according to did you know
 
04:07:38.389 --> 04:07:38.399 align:start position:0%
that um in new hampshire fatality review
 
04:07:40.469 --> 04:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
nine out of ten domestic violence
 
04:07:41.830 --> 04:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
homicides are
 
04:07:45.030 --> 04:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
are caused by firearms um and those are
 
04:07:46.710 --> 04:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
handguns and
 
04:07:49.990 --> 04:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
so 50 of the firearm deaths
 
04:07:52.389 --> 04:07:52.399 align:start position:0%
of the of that only one in ten are
 
04:07:56.309 --> 04:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
caused by long guns so um we
 
04:07:58.950 --> 04:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
we really do want to make sure that we
 
04:08:02.710 --> 04:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
are not creating a massive loophole um
 
04:08:06.229 --> 04:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:08.070 --> 04:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
representative i i appreciate i
 
04:08:10.309 --> 04:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question but as you know
 
04:08:11.990 --> 04:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
if if somebody is
 
04:08:14.950 --> 04:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
um bent on committing a crime and let's
 
04:08:16.389 --> 04:08:16.399 align:start position:0%
assume that
 
04:08:18.710 --> 04:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
you know the gun line was not doing its
 
04:08:20.710 --> 04:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
job of vice versa they're going to find
 
04:08:22.950 --> 04:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
other means to to commit it and you know
 
04:08:25.670 --> 04:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
commit the crime unfortunately um you
 
04:08:27.670 --> 04:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
know i do point to many of the
 
04:08:29.830 --> 04:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
statistics um from the department of
 
04:08:31.269 --> 04:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
justice on the federal level dealing
 
04:08:32.630 --> 04:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
with criminals right i mean if you're
 
04:08:35.110 --> 04:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
going to be a criminal you are more than
 
04:08:38.389 --> 04:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
happy to see um you know further uh gun
 
04:08:40.389 --> 04:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
control policies put into place because
 
04:08:43.110 --> 04:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to limit those you know
 
04:08:45.030 --> 04:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
you know law-abiding citizens to to
 
04:08:47.349 --> 04:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
exercise their rights so
 
04:08:48.710 --> 04:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
yes if
 
04:08:50.309 --> 04:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
let's assume there is an individual
 
04:08:52.870 --> 04:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
where the gun gun line does stop that
 
04:08:55.110 --> 04:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
domestic violence from happening
 
04:08:57.189 --> 04:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
then that person would
 
04:08:59.269 --> 04:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
go the next door and buy a buy a rifle
 
04:09:02.309 --> 04:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
or shotgun unfortunately
 
04:09:02.319 --> 04:09:03.510 align:start position:0%
or shotgun unfortunately
and

04:09:03.510 --> 04:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:09:03.520 --> 04:09:04.469 align:start position:0%
and
if

04:09:04.469 --> 04:09:04.479 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:09:06.229 --> 04:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
the stats that you are saying are
 
04:09:08.870 --> 04:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
correct that 9 out of 10
 
04:09:11.349 --> 04:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire then obviously the gun
 
04:09:15.269 --> 04:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:17.030 --> 04:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
because they should have already been
 
04:09:19.990 --> 04:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
denied their purchase of their handgun
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
if they did have temporary restraining
 
04:09:23.590 --> 04:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
orders so nine out of ten crimes would
 
04:09:25.990 --> 04:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
not be committed with a handgun
 
04:09:30.309 --> 04:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:31.990 --> 04:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
so you know forever andreas i want to
 
04:09:33.349 --> 04:09:33.359 align:start position:0%

04:09:35.189 --> 04:09:35.199 align:start position:0%

04:11:03.189 --> 04:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
disinformation in one hearing as i've
 
04:11:04.550 --> 04:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
heard today
 
04:11:06.389 --> 04:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
i can't possibly in three minutes
 
04:11:08.710 --> 04:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
address all of the errors
 
04:11:13.269 --> 04:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
uh but the representative from the nssf
 
04:11:17.110 --> 04:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
is categorically wrong when he said that
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
quote of 4473 is good for 30 days
 
04:11:24.389 --> 04:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
if a person fills out that form
 
04:11:27.269 --> 04:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
and is called away from the dealer
 
04:11:30.309 --> 04:11:30.319 align:start position:0%
the dealer calls and gets an approval
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
that approval is good for 30 days
 
04:11:37.349 --> 04:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
but if the dealer never calls in
 
04:11:40.389 --> 04:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
the request for a background check the
 
04:11:43.750 --> 04:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
contents of that form are valid until
 
04:11:45.910 --> 04:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
the dealer calls it in
 
04:11:45.920 --> 04:11:46.710 align:start position:0%
the dealer calls it in
so

04:11:46.710 --> 04:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:49.269 --> 04:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
therefore if a person fills in the form
 
04:11:51.750 --> 04:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
and leaves and goes off for months and
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
months and the dealer doesn't call it
 
04:11:56.710 --> 04:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
until the person returns let's own the
 
04:11:59.030 --> 04:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
form is perfectly fine
 
04:12:01.429 --> 04:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
there's a specific box on the form to be
 
04:12:02.389 --> 04:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
filled in
 
04:12:05.910 --> 04:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
if once an approval is received there is
 
04:12:07.750 --> 04:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
then a delay
 
04:12:10.630 --> 04:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
in the turning over the firearm then the
 
04:12:13.910 --> 04:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
person has 30 days after the dealer
 
04:12:16.309 --> 04:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
calls it in to come back to the dealer
 
04:12:19.030 --> 04:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
and complete the transaction
 
04:12:19.040 --> 04:12:20.070 align:start position:0%
and complete the transaction
a

04:12:20.070 --> 04:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:12:21.590 --> 04:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
couple of other issues i'd like to
 
04:12:24.469 --> 04:12:24.479 align:start position:0%
address i will send in testimony
 
04:12:27.030 --> 04:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
at the end of 2018 according to
 
04:12:29.269 --> 04:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
department of justice statistics
 
04:12:31.429 --> 04:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
published in firearms commerce in the
 
04:12:34.790 --> 04:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
united states there were about 423
 
04:12:38.150 --> 04:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
million firearms in the u.s excluding
 
04:12:40.070 --> 04:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
military items
 
04:12:42.870 --> 04:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
the idea that has been suggested to you
 
04:12:44.790 --> 04:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
that if someone is denied they do not
 
04:12:47.429 --> 04:12:47.439 align:start position:0%
get a firearm is
 
04:12:49.189 --> 04:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
simply wrong
 
04:12:51.590 --> 04:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
there are so many firearms available
 
04:12:53.590 --> 04:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
that a person who is determined to get
 
04:12:56.550 --> 04:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
one and who is denied will get one they
 
04:12:58.550 --> 04:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
just won't get one from a licensed
 
04:12:58.560 --> 04:13:00.630 align:start position:0%
just won't get one from a licensed
dealer

04:13:00.630 --> 04:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
dealer
 
04:13:05.590 --> 04:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
now turning to the core issue at hand
 
04:13:07.110 --> 04:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
only those who believe that the
 
04:13:09.590 --> 04:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner of public safety is a liar
 
04:13:11.189 --> 04:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
and a cheat
 
04:13:13.910 --> 04:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
would have the gall to state to you
 
04:13:16.550 --> 04:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
that if it weren't for this bill
 
04:13:19.189 --> 04:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
this would never the long delays caused
 
04:13:21.510 --> 04:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
by a rogue employee would never have
 
04:13:23.110 --> 04:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
been fixed
 
04:13:25.189 --> 04:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
not so
 
04:13:27.189 --> 04:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
i think commissioner quinn is a truthful
 
04:13:27.199 --> 04:13:28.870 align:start position:0%
i think commissioner quinn is a truthful
man

04:13:28.870 --> 04:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
man
 
04:13:30.710 --> 04:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
04:13:32.389 --> 04:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
the improvements to the process that
 
04:13:35.349 --> 04:13:35.359 align:start position:0%
have been made will be lasting
 
04:13:35.359 --> 04:13:36.389 align:start position:0%
have been made will be lasting
the

04:13:36.389 --> 04:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:13:39.110 --> 04:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
concept that fbi nix is bulletproof is
 
04:13:42.309 --> 04:13:42.319 align:start position:0%
wrong i will send to you a copy of an
 
04:13:44.790 --> 04:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
email that i got as a dealer from fbi
 
04:13:48.710 --> 04:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
nix on 19 march 2021
 
04:13:51.349 --> 04:13:51.359 align:start position:0%
saying that because of the volume of
 
04:13:53.830 --> 04:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
clearance requests you will encounter
 
04:13:57.670 --> 04:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
delays when you call fbi nics
 
04:13:57.680 --> 04:13:59.990 align:start position:0%
delays when you call fbi nics
the

04:13:59.990 --> 04:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:02.309 --> 04:14:02.319 align:start position:0%
i'll call it the firearm a feeding
 
04:14:02.319 --> 04:14:03.670 align:start position:0%
i'll call it the firearm a feeding
frenzy

04:14:03.670 --> 04:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
frenzy
 
04:14:07.349 --> 04:14:07.359 align:start position:0%
goes on at a slightly more moderate pace
 
04:14:10.469 --> 04:14:10.479 align:start position:0%
than it did in 2020
 
04:14:14.710 --> 04:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:17.550 --> 04:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
approved or at least processed
 
04:14:21.910 --> 04:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
39.7 million requests a 40.3 percent
 
04:14:23.990 --> 04:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
rise over
 
04:14:28.469 --> 04:14:28.479 align:start position:0%
2019. for the first three months of 2021
 
04:14:31.189 --> 04:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
they the number of requests
 
04:14:33.030 --> 04:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
is 36
 
04:14:35.750 --> 04:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
up on 2020
 
04:14:38.550 --> 04:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
and these are data released by fbi nics
 
04:14:40.950 --> 04:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
they release them every month
 
04:14:45.269 --> 04:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
so in short fbi nix is not bulletproof
 
04:14:48.149 --> 04:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
the other thing that you were not told
 
04:14:51.189 --> 04:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
is that for those who have a security
 
04:14:53.670 --> 04:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
clearance or have had a security
 
04:14:56.710 --> 04:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
clearance they will often be delayed
 
04:14:58.710 --> 04:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
by fbi nics
 
04:15:02.229 --> 04:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
if there is not at the fbi nick center
 
04:15:05.110 --> 04:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
a person with a security clearance
 
04:15:08.309 --> 04:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
sufficient to allow them to look at
 
04:15:10.870 --> 04:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
the records of someone who say was a
 
04:15:13.750 --> 04:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
seal or a member of delta force the
 
04:15:16.710 --> 04:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
first line agents at fbi nick center and
 
04:15:18.950 --> 04:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
by the way these are contractors these
 
04:15:21.990 --> 04:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
are not government employees cannot look
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
at certain records
 
04:15:24.479 --> 04:15:25.349 align:start position:0%
at certain records
so

04:15:25.349 --> 04:15:25.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:15:28.389 --> 04:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
after 20 years of war in southwest asia
 
04:15:30.149 --> 04:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
there are more americans and by
 
04:15:32.790 --> 04:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
definition more new hampshire residents
 
04:15:35.750 --> 04:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
who have held security clearances
 
04:15:38.469 --> 04:15:38.479 align:start position:0%
and who are more likely to get delayed
 
04:15:40.229 --> 04:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
by fbi nics
 
04:15:41.830 --> 04:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire does not
 
04:15:43.910 --> 04:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
delay such persons
 
04:15:45.750 --> 04:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
because the folks who do these
 
04:15:47.830 --> 04:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
background checks are state of new
 
04:15:50.710 --> 04:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire employees we presume them to
 
04:15:52.630 --> 04:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
be honest and upright
 
04:15:54.550 --> 04:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
and they mostly are
 
04:15:56.710 --> 04:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
and therefore they can look at all the
 
04:15:59.429 --> 04:15:59.439 align:start position:0%
relevant records
 
04:16:02.149 --> 04:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
one point i'd also like to address
 
04:16:03.269 --> 04:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:16:05.429 --> 04:16:05.439 align:start position:0%
for victims of domestic domestic
 
04:16:05.439 --> 04:16:06.710 align:start position:0%
for victims of domestic domestic
violence

04:16:06.710 --> 04:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
violence
 
04:16:08.389 --> 04:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
there seems to be an assumption that
 
04:16:10.950 --> 04:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
they are somehow entitled to protection
 
04:16:14.229 --> 04:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
this is not u.s law here's the law in
 
04:16:16.229 --> 04:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
the words of
 
04:16:17.590 --> 04:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
a federal
 
04:16:19.269 --> 04:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
circuit court
 
04:16:21.429 --> 04:16:21.439 align:start position:0%
but there is no constitutional right to
 
04:16:24.070 --> 04:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
be protected by the state against being
 
04:16:26.469 --> 04:16:26.479 align:start position:0%
murdered by criminals or madmen
 
04:16:28.950 --> 04:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
it is monstrous if the state fails to
 
04:16:30.790 --> 04:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
protect its residents against such
 
04:16:33.189 --> 04:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
predators but it does not violate the
 
04:16:35.830 --> 04:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
due process clause of the 14th amendment
 
04:16:38.630 --> 04:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
or we suppose any other provision of the
 
04:16:38.640 --> 04:16:40.229 align:start position:0%
or we suppose any other provision of the
constitution

04:16:56.389 --> 04:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
my point is
 
04:16:58.550 --> 04:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
those who have been victims
 
04:16:58.560 --> 04:16:59.910 align:start position:0%
those who have been victims
of

04:16:59.910 --> 04:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:17:02.950 --> 04:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
domestic partners who are violent
 
04:17:06.389 --> 04:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
should not look to the state
 
04:17:08.830 --> 04:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
because they do
 
04:17:10.950 --> 04:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
not yet
 
04:17:13.349 --> 04:17:13.359 align:start position:0%

it's a friendly reminder your

testimony is limited to three minutes
 
04:17:54.469 --> 04:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
i just simply want to say that as long
 
04:17:56.630 --> 04:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
as uh the dealers are given a choice
 
04:17:59.189 --> 04:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
between the knicks and the

orders are
 
04:24:10.550 --> 04:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
are written as directives in the present
 
04:24:12.389 --> 04:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
united states that manage the operations
 
04:24:13.910 --> 04:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
of the federal government
 
04:24:15.670 --> 04:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
they don't have a mandate on state
 
04:24:18.469 --> 04:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
governments and what their agents are
 
04:24:20.149 --> 04:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
supposed to do he's not the chief
 
04:24:22.309 --> 04:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
executive of states
 
04:24:23.670 --> 04:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
governments and
 
04:24:23.680 --> 04:24:24.710 align:start position:0%
governments and
officers

04:24:24.710 --> 04:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
officers
 
04:24:26.389 --> 04:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
congress and legislators can pass
 
04:24:27.830 --> 04:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
legislation that can make it difficult
 
04:24:29.750 --> 04:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
or even impossible to carry out that
 
04:24:31.269 --> 04:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
order the federal level they can remove
 
04:24:33.429 --> 04:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
funding in the congress at the state
 
04:24:35.670 --> 04:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
level they can forbid or prohibit
 
04:24:37.590 --> 04:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
members acting as agents of the state
 
04:24:40.309 --> 04:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
from following those directives or
 
04:24:41.830 --> 04:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
regulations that are imposed by
 
04:24:43.510 --> 04:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
executive order
 
04:24:46.309 --> 04:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
um recently there was a uh
 
04:24:48.710 --> 04:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
an opinion done about the bum stock ban
 
04:24:50.830 --> 04:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
that and our former president
 
04:24:51.990 --> 04:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
had um
 
04:24:54.630 --> 04:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
issued an order to direct the atf and
 
04:24:56.070 --> 04:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
atfe to
 
04:24:59.269 --> 04:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
ban the possession of bump stocks well
 
04:25:00.790 --> 04:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
it was upheld in several lower courts
 
04:25:03.269 --> 04:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
but the sixth circuit in michigan ruled
 
04:25:04.790 --> 04:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
last month
 
04:25:06.469 --> 04:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
04:25:08.710 --> 04:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
it was they were not able to arbitrarily
 
04:25:11.349 --> 04:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
or unilaterally rewrite their own rule
 
04:25:12.550 --> 04:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
because they thought it was
 
04:25:14.950 --> 04:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional it's not their they
 
04:25:16.309 --> 04:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
said that it is not the role of the
 
04:25:18.149 --> 04:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
executive branch to dictate to the
 
04:25:20.309 --> 04:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
public what is right and wrong the
 
04:25:21.990 --> 04:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
judgments are reserved to the people
 
04:25:23.429 --> 04:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
through their dilected
 
04:25:26.550 --> 04:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
duly elected representatives in congress
 
04:25:29.429 --> 04:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
so i think that uh states not following
 
04:25:32.070 --> 04:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh executive orders at the federal level
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
which are not intended for them to
 
04:25:35.830 --> 04:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
follow anyway is not only necessary but
 
04:25:37.189 --> 04:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
it's a reasonable
 
04:25:37.199 --> 04:25:38.309 align:start position:0%
it's a reasonable
um

04:25:38.309 --> 04:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:40.389 --> 04:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
decision that is sending a strong
 
04:25:42.229 --> 04:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
message that we will not comply in new
 
04:25:45.030 --> 04:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire with arbitrary orders that are
 
04:25:47.030 --> 04:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
not passed through congress
 
04:25:51.910 --> 04:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:53.429 --> 04:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:25:55.429 --> 04:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:25:57.110 --> 04:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised i want to thank
 
04:25:58.469 --> 04:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
the witness for
 
04:26:00.229 --> 04:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
his testimony
 
04:26:03.429 --> 04:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair recognized uh
 
04:26:07.990 --> 04:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:11.110 --> 04:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon can you hear me okay
 
04:26:13.110 --> 04:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
yes we can hear and uh
 
04:26:15.590 --> 04:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
we apologize if we're behind schedule
 
04:26:16.790 --> 04:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
04:26:19.590 --> 04:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
i know the previous bill had people had
 
04:26:22.550 --> 04:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
lots of a lot to say thank you for
 
04:26:25.349 --> 04:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify i'm opposed to
 
04:26:28.309 --> 04:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
this bill and i would like to tell you
 
04:26:28.319 --> 04:26:29.670 align:start position:0%
this bill and i would like to tell you
why

04:26:29.670 --> 04:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:26:31.990 --> 04:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
and i also want to clarify i'm coming to
 
04:26:34.070 --> 04:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
you as a member of the public as a
 
04:26:36.950 --> 04:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
mother as a grandmother and yes i am a
 
04:26:39.590 --> 04:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
resident of hanover but i hope you will
 
04:26:42.309 --> 04:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
not disqualify what i have to say
 
04:26:45.750 --> 04:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
because i come from a very liberal town
 
04:26:45.760 --> 04:26:47.030 align:start position:0%
because i come from a very liberal town
um

04:26:47.030 --> 04:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:48.870 --> 04:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
so here are the points i'd like to make
 
04:26:52.149 --> 04:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
about this bill and why i'm opposed um i
 
04:26:53.429 --> 04:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
think some of
 
04:26:56.630 --> 04:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
i think we need to clarify some of our
 
04:26:56.640 --> 04:26:57.590 align:start position:0%
i think we need to clarify some of our
um

04:26:57.590 --> 04:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:59.910 --> 04:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
assumptions behind what we're talking
 
04:26:59.920 --> 04:27:00.790 align:start position:0%
assumptions behind what we're talking
about

04:27:00.790 --> 04:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:27:00.800 --> 04:27:01.670 align:start position:0%
about
so

04:27:01.670 --> 04:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:27:04.710 --> 04:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
i'm clarifying owning a firearm is
 
04:27:07.030 --> 04:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely your right
 
04:27:10.830 --> 04:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
the issue here is not about owning a
 
04:27:13.269 --> 04:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
firearm it's not about the second
 
04:27:15.910 --> 04:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
amendment right the issue is gun
 
04:27:18.229 --> 04:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
violence in this country
 
04:27:21.349 --> 04:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
so the goal of any federal legislation
 
04:27:24.070 --> 04:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
or presidential executive order on
 
04:27:28.389 --> 04:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
firearms is to reduce gun violence
 
04:27:31.189 --> 04:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
if we only focus on the right to bear
 
04:27:34.870 --> 04:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
arms then we are not doing anything
 
04:27:37.269 --> 04:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
about preventing gun violence and the
 
04:27:39.269 --> 04:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
mass shootings that have recently
 
04:27:43.830 --> 04:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:47.590 --> 04:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
sb 154 takes issue with any executive
 
04:27:49.750 --> 04:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
order on firearms issued by the
 
04:27:52.149 --> 04:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
president of the united states
 
04:27:55.910 --> 04:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
yet hb 307 i know that's not an issue at
 
04:27:56.950 --> 04:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
the moment
 
04:28:00.990 --> 04:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
hb 307 takes issue with local schools or
 
04:28:03.910 --> 04:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities making a decision on
 
04:28:06.229 --> 04:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
firearms because we're not a home rule
 
04:28:06.239 --> 04:28:07.269 align:start position:0%
firearms because we're not a home rule
state

04:28:07.269 --> 04:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:28:07.279 --> 04:28:08.630 align:start position:0%
state
so

04:28:08.630 --> 04:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:28:11.030 --> 04:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
does this mean that the state of new
 
04:28:13.670 --> 04:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire will be the only entity that
 
04:28:16.389 --> 04:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
can rule on firearms in the granite
 
04:28:16.399 --> 04:28:17.670 align:start position:0%
can rule on firearms in the granite
state

04:28:17.670 --> 04:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:28:20.550 --> 04:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
do we pick and choose who makes the
 
04:28:22.950 --> 04:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
decision who has the authority to make
 
04:28:26.229 --> 04:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
the decisions on firearms i for one
 
04:28:30.710 --> 04:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:33.670 --> 04:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
my other my final thought is
 
04:28:34.870 --> 04:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
04:28:37.830 --> 04:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
having this discussion about gun owners
 
04:28:37.840 --> 04:28:39.030 align:start position:0%
having this discussion about gun owners
rights

04:28:39.030 --> 04:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
rights
 
04:28:42.070 --> 04:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
why can't we just join forces and work
 
04:28:45.110 --> 04:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
together and find ways to reduce gun
 
04:28:48.149 --> 04:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
violence i really appreciate your time
 
04:28:52.149 --> 04:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:56.790 --> 04:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:58.710 --> 04:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
all right see no andre the witnesses
 
04:29:01.830 --> 04:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you
 
04:29:17.110 --> 04:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:19.670 --> 04:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
video it still says senate bill
 
04:29:19.680 --> 04:29:20.530 align:start position:0%
video it still says senate bill
141

04:29:20.530 --> 04:29:20.540 align:start position:0%
141
 
04:29:20.540 --> 04:29:21.830 align:start position:0%

[Music]

04:29:21.830 --> 04:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:29:22.950 --> 04:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
that could be up
 
04:29:25.030 --> 04:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
to the update so don't
 
04:29:25.040 --> 04:29:35.990 align:start position:0%
to the update so don't
confusion

04:29:35.990 --> 04:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:38.149 --> 04:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair recognizes dr
 
04:29:45.590 --> 04:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:59.030 --> 04:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:59.040 --> 04:30:14.630 align:start position:0%
 
mr patience

04:30:14.630 --> 04:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:16.070 --> 04:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
well that's being worked out the chair
 
04:30:19.269 --> 04:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
will now recognize aaron
 
04:30:19.279 --> 04:30:36.870 align:start position:0%
will now recognize aaron
um

04:30:36.870 --> 04:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:36.880 --> 04:30:42.950 align:start position:0%
 
alright

04:30:42.950 --> 04:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:45.910 --> 04:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
just this time the chair now recognize
 
04:30:51.269 --> 04:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:52.630 --> 04:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
hi can you hear me
 
04:30:54.149 --> 04:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
yes we can hear you
 
04:30:55.830 --> 04:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
great please ignore the moana music
 
04:30:57.590 --> 04:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
downstairs from the kids
 
04:30:59.269 --> 04:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
my name is andrew hawkins i'm the
 
04:31:01.110 --> 04:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
director of gun sense new hampshire a
 
04:31:03.110 --> 04:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
project of granite state progress i'm
 
04:31:04.790 --> 04:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
here today to testify in opposition to
 
04:31:08.070 --> 04:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
senate bill 154 let's be honest this
 
04:31:09.590 --> 04:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
bill is not about protecting second
 
04:31:11.429 --> 04:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
amendment rights it's about preserving
 
04:31:13.429 --> 04:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
the corporate gun lobby's ability to
 
04:31:15.269 --> 04:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
increase profits off the murder of
 
04:31:17.030 --> 04:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
american families
 
04:31:18.790 --> 04:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
mass shootings fill our new cycle each
 
04:31:20.870 --> 04:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
week and we shake our heads and some of
 
04:31:22.630 --> 04:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
you have the audacity to offer thoughts
 
04:31:25.030 --> 04:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
and prayers instead of concrete action
 
04:31:26.790 --> 04:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
now the biden administration and leaders
 
04:31:28.950 --> 04:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
in congress are working urgently to save
 
04:31:31.269 --> 04:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
lives and the response by some new
 
04:31:33.590 --> 04:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire politicians is to find ways to
 
04:31:36.550 --> 04:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
block stop and delay those efforts even
 
04:31:37.910 --> 04:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
though it will cost lives and even
 
04:31:39.670 --> 04:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
though we should all be able to agree
 
04:31:41.110 --> 04:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
that our family shouldn't have to live
 
04:31:43.750 --> 04:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
in fear of going to the grocery store or
 
04:31:45.750 --> 04:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
to work or to school or to the movie
 
04:31:47.830 --> 04:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
theater or to a health clinic or a
 
04:31:49.990 --> 04:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
bowling alley or walking down the street
 
04:31:52.309 --> 04:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
in our community or playing in the park
 
04:31:54.710 --> 04:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
or living in our homes because dangerous
 
04:31:57.349 --> 04:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
individuals can easily access firearms
 
04:31:59.670 --> 04:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
and shoot and kill our families
 
04:32:01.110 --> 04:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
let's sign aside for the moment that
 
04:32:03.349 --> 04:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
senate bill 154 and the proposed
 
04:32:05.590 --> 04:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
amendment are likely unconstitutional
 
04:32:07.269 --> 04:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
that it could cost new hampshire to lose
 
04:32:08.790 --> 04:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars in
 
04:32:10.710 --> 04:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
federal grants and aid and it is
 
04:32:13.429 --> 04:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
completely absurd to block public safety
 
04:32:13.439 --> 04:32:14.309 align:start position:0%
completely absurd to block public safety
laws

04:32:14.309 --> 04:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
laws
 
04:32:16.469 --> 04:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
here are some of the things that this
 
04:32:18.469 --> 04:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
bill proposes to stop
 
04:32:21.189 --> 04:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
the biden harris administration
 
04:32:22.870 --> 04:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
has directed the justice department to
 
04:32:24.950 --> 04:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
issue a proposed rule to help stop the
 
04:32:27.429 --> 04:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
proliferation of ghost guns as more
 
04:32:29.590 --> 04:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
criminals buy kids to assemble firearms
 
04:32:31.750 --> 04:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
in as little as 30 minutes to commit
 
04:32:33.189 --> 04:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
crimes that cannot be traced to the
 
04:32:36.070 --> 04:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
weapon this proposed rule will help stop
 
04:32:38.870 --> 04:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
the proliferation of these firearms
 
04:32:41.349 --> 04:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
they will issue a proposed rule to make
 
04:32:42.870 --> 04:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
clear that devices marketed as a
 
04:32:45.189 --> 04:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
stabling race like those purchased by
 
04:32:47.590 --> 04:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
the shooter in the boulder mass shooting
 
04:32:50.309 --> 04:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
are subject to the national firearms act
 
04:32:51.910 --> 04:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
they'll publish model red flag
 
04:32:53.990 --> 04:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
legislation for states that will make it
 
04:32:56.469 --> 04:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
easier for states to adopt red flag laws
 
04:32:57.990 --> 04:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
which allow family members of law
 
04:33:00.070 --> 04:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement to petition for a court
 
04:33:01.830 --> 04:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
order temporarily barring people in
 
04:33:04.551 --> 04:33:04.561 align:start position:0%
crisis from accessing firearms if they
 
04:33:06.310 --> 04:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
are present
 
04:33:08.310 --> 04:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
a danger to themselves or others these
 
04:33:09.990 --> 04:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
are the types of measures that we would
 
04:33:11.269 --> 04:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
always hear
 
04:33:13.029 --> 04:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
would have been helpful before a mass
 
04:33:13.039 --> 04:33:14.470 align:start position:0%
would have been helpful before a mass
shooting

04:33:14.470 --> 04:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
shooting
 
04:33:15.830 --> 04:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
the justice department will issue an
 
04:33:18.709 --> 04:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
annual report on firearms trafficking
 
04:33:20.789 --> 04:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a net exporter of crime
 
04:33:20.799 --> 04:33:21.910 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a net exporter of crime
guns

04:33:21.910 --> 04:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
guns
 
04:33:23.590 --> 04:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
they're looking at evidence-based
 
04:33:25.429 --> 04:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
community violence interventions
 
04:33:27.349 --> 04:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
improving strategies for reducing gun
 
04:33:29.750 --> 04:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
violence and funding to help with those
 
04:33:32.070 --> 04:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
community violence interventions
 
04:33:33.750 --> 04:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
does governor sununu and this
 
04:33:35.429 --> 04:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
legislative body want to turn down
 
04:33:37.109 --> 04:33:37.119 align:start position:0%
federal dollars that could benefit new
 
04:33:40.070 --> 04:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire from this source or others
 
04:33:41.189 --> 04:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
mrs hawkins
 
04:33:43.349 --> 04:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
we did limit testimony to one minute per
 
04:33:45.510 --> 04:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
person um
 
04:33:46.949 --> 04:33:46.959 align:start position:0%
a lot of people signed the testimony i
 
04:33:48.949 --> 04:33:48.959 align:start position:0%
have uh appeared to have not been able
 
04:33:51.590 --> 04:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
to stay but i am going to ask you if you
 
04:33:52.869 --> 04:33:52.879 align:start position:0%
can just wrap up your testimonies
 
04:33:54.230 --> 04:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
members will be permitted to still ask
 
04:34:02.150 --> 04:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:05.109 --> 04:34:05.119 align:start position:0%
thank you sb 154 would also jeopardize
 
04:34:06.869 --> 04:34:06.879 align:start position:0%
public safety in other ways preventing
 
04:34:08.869 --> 04:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
state work with atf the department of
 
04:34:10.789 --> 04:34:10.799 align:start position:0%
justice or fbi
 
04:34:12.709 --> 04:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
a couple of examples here would new
 
04:34:14.070 --> 04:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire law enforcement not be
 
04:34:15.750 --> 04:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
permitted to cooperate with doj
 
04:34:17.990 --> 04:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
investigations on extremist white
 
04:34:20.070 --> 04:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
national groups or militias in the state
 
04:34:22.230 --> 04:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
when firearms are involved creating
 
04:34:23.590 --> 04:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
further harm for granted staters of
 
04:34:25.910 --> 04:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
color and others targeted by hate crimes
 
04:34:27.189 --> 04:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
would it limit the ability to hold
 
04:34:28.629 --> 04:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
accountable granite staters who
 
04:34:30.310 --> 04:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
participated in the violent insurrection
 
04:34:32.070 --> 04:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
in washington d.c
 
04:34:33.910 --> 04:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
governor sununu famously had to cancel
 
04:34:35.590 --> 04:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
his public inauguration earlier this
 
04:34:38.070 --> 04:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
year over fears of armed protesters just
 
04:34:39.670 --> 04:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
months after an armed militia in another
 
04:34:41.510 --> 04:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
state hatched a plan to kidnap the
 
04:34:42.789 --> 04:34:42.799 align:start position:0%
governor of michigan
 
04:34:44.949 --> 04:34:44.959 align:start position:0%
yes cinema 154 could prevent the state
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire from
 
04:34:48.150 --> 04:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
miss august you still have to conclude
 
04:34:58.789 --> 04:34:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:00.789 --> 04:35:00.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:35:02.949 --> 04:35:02.959 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:35:04.390 --> 04:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things you mentioned earlier
 
04:35:07.029 --> 04:35:07.039 align:start position:0%
in your testimony was the fact that
 
04:35:09.349 --> 04:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
there are some things about uh this
 
04:35:12.310 --> 04:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
particular bill um that may not pass
 
04:35:15.109 --> 04:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
muster from a constitutional
 
04:35:17.429 --> 04:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
uh uh standpoint i know that's one of
 
04:35:18.789 --> 04:35:18.799 align:start position:0%
the things i think a lot of people are
 
04:35:21.109 --> 04:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
interested in is you know does a state
 
04:35:22.629 --> 04:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
like the state of new hampshire actually
 
04:35:23.830 --> 04:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
have the power
 
04:35:25.910 --> 04:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh to basically
 
04:35:25.920 --> 04:35:26.869 align:start position:0%
uh to basically
say

04:35:26.869 --> 04:35:26.879 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:35:29.269 --> 04:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do that um if
 
04:35:32.150 --> 04:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
congress passes a law or the um
 
04:35:45.109 --> 04:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:46.949 --> 04:35:46.959 align:start position:0%
i'm miss hawkins your mutations please
 
04:35:48.709 --> 04:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
don't meet yourself
 
04:35:50.551 --> 04:35:50.561 align:start position:0%
thank you that just came through uh it's
 
04:35:52.310 --> 04:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
an excellent question i think that this
 
04:35:56.230 --> 04:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
um this proposal has a lot of uh
 
04:35:58.230 --> 04:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
reasons why it would end up in a lawsuit
 
04:36:00.470 --> 04:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
costing the state of new hampshire
 
04:36:01.910 --> 04:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of money and at the same time it
 
04:36:03.349 --> 04:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
would really prevent our state from
 
04:36:05.109 --> 04:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
upholding public safety laws that we do
 
04:36:07.189 --> 04:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
have from the books or accessing federal
 
04:36:09.269 --> 04:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
grants or participating in really
 
04:36:09.279 --> 04:36:10.230 align:start position:0%
grants or participating in really
important

04:36:10.230 --> 04:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:36:11.910 --> 04:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
conversations across state and federal
 
04:36:11.920 --> 04:36:14.949 align:start position:0%
conversations across state and federal
agencies

04:36:14.949 --> 04:36:14.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:19.590 --> 04:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:21.910 --> 04:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
representing your student follow-up plan
 
04:36:23.990 --> 04:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
no no follow-up thank you
 
04:36:26.070 --> 04:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
representative you are recognized for a
 
04:36:26.080 --> 04:36:29.830 align:start position:0%
representative you are recognized for a
question

04:36:29.830 --> 04:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:32.551 --> 04:36:32.561 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair um thank
 
04:36:35.830 --> 04:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
you miss rice hawkins for your testimony
 
04:36:35.840 --> 04:36:36.869 align:start position:0%
you miss rice hawkins for your testimony
um

04:36:36.869 --> 04:36:36.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:39.750 --> 04:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering about um the effective
 
04:36:39.760 --> 04:36:40.709 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering about um the effective
date

04:36:40.709 --> 04:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
date
 
04:36:42.789 --> 04:36:42.799 align:start position:0%
like how would this
 
04:36:45.109 --> 04:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
how would this impact the the state of
 
04:36:46.470 --> 04:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:36:48.789 --> 04:36:48.799 align:start position:0%
um if it were to
 
04:36:53.029 --> 04:36:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:54.070 --> 04:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
it's a great question about the
 
04:36:56.629 --> 04:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
enactment date we did notice um so there
 
04:36:58.230 --> 04:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
we understand there's an amendment and
 
04:36:59.990 --> 04:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
in the amendment we saw that it removes
 
04:37:01.990 --> 04:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
the enactment date which leads us to
 
04:37:03.429 --> 04:37:03.439 align:start position:0%
wonder whether or not
 
04:37:05.269 --> 04:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
those putting that forward are actually
 
04:37:07.590 --> 04:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
looking to have
 
04:37:09.189 --> 04:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
any kind of
 
04:37:11.349 --> 04:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
retroactive effect on any arrests or
 
04:37:13.510 --> 04:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
sentences that have already taken place
 
04:37:15.109 --> 04:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
and we do wonder if it could result in
 
04:37:16.869 --> 04:37:16.879 align:start position:0%
appeals that would lead to convicted
 
04:37:20.709 --> 04:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:24.230 --> 04:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
may i have a follow-up mr chair
 
04:37:26.470 --> 04:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative also you're recognized by
 
04:37:29.750 --> 04:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up questions thank you very much
 
04:37:32.551 --> 04:37:32.561 align:start position:0%
uh miss maurice hawkins um will there
 
04:37:35.109 --> 04:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
what kind of impact who who will be
 
04:37:37.349 --> 04:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
impacted by this and
 
04:37:39.910 --> 04:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me like what would
 
04:37:43.429 --> 04:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
happen to armed militias in this state
 
04:37:45.429 --> 04:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
that have
 
04:37:45.439 --> 04:37:47.670 align:start position:0%
that have
coalesced

04:37:47.670 --> 04:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
coalesced
 
04:37:49.349 --> 04:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for asking that
 
04:37:51.750 --> 04:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
because armed militia activity has been
 
04:37:53.750 --> 04:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
growing across new hampshire as well as
 
04:37:55.590 --> 04:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
white supremacist activity it's
 
04:37:57.349 --> 04:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
something we're very concerned about our
 
04:37:59.189 --> 04:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
organization has been
 
04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
raising the alarm on it for over a year
 
04:38:03.429 --> 04:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
now and you saw that really come to a
 
04:38:05.510 --> 04:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
head around some of the activities down
 
04:38:08.150 --> 04:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
in dc with the violent insurrection as
 
04:38:10.230 --> 04:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
well as governor sununu as i mentioned
 
04:38:12.551 --> 04:38:12.561 align:start position:0%
having to cancel his public inauguration
 
04:38:14.789 --> 04:38:14.799 align:start position:0%
earlier this year over fears of armed
 
04:38:14.799 --> 04:38:16.150 align:start position:0%
earlier this year over fears of armed
protesters

04:38:16.150 --> 04:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
protesters
 
04:38:19.510 --> 04:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
this is a very real situation and a
 
04:38:21.750 --> 04:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
policy like senate bill 154 could really
 
04:38:23.830 --> 04:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
limit the ability for us to proactively
 
04:38:26.150 --> 04:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
address or in the unfortunate
 
04:38:29.269 --> 04:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
circumstances of activity that happens
 
04:38:31.910 --> 04:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
hold accountable those bad actors who
 
04:38:34.551 --> 04:38:34.561 align:start position:0%
are threatening uh granite staters and
 
04:38:34.561 --> 04:38:35.269 align:start position:0%
are threatening uh granite staters and
and

04:38:35.269 --> 04:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:38:36.789 --> 04:38:36.799 align:start position:0%
our public leaders
 
04:38:39.590 --> 04:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
and then in terms of who this would
 
04:38:41.510 --> 04:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
effect or impact you know one of the
 
04:38:43.910 --> 04:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
things that's true about senate bill 154
 
04:38:46.390 --> 04:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
is that it does cast a really wide net
 
04:38:48.390 --> 04:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
it would prohibit state and local police
 
04:38:50.789 --> 04:38:50.799 align:start position:0%
but also judges prosecutors other state
 
04:38:50.799 --> 04:38:51.830 align:start position:0%
but also judges prosecutors other state
actors

04:38:51.830 --> 04:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
actors
 
04:38:53.830 --> 04:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
from enforcing administering or
 
04:38:57.429 --> 04:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
cooperating with any federal law act
 
04:38:59.590 --> 04:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
rule order regulation if the state of
 
04:39:01.109 --> 04:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire doesn't have
 
04:39:03.670 --> 04:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
those specific laws in place
 
04:39:04.709 --> 04:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
i can
 
04:39:06.390 --> 04:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
i think it would be really beneficial
 
04:39:08.551 --> 04:39:08.561 align:start position:0%
for this committee to ask um
 
04:39:10.709 --> 04:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
prosecutors members of law enforcement
 
04:39:12.949 --> 04:39:12.959 align:start position:0%
the judicial body how they think that
 
04:39:15.029 --> 04:39:15.039 align:start position:0%
this would impact them both in terms of
 
04:39:16.789 --> 04:39:16.799 align:start position:0%
the work that they already do
 
04:39:18.390 --> 04:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
the cooperation they have across state
 
04:39:20.709 --> 04:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
and federal agencies as well as any
 
04:39:22.150 --> 04:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
grants that they receive from the
 
04:39:24.070 --> 04:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
federal level to do the work to keep our
 
04:39:32.390 --> 04:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:34.709 --> 04:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
seeing no further hands raised i want to
 
04:39:36.470 --> 04:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank the
 
04:39:38.580 --> 04:39:38.590 align:start position:0%
one day to win this firefight
 
04:39:38.590 --> 04:39:41.670 align:start position:0%
one day to win this firefight

04:39:41.670 --> 04:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:43.270 --> 04:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair will recognize
 
04:39:49.110 --> 04:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:50.230 --> 04:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:39:52.150 --> 04:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
i'm tracy hon burkett and i'm here on
 
04:39:54.230 --> 04:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
behalf of myself and as the leader of
 
04:39:55.670 --> 04:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
the kent street coalition's working
 
04:39:57.990 --> 04:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
group on gun violence prevention
 
04:40:01.110 --> 04:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
i'm testifying against sb 154 because
 
04:40:02.948 --> 04:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
people are dying from gunshots in this
 
04:40:05.030 --> 04:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
country every single day
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's not just a few it's nearly 40 000
 
04:40:08.868 --> 04:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
people a year
 
04:40:10.948 --> 04:40:10.958 align:start position:0%
we see it on the news all the time we're
 
04:40:12.788 --> 04:40:12.798 align:start position:0%
no longer surprised to learn of mass
 
04:40:14.550 --> 04:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
shootings these reports are only
 
04:40:16.390 --> 04:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
slightly less regular than the sports
 
04:40:18.550 --> 04:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
and the weather reports children today
 
04:40:20.550 --> 04:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
do not regard being shot at school or
 
04:40:22.070 --> 04:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
elsewhere as something that probably
 
04:40:24.310 --> 04:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
won't happen to them now it's true that
 
04:40:25.910 --> 04:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire does better than most
 
04:40:28.470 --> 04:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
states but more than 150 people died
 
04:40:31.590 --> 04:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
here by gunshot in 2019 to say nothing
 
04:40:33.910 --> 04:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
of those who were shot and survived we
 
04:40:36.868 --> 04:40:36.878 align:start position:0%
can do better if only we choose to
 
04:40:38.868 --> 04:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
now given congress's inaction in this
 
04:40:40.788 --> 04:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
area the biden administration has chosen
 
04:40:43.270 --> 04:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
to do something via executive order a
 
04:40:44.948 --> 04:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
means of governing that was just fine
 
04:40:46.470 --> 04:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
with the current new hampshire majority
 
04:40:48.550 --> 04:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
party until as it says in the bill
 
04:40:51.750 --> 04:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
january 20th 2021
 
04:40:51.760 --> 04:40:52.708 align:start position:0%
january 20th 2021
um

04:40:52.708 --> 04:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:53.830 --> 04:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
the planned
 
04:40:53.840 --> 04:40:54.948 align:start position:0%
the planned
amendment

04:40:54.948 --> 04:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:40:57.670 --> 04:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
um would for example
 
04:40:57.680 --> 04:40:58.550 align:start position:0%
um would for example
the

04:40:58.550 --> 04:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:41:00.230 --> 04:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
i also want to speak against the
 
04:41:02.390 --> 04:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
amendment that we know is planned
 
04:41:04.230 --> 04:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
because it seeks to remove from the
 
04:41:06.070 --> 04:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire any and all
 
04:41:07.510 --> 04:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
protection that may be offered to them
 
04:41:09.590 --> 04:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
by the federal government which would
 
04:41:11.910 --> 04:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
mean for some people and in some cases a
 
04:41:14.070 --> 04:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
matter of life or death it seeks to
 
04:41:15.510 --> 04:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
divorce the people of new hampshire from
 
04:41:16.948 --> 04:41:16.958 align:start position:0%
the functions of the united states when
 
04:41:18.948 --> 04:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
it comes to matters of firearms knives
 
04:41:21.110 --> 04:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
and related items and just to provide an
 
04:41:23.190 --> 04:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
example if one of the frequent mass
 
04:41:25.590 --> 04:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
murders of 2021 were to occur in our
 
04:41:28.070 --> 04:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
state such that the fbi's assistance was
 
04:41:30.070 --> 04:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
warranted this amendment would make it
 
04:41:31.670 --> 04:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
illegal for any new hampshire law
 
04:41:33.510 --> 04:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement or other official to
 
04:41:35.510 --> 04:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
cooperate with them and new hampshire
 
04:41:37.190 --> 04:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
law enforcement would likely not be able
 
04:41:39.030 --> 04:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
to cooperate with federal agencies on
 
04:41:40.708 --> 04:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
investigations of extremist white
 
04:41:42.390 --> 04:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
nationalist groups or militias in the
 
04:41:44.310 --> 04:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
state particularly when they are led
 
04:41:46.948 --> 04:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
there via firearms based incidents and
 
04:41:47.990 --> 04:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
of course that could have a
 
04:41:50.070 --> 04:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
disproportionate negative impact on new
 
04:41:52.230 --> 04:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire people of color
 
04:41:54.628 --> 04:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
so just to sum up people want the
 
04:41:57.590 --> 04:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
overall bloodshed to stop and this bill
 
04:41:59.590 --> 04:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
is explicit in its intent to protect
 
04:42:02.070 --> 04:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
firearms but nowhere does it mention any
 
04:42:03.990 --> 04:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
desire to protect people
 
04:42:05.830 --> 04:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
and so i would just urge you to vote to
 
04:42:11.350 --> 04:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:14.948 --> 04:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:17.750 --> 04:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised
 
04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:27.750 --> 04:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
the chairman i recognize
 
04:42:32.788 --> 04:42:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:35.110 --> 04:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chair members of the
 
04:42:37.430 --> 04:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
committee alan rice again with gun
 
04:42:39.270 --> 04:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
owners of america
 
04:42:41.910 --> 04:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
um i did submit written testimony
 
04:42:44.708 --> 04:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
of our support for this bill
 
04:42:47.190 --> 04:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
when i drafted my written testimony i
 
04:42:49.350 --> 04:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
was under the mistaken impression that
 
04:42:51.110 --> 04:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment
 
04:42:53.990 --> 04:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
from the chair and representative bert
 
04:42:55.910 --> 04:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
i've been later informed that there's an
 
04:42:58.628 --> 04:42:58.638 align:start position:0%
amendment just from the chair
 
04:43:00.550 --> 04:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
i want to state that either amendment is
 
04:43:03.030 --> 04:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
acceptable to gun owners of america
 
04:43:05.990 --> 04:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're very much in favor of the concept
 
04:43:08.868 --> 04:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
of not using state and local resources
 
04:43:11.590 --> 04:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
to enforce federal laws
 
04:43:13.270 --> 04:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
the federal government they're going to
 
04:43:14.788 --> 04:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
do what they're going to do they can
 
04:43:17.830 --> 04:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
pass whatever laws they're going to pass
 
04:43:19.430 --> 04:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
and there's federal law enforcement
 
04:43:22.230 --> 04:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
agencies to enforce them
 
04:43:24.070 --> 04:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:43:26.070 --> 04:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
everyone knows new hampshire operates as
 
04:43:28.470 --> 04:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
a lean state with a lean budget
 
04:43:30.390 --> 04:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
we pride ourselves on you know new
 
04:43:33.030 --> 04:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
england frugality um and we clearly
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
should not be using a state and local
 
04:43:37.830 --> 04:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
resources to enforce federal gun laws
 
04:43:39.990 --> 04:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
um we do empathize with some of the
 
04:43:41.990 --> 04:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
previous speakers we're not in favor of
 
04:43:43.590 --> 04:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
the violence we're not in favor of the
 
04:43:46.708 --> 04:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
bloodshed we're not in favor of any of
 
04:43:48.150 --> 04:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
the things that are going on around the
 
04:43:50.390 --> 04:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
country at this time
 
04:43:51.830 --> 04:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
but we disagree
 
04:43:53.830 --> 04:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
we disagree because if there were to be
 
04:43:56.948 --> 04:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
such an incident in new hampshire
 
04:43:59.030 --> 04:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of state crimes that new
 
04:44:01.110 --> 04:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire law enforcement could charge a
 
04:44:02.868 --> 04:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
murderer with
 
04:44:05.270 --> 04:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing that would prevent
 
04:44:06.708 --> 04:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law enforcement from
 
04:44:09.750 --> 04:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
collaborating with fbi or atf
 
04:44:12.868 --> 04:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
in the case of true criminal activity
 
04:44:14.868 --> 04:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't prevent that what it
 
04:44:14.878 --> 04:44:16.788 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't prevent that what it
prevents

04:44:16.788 --> 04:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
prevents
 
04:44:19.190 --> 04:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
is the cooperation by state and local
 
04:44:20.628 --> 04:44:20.638 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and wholesale gun
 
04:44:22.390 --> 04:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
confiscation harassment of legitimate
 
04:44:24.470 --> 04:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
licensed gun dealers harassment of
 
04:44:26.788 --> 04:44:26.798 align:start position:0%
legitimate uh firearms owners who have
 
04:44:30.150 --> 04:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
done nothing wrong other than perhaps
 
04:44:32.390 --> 04:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
assemble the firearm at home
 
04:44:33.990 --> 04:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
which is something that's been done for
 
04:44:36.628 --> 04:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
over 200 years in our republic
 
04:44:38.948 --> 04:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
and rather than go on i'm going to refer
 
04:44:41.510 --> 04:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
to my written testimony and urged the
 
04:44:43.910 --> 04:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee to adopt either the
 
04:44:46.070 --> 04:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative abbas amendment or the
 
04:44:48.628 --> 04:44:48.638 align:start position:0%
representative abbas burt amendment and
 
04:44:51.390 --> 04:44:51.400 align:start position:0%

inclined

announced a an executive order uh that
 
04:45:39.680 --> 04:45:40.470 align:start position:0%
announced a an executive order uh that
would

04:45:40.470 --> 04:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:45:43.110 --> 04:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
that would ban ghost guns and i guess my
 
04:45:45.270 --> 04:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
question to you is is
 
04:45:47.750 --> 04:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
do you think ghost guns present
 
04:45:48.948 --> 04:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
04:45:51.270 --> 04:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of gun violence and
 
04:45:53.430 --> 04:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
is the proliferation of ghost guns
 
04:45:55.030 --> 04:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
something that your organization would
 
04:45:55.040 --> 04:45:57.110 align:start position:0%
something that your organization would
support

04:45:57.110 --> 04:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:45:57.120 --> 04:45:58.788 align:start position:0%
support
guns

04:45:58.788 --> 04:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
guns
 
04:46:01.910 --> 04:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
guns are not violent
 
04:46:04.230 --> 04:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
guns are inanimate objects
 
04:46:06.868 --> 04:46:06.878 align:start position:0%
no more responsible for violence
 
04:46:08.708 --> 04:46:08.718 align:start position:0%
than the automobile that was driven by
 
04:46:10.708 --> 04:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
the murderer in charlottesville virginia
 
04:46:12.628 --> 04:46:12.638 align:start position:0%

04:46:12.638 --> 04:46:13.750 align:start position:0%
and we don't refer to it as automobile
violence

04:46:13.750 --> 04:46:13.760 align:start position:0%

04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
there is no such thing as a ghost gun
 
04:46:17.590 --> 04:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
guns are not invisible
 
04:46:19.110 --> 04:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
what i believe you're referring to
 
04:46:21.750 --> 04:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative is firearms that are home
 
04:46:23.590 --> 04:46:23.600 align:start position:0%

04:46:31.910 --> 04:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
support the activity we do not agree
 
04:46:34.150 --> 04:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
with banning the home assembly of
 
04:46:36.230 --> 04:46:36.240 align:start position:0%

04:46:40.550 --> 04:46:40.560 align:start position:0%

04:51:52.310 --> 04:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
do you think we should pass any laws
 
04:51:54.948 --> 04:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
that around who could access firearms
 
04:51:58.230 --> 04:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
what type of firearms or both
 
04:52:00.708 --> 04:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
no i think we should repeal the laws
 
04:52:02.310 --> 04:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
that prevent people from easily
 
04:52:09.190 --> 04:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:11.350 --> 04:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i it said i was muted can you
 
04:52:12.788 --> 04:52:12.798 align:start position:0%
hear me now
 
04:52:17.270 --> 04:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
we can i'm i'm sorry um i said i think
 
04:52:19.510 --> 04:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
we should do the contrary we should uh
 
04:52:22.070 --> 04:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
repeal the laws that make it difficult
 
04:52:23.670 --> 04:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
inconvenient and expensive for
 
04:52:25.190 --> 04:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
law-abiding people to access
 
04:52:27.030 --> 04:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
self-defense firearms i think people
 
04:52:28.550 --> 04:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
have an absolute right to defend
 
04:52:28.560 --> 04:52:29.670 align:start position:0%
have an absolute right to defend
themselves

04:52:29.670 --> 04:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
04:52:31.430 --> 04:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
and if you look at new hampshire and
 
04:52:31.440 --> 04:52:32.708 align:start position:0%
and if you look at new hampshire and
maine

04:52:32.708 --> 04:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
maine
 
04:52:34.310 --> 04:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
with our
 
04:52:34.320 --> 04:52:35.430 align:start position:0%
with our
very

04:52:35.430 --> 04:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:52:37.190 --> 04:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
gun laws that allow people to actually
 
04:52:38.948 --> 04:52:38.958 align:start position:0%
defend themselves in comparison to
 
04:52:41.430 --> 04:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
places like new york and chicago where
 
04:52:43.110 --> 04:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
that right is encumbered i think you'll
 
04:52:44.628 --> 04:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
find that it's much safer up here
 
04:52:44.638 --> 04:52:53.510 align:start position:0%
find that it's much safer up here
representative

04:52:53.510 --> 04:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:55.110 --> 04:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative bradley you are
 
04:52:57.670 --> 04:52:57.680 align:start position:0%

04:52:59.350 --> 04:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
04:53:02.788 --> 04:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
um so mr rice so you're seeing that
 
04:53:06.310 --> 04:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
you're happy with anybody owning a gun
 
04:53:08.070 --> 04:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
anyone and everybody to protect
 
04:53:08.080 --> 04:53:09.510 align:start position:0%
anyone and everybody to protect
themselves

04:53:09.510 --> 04:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
04:53:11.270 --> 04:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think i said that representative
 
04:53:13.430 --> 04:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
i said i am happy and comfortable with
 
04:53:16.150 --> 04:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
law-abiding citizens owning firearms for
 
04:53:17.990 --> 04:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
legitimate self-defense or any other
 
04:53:20.310 --> 04:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
reason that they see fit as guaranteed
 
04:53:22.628 --> 04:53:22.638 align:start position:0%
by the second amendment
 
04:53:24.310 --> 04:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
president you're recognized for a
 
04:53:26.070 --> 04:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
04:53:28.070 --> 04:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so mr ice how would we ensure
 
04:53:30.310 --> 04:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
their law abiding citizens
 
04:53:32.788 --> 04:53:32.798 align:start position:0%
once they break the law we have police
 
04:53:36.230 --> 04:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
who are very capable of investigating
 
04:53:38.230 --> 04:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
arresting and prosecuting those law
 
04:53:40.310 --> 04:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
breakers but until they break the law
 
04:53:42.310 --> 04:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
they have the same constitutional rights
 
04:53:43.750 --> 04:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
as everybody else and we should not
 
04:54:00.868 --> 04:54:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:03.910 --> 04:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:06.788 --> 04:54:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:09.110 --> 04:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
are there any members of the public
 
04:54:10.628 --> 04:54:10.638 align:start position:0%
who wish to testify that are in
 
04:54:12.708 --> 04:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
attendance that have not testified
 
04:54:15.030 --> 04:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
testified already
 
04:54:22.070 --> 04:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:29.990 --> 04:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:31.910 --> 04:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
just a reminder testimony is limited to
 
04:54:34.390 --> 04:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
one minute
 
04:54:36.070 --> 04:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman
 
04:54:38.550 --> 04:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
for the record j.r hole dunbarton new
 
04:54:41.190 --> 04:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire um also of the new hampshire
 
04:54:42.628 --> 04:54:42.638 align:start position:0%
board of sorry new hampshire firearms
 
04:54:44.708 --> 04:54:44.718 align:start position:0%
coalition board of directors we are in
 
04:54:47.430 --> 04:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
support of sb 154 but we would ask for
 
04:54:48.788 --> 04:54:48.798 align:start position:0%
an amendment and we would ask for an
 
04:54:51.190 --> 04:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
amendment that goes further than just
 
04:54:53.510 --> 04:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
executive orders executive orders are
 
04:54:55.270 --> 04:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
only the tip of the iceberg
 
04:54:57.430 --> 04:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
and what happened when biden wrote the
 
04:55:00.150 --> 04:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
executive orders he directed the atf to
 
04:55:02.070 --> 04:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
start implementing rules
 
04:55:04.868 --> 04:55:04.878 align:start position:0%
and the bigger issue at hand is much
 
04:55:07.030 --> 04:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
broader than just the particular
 
04:55:09.670 --> 04:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
emergency orders or executive orders by
 
04:55:11.270 --> 04:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
the president
 
04:55:12.788 --> 04:55:12.798 align:start position:0%
we would ask that you would adopt an
 
04:55:15.190 --> 04:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
amendment that addresses both or
 
04:55:17.750 --> 04:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
addresses all of the following
 
04:55:19.750 --> 04:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
congressional actions
 
04:55:22.868 --> 04:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
executive orders and atf rules and that
 
04:55:25.590 --> 04:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
there be penalties for
 
04:55:28.550 --> 04:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
local and state officials who choose to
 
04:55:30.310 --> 04:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
follow federal law
 
04:55:33.270 --> 04:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
over state law when it comes or federal
 
04:55:36.550 --> 04:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
rules over over state law when it comes
 
04:55:38.470 --> 04:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
to enforcement of these policies
 
04:55:39.990 --> 04:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
as one of the former members who
 
04:55:42.390 --> 04:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
testified said the federal government
 
04:55:44.470 --> 04:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
has employees that can can enforce these
 
04:55:44.480 --> 04:55:45.430 align:start position:0%
has employees that can can enforce these
laws

04:55:45.430 --> 04:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
laws
 
04:55:46.788 --> 04:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
but we shouldn't be using our state
 
04:55:48.310 --> 04:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
resources that way
 
04:55:50.470 --> 04:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
so i will ask that you adopt a stronger
 
04:55:51.830 --> 04:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
amendment than what was passed out of
 
04:55:59.910 --> 04:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:05.510 --> 04:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:06.948 --> 04:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised the witnesses
 
04:56:06.958 --> 04:56:12.788 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised the witnesses
excused

04:56:12.788 --> 04:56:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:14.390 --> 04:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
is any members of the type of wish to
 
04:56:17.110 --> 04:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
testify that have not testified already
 
04:56:33.670 --> 04:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:37.910 --> 04:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:39.510 --> 04:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
we'll be in recess for
 
05:06:23.830 --> 05:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:35.350 --> 05:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:38.390 --> 05:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
laura i don't think anybody is answering
 
05:06:38.400 --> 05:06:39.510 align:start position:0%

05:06:50.400 --> 05:06:51.510 align:start position:0%

i don't know why
 
05:16:06.230 --> 05:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
okay i just thought it was inappropriate
 
05:16:07.750 --> 05:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
for us to be uh
 
05:16:10.628 --> 05:16:10.638 align:start position:0%

05:16:28.550 --> 05:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
prefer to address the business
 
05:16:30.150 --> 05:16:30.160 align:start position:0%

05:16:54.470 --> 05:16:54.480 align:start position:0%

blocking camera
 
05:16:58.150 --> 05:16:58.160 align:start position:0%

well that's that's the decision
 
05:17:03.110 --> 05:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
well they're all blocked
 
05:17:05.110 --> 05:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
that's all right
 
05:17:18.150 --> 05:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:19.830 --> 05:17:19.840 align:start position:0%

05:18:27.270 --> 05:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:18:30.390 --> 05:18:30.400 align:start position:0%

sec now emotions the amendment's being
 
05:18:33.360 --> 05:18:37.510 align:start position:0%
sec now emotions the amendment's being
offered

05:18:37.510 --> 05:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:39.430 --> 05:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
from the bus do you wish to discuss the
 
05:18:39.440 --> 05:18:41.830 align:start position:0%
from the bus do you wish to discuss the
amendment

05:18:41.830 --> 05:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:18:44.948 --> 05:18:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:49.030 --> 05:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
however this has the severability for it
 
05:18:50.948 --> 05:18:50.958 align:start position:0%
which is an important part of it because
 
05:18:53.350 --> 05:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
if any part of the
 
05:18:54.708 --> 05:18:54.718 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
05:18:54.718 --> 05:18:55.990 align:start position:0%
this uh
legislation

05:18:55.990 --> 05:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:19:08.868 --> 05:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:18.868 --> 05:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:20.868 --> 05:19:20.878 align:start position:0%
it's time to chair now open the question
 
05:19:36.868 --> 05:19:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:39.190 --> 05:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair uh i'm going to
 
05:19:41.350 --> 05:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
oppose the amendment and uh and oppose
 
05:19:42.390 --> 05:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:19:44.150 --> 05:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think that the amendment
 
05:19:46.948 --> 05:19:46.958 align:start position:0%
helps to bill uh one iota
 
05:19:46.958 --> 05:19:48.070 align:start position:0%
helps to bill uh one iota
um

05:19:48.070 --> 05:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:49.270 --> 05:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
this is uh
 
05:19:51.990 --> 05:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh what's very very likely uh
 
05:19:56.070 --> 05:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
an unconstitutional uh abrogation of
 
05:19:58.788 --> 05:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
federal government that we also elect uh
 
05:20:00.390 --> 05:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
we just don't elect a government here in
 
05:20:01.750 --> 05:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we elect a federal
 
05:20:03.270 --> 05:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
government as well
 
05:20:05.750 --> 05:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm also looking at uh some of
 
05:20:06.948 --> 05:20:06.958 align:start position:0%
the orders
 
05:20:08.470 --> 05:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
05:20:09.830 --> 05:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
you know that the uh that the
 
05:20:12.390 --> 05:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
administration is actually uh looking at
 
05:20:15.750 --> 05:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
getting passed uh and and frankly
 
05:20:18.550 --> 05:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh ghost guns are an increasing problem
 
05:20:21.110 --> 05:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh the fact that they're untraceable
 
05:20:23.670 --> 05:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
um uh really puts law enforcement over
 
05:20:25.590 --> 05:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
the barrel when it comes to
 
05:20:27.830 --> 05:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
trying to associate uh these guns with
 
05:20:30.390 --> 05:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
people who who've committed crimes
 
05:20:32.868 --> 05:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
um these are guns that also empower
 
05:20:34.948 --> 05:20:34.958 align:start position:0%
people that we don't necessarily want
 
05:20:37.030 --> 05:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
empowered as a society
 
05:20:39.030 --> 05:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
like militias and white supremacist
 
05:20:41.990 --> 05:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
groups um who may not want to who
 
05:20:44.390 --> 05:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh who may have some members who uh may
 
05:20:47.030 --> 05:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
not actually be able to walk into a gun
 
05:20:49.510 --> 05:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
store uh and to buy their weapons
 
05:20:53.830 --> 05:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
legally so uh the issue is i i think
 
05:20:53.840 --> 05:20:54.708 align:start position:0%
legally so uh the issue is i i think
that

05:20:54.708 --> 05:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:20:56.150 --> 05:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
05:20:59.030 --> 05:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to buy a gun legally
 
05:20:59.040 --> 05:20:59.830 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to buy a gun legally
uh

05:20:59.830 --> 05:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:21:01.190 --> 05:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
can buy a gun
 
05:21:02.948 --> 05:21:02.958 align:start position:0%
it it's not an issue
 
05:21:04.708 --> 05:21:04.718 align:start position:0%
uh and i think
 
05:21:06.788 --> 05:21:06.798 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do is it would
 
05:21:09.990 --> 05:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
dramatically weaken the ability
 
05:21:11.830 --> 05:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
of us to
 
05:21:11.840 --> 05:21:13.750 align:start position:0%
of us to
uh

05:21:13.750 --> 05:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:21:16.070 --> 05:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
keep guns out of the hands you know of
 
05:21:18.788 --> 05:21:18.798 align:start position:0%
people who simply uh shouldn't have them
 
05:21:21.270 --> 05:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
and who could endanger public safety
 
05:21:23.270 --> 05:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
and i do think that part of our role as
 
05:21:23.280 --> 05:21:25.190 align:start position:0%
and i do think that part of our role as
legislators

05:21:25.190 --> 05:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
05:21:27.430 --> 05:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
isn't just always taking an absolute
 
05:21:29.990 --> 05:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
absolutist viewpoint of whatever
 
05:21:32.948 --> 05:21:32.958 align:start position:0%
happens to be uh happens to be in the
 
05:21:34.708 --> 05:21:34.718 align:start position:0%
bill of rights i think we also need to
 
05:21:36.708 --> 05:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
take a look at the fact that we have a
 
05:21:38.470 --> 05:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
very real obligation
 
05:21:40.788 --> 05:21:40.798 align:start position:0%
uh to protect public safety and and i
 
05:21:42.788 --> 05:21:42.798 align:start position:0%
think that with the executive order on
 
05:21:44.628 --> 05:21:44.638 align:start position:0%
ghost guns that's something that the
 
05:21:47.430 --> 05:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
biden administration has taken response
 
05:21:49.910 --> 05:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
has essentially um
 
05:21:49.920 --> 05:21:50.708 align:start position:0%
has essentially um
uh

05:21:50.708 --> 05:21:50.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:21:53.910 --> 05:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
taken responsibility to uh you know to
 
05:21:55.590 --> 05:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure we have that sort of
 
05:21:55.600 --> 05:21:56.868 align:start position:0%
to make sure we have that sort of
protection

05:21:56.868 --> 05:21:56.878 align:start position:0%
protection
 
05:21:56.878 --> 05:21:57.750 align:start position:0%
protection
so

05:21:57.750 --> 05:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:21:57.760 --> 05:21:58.708 align:start position:0%
so
the

05:21:58.708 --> 05:21:58.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:22:02.628 --> 05:22:02.638 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is i i i don't think uh
 
05:22:05.270 --> 05:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
that passing this bill uh would be a
 
05:22:07.750 --> 05:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
tremendously wise thing and i also think
 
05:22:10.470 --> 05:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
it would be uh an absolutely terrible
 
05:22:13.270 --> 05:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
precedent uh for us to set
 
05:22:15.670 --> 05:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh what's next
 
05:22:18.310 --> 05:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
guns what's next income taxes uh we
 
05:22:20.310 --> 05:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
don't have income taxes in new hampshire
 
05:22:22.150 --> 05:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
you know how dare the federal government
 
05:22:24.708 --> 05:22:24.718 align:start position:0%
uh you know uh try to impose in income
 
05:22:27.030 --> 05:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
taxes on people who've never voted for a
 
05:22:29.590 --> 05:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
state income tax you know where does it
 
05:22:29.600 --> 05:22:30.868 align:start position:0%
state income tax you know where does it
stop

05:22:30.868 --> 05:22:30.878 align:start position:0%
stop
 
05:22:33.030 --> 05:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
um and i think where it needs to stop is
 
05:22:39.590 --> 05:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:40.788 --> 05:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:22:42.470 --> 05:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
represent me if i may just require
 
05:22:44.550 --> 05:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
progression what about
 
05:22:44.560 --> 05:22:45.510 align:start position:0%
progression what about
this

05:22:45.510 --> 05:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:22:46.868 --> 05:22:46.878 align:start position:0%
amendment do you find to be
 
05:22:46.878 --> 05:22:51.910 align:start position:0%
amendment do you find to be
unconstitutional

05:22:51.910 --> 05:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:54.310 --> 05:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
but you still do you still muted mr
 
05:22:56.550 --> 05:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
chairman i would actually like to hear
 
05:22:59.670 --> 05:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
from people who are actually uh
 
05:23:01.670 --> 05:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
some experts in constitutional law as
 
05:23:03.270 --> 05:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
opposed to people who are experts on
 
05:23:06.070 --> 05:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
selling guns uh when it comes to uh to
 
05:23:07.590 --> 05:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
bills like this
 
05:23:07.600 --> 05:23:08.788 align:start position:0%
bills like this
um

05:23:08.788 --> 05:23:08.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:11.110 --> 05:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
i do think that uh
 
05:23:13.110 --> 05:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
05:23:14.470 --> 05:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
05:23:14.480 --> 05:23:15.910 align:start position:0%
that there are
uh

05:23:15.910 --> 05:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:23:15.920 --> 05:23:16.708 align:start position:0%
uh
uh

05:23:16.708 --> 05:23:16.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:23:17.910 --> 05:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
05:23:19.910 --> 05:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
i think that to the the the tenth
 
05:23:23.750 --> 05:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
amendment uh i believe uh is uh uh is
 
05:23:25.590 --> 05:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment that uh that
 
05:23:25.600 --> 05:23:26.788 align:start position:0%
the amendment that uh that
essentially

05:23:26.788 --> 05:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
05:23:26.798 --> 05:23:27.670 align:start position:0%
essentially
um

05:23:27.670 --> 05:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:31.190 --> 05:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh prohibits states or or that that puts
 
05:23:34.310 --> 05:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
guidelines around uh uh what states can
 
05:23:37.030 --> 05:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
do uh in terms of uh
 
05:23:38.830 --> 05:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
of dealing with the the
 
05:23:41.430 --> 05:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
power forcing federal laws
 
05:23:41.440 --> 05:23:42.310 align:start position:0%
power forcing federal laws
um

05:23:42.310 --> 05:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:45.430 --> 05:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
and i uh you know i i just think again
 
05:23:48.550 --> 05:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
that this is uh it's a it's a it's a bad
 
05:23:51.350 --> 05:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
precedent uh and it puts us in a
 
05:23:54.628 --> 05:23:54.638 align:start position:0%
in a in a tough position as a state and
 
05:23:56.310 --> 05:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
and bottom line is when it comes to
 
05:23:58.708 --> 05:23:58.718 align:start position:0%
something like ghost guns uh if these
 
05:24:00.868 --> 05:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
actually do become a problem in new
 
05:24:02.628 --> 05:24:02.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire how do we
 
05:24:04.230 --> 05:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
what do we do
 
05:24:05.990 --> 05:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
05:24:08.868 --> 05:24:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:12.070 --> 05:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's an un it's an unnecessary bill
 
05:24:15.590 --> 05:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh at a bad time uh and i don't think we
 
05:24:15.600 --> 05:24:19.948 align:start position:0%
uh at a bad time uh and i don't think we
need

05:24:19.948 --> 05:24:19.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:22.948 --> 05:24:22.958 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
05:24:24.948 --> 05:24:24.958 align:start position:0%
representative defender office you were
 
05:24:29.110 --> 05:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:32.550 --> 05:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
i i just imperious to the fact
 
05:24:35.510 --> 05:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
of we must interfere with any
 
05:24:44.390 --> 05:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:47.670 --> 05:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
can anybody answer that
 
05:24:48.948 --> 05:24:48.958 align:start position:0%
he would pretend
 
05:24:51.910 --> 05:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
it would it would matter on the
 
05:24:54.390 --> 05:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
specific type of brand that you would be
 
05:24:58.390 --> 05:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:00.948 --> 05:25:00.958 align:start position:0%
what second question
 
05:25:03.110 --> 05:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
would it interfere anyway
 
05:25:05.590 --> 05:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
with this money that's coming in
 
05:25:05.600 --> 05:25:06.948 align:start position:0%
with this money that's coming in
from

05:25:06.948 --> 05:25:06.958 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:25:09.670 --> 05:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
the culvert
 
05:25:11.910 --> 05:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not aware of having any
 
05:25:14.070 --> 05:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
success restrictions
 
05:25:23.190 --> 05:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:25.110 --> 05:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned
 
05:25:28.390 --> 05:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
article 10 he alluded to it as if if the
 
05:25:30.868 --> 05:25:30.878 align:start position:0%
federal government had the right
 
05:25:32.310 --> 05:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
to tell the
 
05:25:33.990 --> 05:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
states what to do
 
05:25:35.670 --> 05:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
let me immediately it's fairly short it
 
05:25:37.270 --> 05:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
says the power is not delegated in the
 
05:25:40.070 --> 05:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
united states by the constitution
 
05:25:42.708 --> 05:25:42.718 align:start position:0%
or prohibited by the states
 
05:25:45.750 --> 05:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
are reserved to the states respectively
 
05:25:47.510 --> 05:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
or to their people
 
05:25:49.430 --> 05:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
this is sort of limiting to the federal
 
05:25:51.750 --> 05:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
government we tend to believe that
 
05:25:55.270 --> 05:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
if they give us money or if uh you know
 
05:25:57.750 --> 05:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
they smile right
 
05:25:59.510 --> 05:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
that they have a right
 
05:26:00.868 --> 05:26:00.878 align:start position:0%
to governors
 
05:26:03.430 --> 05:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
and they have a right to govern us up to
 
05:26:05.190 --> 05:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
a point so
 
05:26:06.788 --> 05:26:06.798 align:start position:0%
you got to read the right part of the
 
05:26:09.030 --> 05:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
constitution and the real constitution
 
05:26:27.350 --> 05:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:28.948 --> 05:26:28.958 align:start position:0%
this time the chair recognizes uh
 
05:26:31.910 --> 05:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative welch uh it's kind of a
 
05:26:35.110 --> 05:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:37.030 --> 05:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
executive artist
 
05:26:39.590 --> 05:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
what is that in the consciousness
 
05:26:41.430 --> 05:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
it's the executive branch
 
05:26:43.350 --> 05:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
making laws
 
05:26:44.948 --> 05:26:44.958 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's anything wrong
 
05:26:44.958 --> 05:26:46.150 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's anything wrong
with

05:26:46.150 --> 05:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:26:52.628 --> 05:26:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:54.550 --> 05:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
05:26:54.560 --> 05:26:56.070 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
oshawa

05:26:56.070 --> 05:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
oshawa
 
05:27:02.550 --> 05:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:04.390 --> 05:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:27:09.270 --> 05:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:11.350 --> 05:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:27:14.868 --> 05:27:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:14.878 --> 05:27:16.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:27:16.070 --> 05:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:18.628 --> 05:27:18.638 align:start position:0%
i do want to point out that
 
05:27:21.670 --> 05:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
first of all the federal government
 
05:27:23.670 --> 05:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely has the right to place
 
05:27:27.750 --> 05:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
conditions on any federal funds um so
 
05:27:30.708 --> 05:27:30.718 align:start position:0%
there is a distinct possibility that
 
05:27:33.270 --> 05:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
were this kind this amendment or even
 
05:27:35.510 --> 05:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
the original bill to pass
 
05:27:38.708 --> 05:27:38.718 align:start position:0%
um yeah we could be looking at
 
05:27:38.718 --> 05:27:40.150 align:start position:0%
um yeah we could be looking at
um

05:27:40.150 --> 05:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:43.190 --> 05:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
at a you know uh
 
05:27:46.628 --> 05:27:46.638 align:start position:0%
a quid pro quo on getting federal funds
 
05:27:48.868 --> 05:27:48.878 align:start position:0%
particularly if we're not going to abide
 
05:27:48.878 --> 05:27:49.750 align:start position:0%
particularly if we're not going to abide
by

05:27:49.750 --> 05:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:27:53.990 --> 05:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
um executive orders um
 
05:27:56.310 --> 05:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
and i want to remind the committee that
 
05:27:57.590 --> 05:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
several states
 
05:28:00.390 --> 05:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
um passed tried to pass nullification
 
05:28:03.910 --> 05:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
laws like this under president obama and
 
05:28:06.868 --> 05:28:06.878 align:start position:0%
those were ruled unconstitutional this
 
05:28:06.878 --> 05:28:08.070 align:start position:0%
those were ruled unconstitutional this
amendment

05:28:08.070 --> 05:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:28:12.230 --> 05:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
and the underlying bill um will not
 
05:28:15.190 --> 05:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
pass muster they are they will not pass
 
05:28:16.788 --> 05:28:16.798 align:start position:0%
a constitutional
 
05:28:16.798 --> 05:28:17.910 align:start position:0%
a constitutional
um

05:28:17.910 --> 05:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:17.920 --> 05:28:19.030 align:start position:0%
um
challenge

05:28:19.030 --> 05:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
05:28:21.190 --> 05:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:28:23.030 --> 05:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a
 
05:28:25.110 --> 05:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's a lawsuit just
 
05:28:27.830 --> 05:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
in the waiting i don't know why we would
 
05:28:30.070 --> 05:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
specifically want to do that
 
05:28:32.788 --> 05:28:32.798 align:start position:0%
um and and also
 
05:28:35.430 --> 05:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
we have we know
 
05:28:37.030 --> 05:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
we are aware
 
05:28:39.030 --> 05:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
that there are groups that call
 
05:28:41.190 --> 05:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
themselves militia
 
05:28:43.350 --> 05:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
and have shown up
 
05:28:45.430 --> 05:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
in various places
 
05:28:49.030 --> 05:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
around our around the state at different
 
05:28:52.230 --> 05:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
um spaces i've seen them at you know at
 
05:28:52.240 --> 05:28:53.030 align:start position:0%
um spaces i've seen them at you know at
the

05:28:53.030 --> 05:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:28:54.788 --> 05:28:54.798 align:start position:0%
at the aapi
 
05:28:56.868 --> 05:28:56.878 align:start position:0%
support rally that i was at with
 
05:28:59.670 --> 05:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
representative manjuputi
 
05:29:01.430 --> 05:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:29:03.670 --> 05:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
should they decide to take
 
05:29:05.350 --> 05:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
violent action
 
05:29:08.628 --> 05:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
yeah the fbi would want to come here to
 
05:29:10.868 --> 05:29:10.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and this amendment and the
 
05:29:12.628 --> 05:29:12.638 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
 
05:29:12.638 --> 05:29:13.750 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
would

05:29:13.750 --> 05:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:29:17.110 --> 05:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
exclude and preclude
 
05:29:19.510 --> 05:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh local law enforcement and the state
 
05:29:19.520 --> 05:29:20.548 align:start position:0%
uh local law enforcement and the state
police

05:29:20.548 --> 05:29:20.558 align:start position:0%
police
 
05:29:23.430 --> 05:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
from cooperating and there would be two
 
05:29:25.670 --> 05:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
different investigations going on if
 
05:29:27.750 --> 05:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
there were there would be this would
 
05:29:28.788 --> 05:29:28.798 align:start position:0%
this would
 
05:29:31.430 --> 05:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
cut us out of cooperation
 
05:29:33.590 --> 05:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
so um i don't think that's a very good
 
05:29:33.600 --> 05:29:34.548 align:start position:0%
so um i don't think that's a very good
idea

05:29:34.548 --> 05:29:34.558 align:start position:0%
idea
 
05:29:35.510 --> 05:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
at all
 
05:29:37.670 --> 05:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
to cut us out of cooperating with our
 
05:29:47.270 --> 05:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:49.110 --> 05:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
05:29:52.470 --> 05:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that a case was
 
05:29:54.310 --> 05:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
a rule bank
 
05:29:57.110 --> 05:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
it feels similar to senate bill 154 has
 
05:29:58.310 --> 05:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional do you have the case
 
05:30:03.190 --> 05:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:09.990 --> 05:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:12.868 --> 05:30:12.878 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry was that a question for me i
 
05:30:14.628 --> 05:30:14.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it was
 
05:30:17.430 --> 05:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
a similar laws of
 
05:30:19.830 --> 05:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
which senator 154
 
05:30:22.628 --> 05:30:22.638 align:start position:0%
have been ruled unconstitutional
 
05:30:24.150 --> 05:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
i'm asking if you have the title of the
 
05:30:26.230 --> 05:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
case that builds
 
05:30:27.750 --> 05:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
a lot similar to
 
05:30:32.310 --> 05:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:34.070 --> 05:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
you i don't need the full-size
 
05:30:37.750 --> 05:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:40.310 --> 05:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
so um there was a nullification case
 
05:30:43.190 --> 05:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
brought against um
 
05:30:43.200 --> 05:30:44.868 align:start position:0%
brought against um
the

05:30:44.868 --> 05:30:44.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:30:48.708 --> 05:30:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:50.310 --> 05:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
and there
 
05:30:52.628 --> 05:30:52.638 align:start position:0%
and i if you want i will put together a
 
05:30:56.390 --> 05:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
list for you but there was arkansas
 
05:30:59.750 --> 05:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
tried to do a nullification case um for
 
05:31:01.830 --> 05:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
nullifying gun restrictions
 
05:31:05.190 --> 05:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
so i mean i can i can put together more

thank you
 
05:31:14.788 --> 05:31:14.798 align:start position:0%
representative where may you're
 
05:31:14.798 --> 05:31:16.548 align:start position:0%
representative where may you're
recognized

05:31:16.548 --> 05:31:16.558 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
05:31:18.230 --> 05:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
05:31:18.240 --> 05:31:19.030 align:start position:0%
mr chair
um

05:31:19.030 --> 05:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:21.670 --> 05:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
i've heard arguments before
 
05:31:25.510 --> 05:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:26.868 --> 05:31:26.878 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
05:31:29.190 --> 05:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
a uh a problem
 
05:31:31.430 --> 05:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
i i don't see how it just feels solving
 
05:31:33.990 --> 05:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
any problem that uh exists
 
05:31:35.990 --> 05:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh there's a possibility of a problem in
 
05:31:38.230 --> 05:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
the future but there certainly isn't a
 
05:31:40.150 --> 05:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
problem at the moment
 
05:31:41.830 --> 05:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh and i wanna
 
05:31:44.070 --> 05:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
add one more thing and that is
 
05:31:44.080 --> 05:31:45.910 align:start position:0%
add one more thing and that is
uh

05:31:45.910 --> 05:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:31:47.990 --> 05:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
and this may be questionable
 
05:31:48.000 --> 05:31:48.830 align:start position:0%
and this may be questionable
that

05:31:48.830 --> 05:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:31:48.840 --> 05:31:50.708 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:31:50.708 --> 05:31:50.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:52.390 --> 05:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
05:31:52.400 --> 05:31:53.510 align:start position:0%
federal law
is

05:31:53.510 --> 05:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:31:56.070 --> 05:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
our local and state government law
 
05:31:56.080 --> 05:31:57.270 align:start position:0%
our local and state government law
enforcement

05:31:57.270 --> 05:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
05:32:00.150 --> 05:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
are not authorized to
 
05:32:02.070 --> 05:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
enforce federal law
 
05:32:04.390 --> 05:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
only federal agents are
 
05:32:04.400 --> 05:32:05.670 align:start position:0%
only federal agents are
so

05:32:05.670 --> 05:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:32:08.788 --> 05:32:08.798 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why we need this bill
 
05:32:10.868 --> 05:32:10.878 align:start position:0%
or the amendment to the bill
 
05:32:10.878 --> 05:32:11.910 align:start position:0%
or the amendment to the bill
so

05:32:11.910 --> 05:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:32:41.900 --> 05:32:41.910 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:41.910 --> 05:32:58.230 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:32:58.230 --> 05:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:00.310 --> 05:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
if the federal law and the state law are
 
05:33:04.310 --> 05:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
consistent it's not precluding the
 
05:33:06.150 --> 05:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
state government from working together
 
05:33:08.230 --> 05:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
right so
 
05:33:10.470 --> 05:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
this requires there to be any federal
 
05:33:12.470 --> 05:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
law that will be passed
 
05:33:18.708 --> 05:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:18.718 --> 05:33:19.590 align:start position:0%
 
if

05:33:19.590 --> 05:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:33:22.628 --> 05:33:22.638 align:start position:0%
uh congress would have passed a bill to
 
05:33:24.948 --> 05:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
confiscate all the firearms of everybody
 
05:33:27.110 --> 05:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
who owns them that would be quite
 
05:33:27.120 --> 05:33:28.390 align:start position:0%
who owns them that would be quite
inconsistent

05:33:28.390 --> 05:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
inconsistent
 
05:33:30.868 --> 05:33:30.878 align:start position:0%
i can't imagine anybody going along with
 
05:33:30.878 --> 05:33:32.310 align:start position:0%
i can't imagine anybody going along with
that

05:33:32.310 --> 05:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:33:34.548 --> 05:33:34.558 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't it people it's also
 
05:33:34.558 --> 05:33:35.750 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't it people it's also
clarified

05:33:35.750 --> 05:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
clarified
 
05:33:37.350 --> 05:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
if you violate federal law that it's
 
05:33:39.030 --> 05:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
still a crime you're just violating
 
05:33:40.708 --> 05:33:40.718 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
05:33:43.190 --> 05:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
and there is i mean i can recall
 
05:33:45.270 --> 05:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
precedence in his own committee passage
 
05:33:46.948 --> 05:33:46.958 align:start position:0%
was doing that the
 
05:33:49.990 --> 05:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
last term was hb 481
 
05:33:52.150 --> 05:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
both of the recreational marijuana a
 
05:33:54.788 --> 05:33:54.798 align:start position:0%
recreational candidate and in that bill
 
05:33:56.788 --> 05:33:56.798 align:start position:0%
it expressly stated that local law
 
05:33:56.798 --> 05:33:58.070 align:start position:0%
it expressly stated that local law
enforcement

05:33:58.070 --> 05:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
05:33:59.910 --> 05:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
officials will not cooperate with
 
05:34:02.150 --> 05:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
federal officers and enforcing
 
05:34:02.160 --> 05:34:03.830 align:start position:0%
federal officers and enforcing
uh

05:34:03.830 --> 05:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:34:03.840 --> 05:34:04.708 align:start position:0%
uh
federal

05:34:04.708 --> 05:34:04.718 align:start position:0%
federal
 
05:34:06.150 --> 05:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis laws so
 
05:34:07.910 --> 05:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
we have that they may pass in this
 
05:34:09.110 --> 05:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
committee of passing the house class
 
05:34:11.350 --> 05:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
term it didn't become wrong
 
05:34:14.390 --> 05:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
so it has been done and all is the same
 
05:34:16.070 --> 05:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
is that the state
 
05:34:17.590 --> 05:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
is not going to enforce laws that are
 
05:34:19.430 --> 05:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
inconsistent the federal laws are
 
05:34:21.510 --> 05:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
executive orders that are inconsistent
 
05:34:23.750 --> 05:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
with the statements
 
05:34:25.670 --> 05:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
and if there is a new law that were to
 
05:34:28.868 --> 05:34:28.878 align:start position:0%
come out i would believe it would be
 
05:34:30.150 --> 05:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
something the state should consider
 
05:34:34.390 --> 05:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:37.670 --> 05:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's for saying the circumstances
 
05:34:39.830 --> 05:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
congress would take large capacity
 
05:34:42.628 --> 05:34:42.638 align:start position:0%
magazines and put a ban on them
 
05:34:44.628 --> 05:34:44.638 align:start position:0%
everybody who's got those
 
05:34:48.470 --> 05:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
the value of those goes up 10 times
 
05:34:52.390 --> 05:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
well i didn't realize that before
 
05:34:52.400 --> 05:34:53.190 align:start position:0%
well i didn't realize that before
it's

05:34:53.190 --> 05:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:34:54.948 --> 05:34:54.958 align:start position:0%
just i understand too with something
 
05:34:56.628 --> 05:34:56.638 align:start position:0%
that would happen it also can affect the
 
05:34:59.430 --> 05:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
transfer even the value may go up but
 
05:35:01.190 --> 05:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
immediately speaking the restriction
 
05:35:03.590 --> 05:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
will transfer from these problems
 
05:35:17.990 --> 05:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:19.830 --> 05:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
represent a board
 
05:35:21.190 --> 05:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
05:35:24.470 --> 05:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
um i will point out to you that uh
 
05:35:26.150 --> 05:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
05:35:27.510 --> 05:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
where he
 
05:35:30.230 --> 05:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
says that firearms are not allowed on
 
05:35:32.788 --> 05:35:32.798 align:start position:0%
school property unless you are carrying
 
05:35:35.990 --> 05:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
a concealed uh
 
05:35:36.000 --> 05:35:39.030 align:start position:0%
a concealed uh
permit

05:35:39.030 --> 05:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:41.830 --> 05:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
05:35:44.628 --> 05:35:44.638 align:start position:0%
say that school boards cannot
 
05:35:44.638 --> 05:35:45.910 align:start position:0%
say that school boards cannot
regulate

05:35:45.910 --> 05:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
05:35:50.470 --> 05:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh firearms on school property so
 
05:35:53.350 --> 05:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
the only way that school boards can
 
05:35:55.110 --> 05:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
really enforce
 
05:35:58.788 --> 05:35:58.798 align:start position:0%
a federal law about firearms is to call
 
05:36:15.110 --> 05:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:16.708 --> 05:36:16.718 align:start position:0%
but it also could be addressed or
 
05:36:18.788 --> 05:36:18.798 align:start position:0%
enforced if the state were to pass a law
 
05:36:18.798 --> 05:36:20.548 align:start position:0%
enforced if the state were to pass a law
if

05:36:20.548 --> 05:36:20.558 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:36:21.670 --> 05:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
that's something that the state can put
 
05:36:24.150 --> 05:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
into consideration
 
05:36:26.310 --> 05:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
representative uh klein knight you're
 
05:36:26.320 --> 05:36:28.548 align:start position:0%
representative uh klein knight you're
recognized

05:36:28.548 --> 05:36:28.558 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
05:36:31.190 --> 05:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank you so much i'm i'm really
 
05:36:33.110 --> 05:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
troubled by a lot of this testimony
 
05:36:35.270 --> 05:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
today because
 
05:36:37.590 --> 05:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
on one hand um
 
05:36:40.470 --> 05:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
i was informed and i got emails that
 
05:36:43.190 --> 05:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
made me really think you know um
 
05:36:45.350 --> 05:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
one of them representative burke replied
 
05:36:48.788 --> 05:36:48.798 align:start position:0%
to about um an asian-american woman that
 
05:36:50.948 --> 05:36:50.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't feel safe right now and
 
05:36:53.030 --> 05:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know wants to go out and just be
 
05:36:54.788 --> 05:36:54.798 align:start position:0%
able to purchase a gun
 
05:36:56.150 --> 05:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
um and i
 
05:36:58.230 --> 05:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
felt really
 
05:37:01.030 --> 05:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh sympathetic with her um
 
05:37:05.350 --> 05:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
because i err on the side of the victim
 
05:37:05.360 --> 05:37:06.230 align:start position:0%
because i err on the side of the victim
and

05:37:06.230 --> 05:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:37:07.910 --> 05:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's how both these bills were
 
05:37:10.868 --> 05:37:10.878 align:start position:0%
represented yet
 
05:37:13.430 --> 05:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
the biggest supporters
 
05:37:15.350 --> 05:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
made me feel like
 
05:37:15.360 --> 05:37:16.948 align:start position:0%
made me feel like
victims

05:37:16.948 --> 05:37:16.958 align:start position:0%
victims
 
05:37:20.150 --> 05:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
don't matter and that
 
05:37:21.990 --> 05:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's their responsibility to protect
 
05:37:24.310 --> 05:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
themselves and we're like we should just
 
05:37:26.548 --> 05:37:26.558 align:start position:0%
go ahead and fail them is is kind of
 
05:37:29.030 --> 05:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
like the the want over having a second
 
05:37:31.590 --> 05:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
or third or fifth gun
 
05:37:33.510 --> 05:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
outweighed the need to protect the
 
05:37:36.230 --> 05:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
domestic violence dispute really
 
05:37:38.150 --> 05:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
troubled me
 
05:37:41.830 --> 05:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
and then when the uh coalition for
 
05:37:44.310 --> 05:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
victims and sexual violence testified
 
05:37:46.708 --> 05:37:46.718 align:start position:0%
against the bill that really
 
05:37:49.990 --> 05:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
brought my okay are we listening to them
 
05:37:51.190 --> 05:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:37:54.310 --> 05:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
i'm saying we're on one senate 154 not
 
05:37:56.628 --> 05:37:56.638 align:start position:0%
141. it's okay i'm tying them all
 
05:37:59.270 --> 05:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
together i'll get there and then
 
05:37:59.280 --> 05:38:00.230 align:start position:0%
together i'll get there and then
uh

05:38:00.230 --> 05:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:38:03.110 --> 05:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
speak hearing testimony about
 
05:38:05.510 --> 05:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know an elected official
 
05:38:08.070 --> 05:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh say we shouldn't trust the biden
 
05:38:08.080 --> 05:38:09.430 align:start position:0%
uh say we shouldn't trust the biden
administration

05:38:09.430 --> 05:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
administration
 
05:38:11.190 --> 05:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh because maybe they could take away
 
05:38:13.430 --> 05:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
our guns and all you know
 
05:38:16.070 --> 05:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know everybody's really fearful here
 
05:38:18.948 --> 05:38:18.958 align:start position:0%
but in the same breath we hear oh you
 
05:38:20.548 --> 05:38:20.558 align:start position:0%
know go ahead and let the federal
 
05:38:22.548 --> 05:38:22.558 align:start position:0%
government take care of this
 
05:38:24.708 --> 05:38:24.718 align:start position:0%
and with this bill in particular with
 
05:38:26.948 --> 05:38:26.958 align:start position:0%
representative bordenay just brought up
 
05:38:29.590 --> 05:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
is we could be potentially losing
 
05:38:31.190 --> 05:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands millions of
 
05:38:33.910 --> 05:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
dollars in school federal funding
 
05:38:36.948 --> 05:38:36.958 align:start position:0%
because we haven't done our homework and
 
05:38:39.750 --> 05:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
is the want for
 
05:38:42.470 --> 05:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
another gun that more important than
 
05:38:44.868 --> 05:38:44.878 align:start position:0%
victims school children and all this
 
05:38:46.788 --> 05:38:46.798 align:start position:0%
other stuff that we haven't
 
05:38:46.798 --> 05:38:48.150 align:start position:0%
other stuff that we haven't
really

05:38:48.150 --> 05:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:38:49.670 --> 05:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
researched enough
 
05:38:51.750 --> 05:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
and it comes down to us the buck stops
 
05:38:55.270 --> 05:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
here what is our responsibility
 
05:38:57.350 --> 05:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
and um i just find it really
 
05:38:59.510 --> 05:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
hypocritical of
 
05:39:02.070 --> 05:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
of the argument to be don't trust
 
05:39:04.868 --> 05:39:04.878 align:start position:0%
the federal government but then let's
 
05:39:07.350 --> 05:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
shirk our own state responsibilities
 
05:39:09.670 --> 05:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
because it's their responsibility to
 
05:39:11.750 --> 05:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
take care of us i'm very confused and i
 
05:39:14.150 --> 05:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
don't think that argument should be
 
05:39:15.670 --> 05:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
you know looked at both ways when it
 
05:39:17.670 --> 05:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
just suits us
 
05:39:19.750 --> 05:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
we have a responsibility
 
05:39:22.070 --> 05:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
i think to public safety
 
05:39:26.708 --> 05:39:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:29.190 --> 05:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:33.030 --> 05:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
i i i appreciate the comments and that i
 
05:39:34.868 --> 05:39:34.878 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying
 
05:39:36.708 --> 05:39:36.718 align:start position:0%
all right representative barry you're
 
05:39:39.270 --> 05:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak on the amendment
 
05:39:42.788 --> 05:39:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:45.590 --> 05:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
well i did find the case it's prince
 
05:39:45.600 --> 05:39:47.910 align:start position:0%

05:39:53.280 --> 05:39:55.948 align:start position:0%

05:39:57.830 --> 05:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
1997
 
05:40:00.070 --> 05:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
specifically allows states to not
 
05:40:03.110 --> 05:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
enforce federal governments
 
05:40:05.030 --> 05:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
it was brought to the supreme court and
 
05:40:07.670 --> 05:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
they found in our favor
 
05:40:09.190 --> 05:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
you know because they were trying to
 
05:40:11.750 --> 05:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
enforce the brady act and
 
05:40:13.910 --> 05:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
the supreme court said that that is not
 
05:40:18.788 --> 05:40:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:21.910 --> 05:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
i'm in support of this bill
 
05:40:21.920 --> 05:40:22.948 align:start position:0%
i'm in support of this bill
and

05:40:22.948 --> 05:40:22.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:40:24.628 --> 05:40:24.638 align:start position:0%
i'm glad that representative knight
 
05:40:26.390 --> 05:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
brought up that lady that emailed me
 
05:40:28.788 --> 05:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
because i forgot you know i remembered
 
05:40:29.990 --> 05:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
this morning about it i was thinking
 
05:40:33.510 --> 05:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
about it but then i forgot over the day
 
05:40:36.470 --> 05:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
but i want her right
 
05:40:40.230 --> 05:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
to be able if she chooses to purchase a
 
05:40:42.948 --> 05:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
nun to protect herself in this state or
 
05:40:44.948 --> 05:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
anywhere else in the united states i
 
05:40:46.390 --> 05:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
think it's her right
 
05:40:46.400 --> 05:40:47.190 align:start position:0%
think it's her right
and

05:40:47.190 --> 05:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:40:50.868 --> 05:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
this bill this amendment will
 
05:40:52.708 --> 05:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
allow that to happen
 
05:40:55.270 --> 05:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
so there is supreme court
 
05:40:57.750 --> 05:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
decisions on this
 
05:40:59.590 --> 05:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
i believe this will not be challenged or
 
05:41:00.788 --> 05:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
it will be challenged but it will be
 
05:41:02.230 --> 05:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
thrown out
 
05:41:04.868 --> 05:41:04.878 align:start position:0%
so as this passes i think it's a great
 
05:41:04.878 --> 05:41:06.868 align:start position:0%
so as this passes i think it's a great
thing

05:41:06.868 --> 05:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:41:09.270 --> 05:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
you know we live with some
 
05:41:12.948 --> 05:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
i think in new hampshire sanctuary uh
 
05:41:12.958 --> 05:41:14.390 align:start position:0%
i think in new hampshire sanctuary uh
cities

05:41:14.390 --> 05:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
cities
 
05:41:14.400 --> 05:41:15.110 align:start position:0%
cities
and

05:41:15.110 --> 05:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:41:17.270 --> 05:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
i guess that's okay but
 
05:41:19.590 --> 05:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
this isn't for some reason so i guess
 
05:41:21.910 --> 05:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of lost there but i just want
 
05:41:24.230 --> 05:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
to point out that we do have sanctuaries
 
05:41:27.270 --> 05:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:29.190 --> 05:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
you're not recognizing the speech
 
05:41:31.190 --> 05:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
you're out of order
 
05:41:33.110 --> 05:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
now the bill did die on the house i
 
05:41:34.948 --> 05:41:34.958 align:start position:0%
didn't die it was retained on the house
 
05:41:37.510 --> 05:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
floor down in bedford and uh we are
 
05:41:39.910 --> 05:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
going to work on that over the summer
 
05:41:43.030 --> 05:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
to see how we can address that issue
 
05:41:46.548 --> 05:41:46.558 align:start position:0%
this bill is spot on it's a good bill i
 
05:41:48.310 --> 05:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
support it and i hope you guys do too
 
05:41:50.788 --> 05:41:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:52.708 --> 05:41:52.718 align:start position:0%
thank you're indicating that some cities
 
05:41:55.030 --> 05:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
are not enforcing federal laws
 
05:41:56.310 --> 05:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
05:41:57.910 --> 05:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative welch there are some
 
05:42:00.230 --> 05:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
cities that say mountain forces
 
05:42:02.788 --> 05:42:02.798 align:start position:0%
are lost i understand
 
05:42:05.670 --> 05:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
that and they i can appreciate that
 
05:42:06.948 --> 05:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
that's similar to the knowledge i made
 
05:42:09.510 --> 05:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
with with the cannabis laws yes
 
05:42:09.520 --> 05:42:10.708 align:start position:0%
with with the cannabis laws yes
even

05:42:10.708 --> 05:42:10.718 align:start position:0%
even
 
05:42:12.708 --> 05:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
even therapeutic candidates which i i
 
05:42:14.310 --> 05:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
support and i believe there's a lot of
 
05:42:14.320 --> 05:42:15.750 align:start position:0%
support and i believe there's a lot of
positives

05:42:15.750 --> 05:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
positives
 
05:42:17.350 --> 05:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
and we just
 
05:42:18.628 --> 05:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
at the tip of the iceberg with the
 
05:42:21.270 --> 05:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
benefits of therapy to cannabis
 
05:42:24.150 --> 05:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
but that's still against federal law
 
05:42:26.628 --> 05:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
and you know here in new hampshire
 
05:42:29.110 --> 05:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
yes right tip the iceberg we're not
 
05:42:30.548 --> 05:42:30.558 align:start position:0%
we're permitting that that happened that
 
05:42:30.558 --> 05:42:31.990 align:start position:0%
we're permitting that that happened that
is

05:42:31.990 --> 05:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:42:34.470 --> 05:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
in violation of federal law and
 
05:42:36.310 --> 05:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
we're just the state's policies we're
 
05:42:37.910 --> 05:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
just not going to enforce that federal
 
05:42:39.510 --> 05:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
you know we're not going to enforce that
 
05:42:41.110 --> 05:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
the state if the federal government came
 
05:42:42.150 --> 05:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
in and
 
05:42:43.910 --> 05:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
decided out of nowhere and they haven't
 
05:42:47.030 --> 05:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:48.708 --> 05:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
may i just have one you know three
 
05:42:51.510 --> 05:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
seconds let me just i appreciate that uh
 
05:42:54.310 --> 05:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
mr chairman uh
 
05:42:56.390 --> 05:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
over the years my good friend you know
 
05:42:58.868 --> 05:42:58.878 align:start position:0%
representative welch and i you know
 
05:43:00.390 --> 05:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
we've been together in this committee
 
05:43:03.350 --> 05:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
for a long time and we
 
05:43:05.270 --> 05:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know we have voted
 
05:43:08.470 --> 05:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
to decrim marijuana against federal
 
05:43:08.480 --> 05:43:10.708 align:start position:0%
to decrim marijuana against federal
wishes

05:43:10.708 --> 05:43:10.718 align:start position:0%
wishes
 
05:43:13.430 --> 05:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
and i tell everybody
 
05:43:15.430 --> 05:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
i've never touched the stuff you do what
 
05:43:17.350 --> 05:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
you want none of my business what you do
 
05:43:19.110 --> 05:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
behind closed doors
 
05:43:21.270 --> 05:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
but i'm telling you that if you do it it
 
05:43:24.150 --> 05:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
is still against the federal laws
 
05:43:26.948 --> 05:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
and people like to still go forward with
 
05:43:29.030 --> 05:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
this types of legislation even though
 
05:43:31.110 --> 05:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
it's against the federal law and they're
 
05:43:33.270 --> 05:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
happy to
 
05:43:35.590 --> 05:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
buy their marijuana or their gummy bears
 
05:43:37.910 --> 05:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
or whatever they're buying with the um
 
05:43:40.628 --> 05:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
marijuana in it to help them you know if
 
05:43:42.150 --> 05:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
they got a medical card or even not a
 
05:43:44.150 --> 05:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
medical parent and i know some of them
 
05:43:45.750 --> 05:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
are still buying guns
 
05:43:45.760 --> 05:43:46.548 align:start position:0%
are still buying guns
well

05:43:46.548 --> 05:43:46.558 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:43:49.350 --> 05:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
there's two differences in just
 
05:43:51.670 --> 05:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
when they come to this recreational
 
05:43:53.110 --> 05:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
candidates the supreme court actually
 
05:43:55.270 --> 05:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
did rule on that and wrote a lot of the
 
05:43:57.110 --> 05:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
preemption laws that the
 
05:43:59.110 --> 05:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
feds can come in and
 
05:43:59.120 --> 05:44:00.868 align:start position:0%
feds can come in and
actually

05:44:00.868 --> 05:44:00.878 align:start position:0%
actually
 
05:44:03.110 --> 05:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
make the arrest of them yes so that's
 
05:44:04.548 --> 05:44:04.558 align:start position:0%
actually been decided by the supreme
 
05:44:06.390 --> 05:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
court where we're in the opposite here
 
05:44:08.628 --> 05:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
with firearms
 
05:44:09.910 --> 05:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
the other way around but again we're
 
05:44:11.510 --> 05:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
just not enforcing the law we're not
 
05:44:13.510 --> 05:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
getting we're not encouraging or
 
05:44:15.350 --> 05:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
violating anybody that would absolutely
 
05:44:16.868 --> 05:44:16.878 align:start position:0%
work right
 
05:44:19.110 --> 05:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
that would be a crime yes thank you mr
 
05:44:20.708 --> 05:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
chairman representative you're
 
05:44:20.718 --> 05:44:22.230 align:start position:0%
chairman representative you're
recognized

05:44:22.230 --> 05:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
05:44:23.750 --> 05:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr i kind of have a question
 
05:44:26.390 --> 05:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
for the chair um is it my understanding
 
05:44:28.390 --> 05:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
that when we're doing this it's uh it's
 
05:44:30.470 --> 05:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
not a debate back and forth that we just
 
05:44:32.150 --> 05:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
make our points and
 
05:44:34.788 --> 05:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
uh we move on and you recognize the next
 
05:44:34.798 --> 05:44:36.150 align:start position:0%
uh we move on and you recognize the next
person

05:44:36.150 --> 05:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
person
 
05:44:36.160 --> 05:44:37.430 align:start position:0%
person
so

05:44:37.430 --> 05:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:44:37.440 --> 05:44:39.030 align:start position:0%
so
although

05:44:39.030 --> 05:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
although
 
05:44:40.470 --> 05:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
you know mason's has two different
 
05:44:42.230 --> 05:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
references i didn't bring the book with
 
05:44:43.590 --> 05:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
me today but what
 
05:44:46.070 --> 05:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
even when you recognize someone to speak
 
05:44:47.350 --> 05:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
you're not supposed to recognize another
 
05:44:48.868 --> 05:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
person to speak until everyone's had an
 
05:44:51.190 --> 05:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak however it also
 
05:44:53.590 --> 05:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
encourages the healthy uh flow of
 
05:44:55.670 --> 05:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
discussion so provided people aren't
 
05:44:57.430 --> 05:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
yelling over each other and talking over
 
05:44:59.190 --> 05:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
each other and cutting each other off
 
05:45:01.030 --> 05:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
and it's extremely difficult if
 
05:45:02.708 --> 05:45:02.718 align:start position:0%
especially because with
 
05:45:04.868 --> 05:45:04.878 align:start position:0%
the digital hearing zoom there's always
 
05:45:04.878 --> 05:45:05.750 align:start position:0%
the digital hearing zoom there's always
a

05:45:05.750 --> 05:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:45:07.670 --> 05:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
half a second or a second delay that you
 
05:45:09.430 --> 05:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
can have three people yelling over each
 
05:45:10.708 --> 05:45:10.718 align:start position:0%
other so i wouldn't consider people
 
05:45:12.470 --> 05:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
yelling with each other to be
 
05:45:14.708 --> 05:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
healthy back and forth but if two
 
05:45:16.150 --> 05:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
members are talking about before i mean
 
05:45:18.070 --> 05:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative i asked him a question he
 
05:45:19.430 --> 05:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
responded to it
 
05:45:21.110 --> 05:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
and now i consider that to be a healthy
 
05:45:23.430 --> 05:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
back and forth and
 
05:45:25.750 --> 05:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's i believe it's within the
 
05:45:27.270 --> 05:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
discretion that you have to promote that
 
05:45:28.548 --> 05:45:28.558 align:start position:0%
it's not to exploit anyone from the
 
05:45:30.470 --> 05:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
conversation but as long as people
 
05:45:32.390 --> 05:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
members don't stop interrupting each
 
05:45:34.230 --> 05:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
other and yelling over each other
 
05:45:35.750 --> 05:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh i would hope that would be the
 
05:45:37.430 --> 05:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
practice and we've been really we could
 
05:45:39.510 --> 05:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
do that on every executive session that
 
05:45:40.470 --> 05:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
would really be the preference of the
 
05:45:40.480 --> 05:45:41.910 align:start position:0%
would really be the preference of the
chair

05:45:41.910 --> 05:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:45:43.670 --> 05:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:45:47.750 --> 05:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:49.030 --> 05:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
representing many recognized for
 
05:45:50.868 --> 05:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
parliament report
 
05:45:52.628 --> 05:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
yeah my inquiry would be would it be
 
05:45:54.628 --> 05:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
better in order to promote the
 
05:45:56.230 --> 05:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
communication that you were talking
 
05:45:57.510 --> 05:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
about i realize you don't have to
 
05:45:59.030 --> 05:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
recognize yourself for a question to
 
05:46:00.230 --> 05:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
someone else
 
05:46:02.070 --> 05:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
that we if we wanted to question
 
05:46:04.310 --> 05:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
somebody to to run that question through
 
05:46:07.990 --> 05:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:09.670 --> 05:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
if you wish to ask a question of a
 
05:46:11.270 --> 05:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
member you most certainly may raise your
 
05:46:14.230 --> 05:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
hand to ask a question to that member
 
05:46:16.310 --> 05:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying if there is a help
 
05:46:17.670 --> 05:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
you are on the committee and served with
 
05:46:19.590 --> 05:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
me last term and there was a different
 
05:46:21.910 --> 05:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
chair and that i would say that your i
 
05:46:24.230 --> 05:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
respect very much an excellent job of
 
05:46:25.430 --> 05:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
letting the members have healthy
 
05:46:25.440 --> 05:46:26.788 align:start position:0%
letting the members have healthy
conversations

05:46:26.788 --> 05:46:26.798 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
05:46:28.548 --> 05:46:28.558 align:start position:0%
even when we were very far apart on
 
05:46:30.708 --> 05:46:30.718 align:start position:0%
agreeing on on topics
 
05:46:32.310 --> 05:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh i don't i don't recall that you're
 
05:46:33.670 --> 05:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
having to
 
05:46:35.990 --> 05:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
gamble a member a single time last last
 
05:46:36.000 --> 05:46:37.030 align:start position:0%
gamble a member a single time last last
term

05:46:37.030 --> 05:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
term
 
05:46:39.270 --> 05:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
like in far i mean i didn't have perfect
 
05:46:40.868 --> 05:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
attendance so many capital i wasn't here
 
05:46:40.878 --> 05:46:41.670 align:start position:0%
attendance so many capital i wasn't here
but

05:46:41.670 --> 05:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:46:41.680 --> 05:46:42.548 align:start position:0%
but
uh

05:46:42.548 --> 05:46:42.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:46:44.868 --> 05:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
it can be done both ways and i think if
 
05:46:46.310 --> 05:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
as long as we're not yelling over each
 
05:46:48.150 --> 05:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
other or talking with each other
 
05:46:49.910 --> 05:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
and conducting ourselves professionally
 
05:46:51.430 --> 05:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
and maintaining the quorum that's the
 
05:46:53.590 --> 05:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
way to go
 
05:46:55.990 --> 05:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your response and and
 
05:46:57.350 --> 05:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
you're correct about the way we had
 
05:46:58.948 --> 05:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
conversations when everybody was there
 
05:47:00.708 --> 05:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
and everybody was in person
 
05:47:03.750 --> 05:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
but this term we've had more of a
 
05:47:06.628 --> 05:47:06.638 align:start position:0%
emphasis on parliamentary procedures in
 
05:47:08.788 --> 05:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
order to keep order because some people
 
05:47:11.110 --> 05:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
are not there and that's the only
 
05:47:13.350 --> 05:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
motivation behind my question to see
 
05:47:20.548 --> 05:47:20.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:20.558 --> 05:47:21.670 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:47:21.670 --> 05:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:47:27.430 --> 05:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:30.628 --> 05:47:30.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so i wanted to dial
 
05:47:33.590 --> 05:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
back to a statement that i made earlier
 
05:47:36.948 --> 05:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
about um i i believe that
 
05:47:39.590 --> 05:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
this amendment and the underlying bill
 
05:47:42.708 --> 05:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
would set new hampshire up for very
 
05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
lengthy and very expensive lawsuits and
 
05:47:47.750 --> 05:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to use an example that is
 
05:47:49.430 --> 05:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
happening right now
 
05:47:52.230 --> 05:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
so in arkansas
 
05:47:55.110 --> 05:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
arkansas governor asa hutchinson
 
05:48:00.628 --> 05:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:02.390 --> 05:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
and said that the measure would
 
05:48:04.070 --> 05:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
jeopardize law enforcement and the
 
05:48:04.080 --> 05:48:05.110 align:start position:0%
jeopardize law enforcement and the
public

05:48:05.110 --> 05:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:48:07.430 --> 05:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
and he his work his
 
05:48:09.590 --> 05:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
veto message was the partnership between
 
05:48:11.590 --> 05:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
state and federal law enforcement
 
05:48:14.150 --> 05:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
officers is essential for the safety of
 
05:48:16.628 --> 05:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
arkansas citizens this bill will break
 
05:48:18.548 --> 05:48:18.558 align:start position:0%
that partnership and put the safety of
 
05:48:21.190 --> 05:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
arkansas at risk and i believe that that
 
05:48:23.510 --> 05:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
applies to new hampshire as well
 
05:48:27.110 --> 05:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
so we all know that the republican
 
05:48:29.590 --> 05:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
led legislature
 
05:48:32.150 --> 05:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
that wants to
 
05:48:33.430 --> 05:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
pass this
 
05:48:36.628 --> 05:48:36.638 align:start position:0%
overrode his veto and now it goes to
 
05:48:39.190 --> 05:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
court so we would be looking at very
 
05:48:42.070 --> 05:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
similar if you know this were to pass we
 
05:48:45.110 --> 05:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
would get embroiled in um lawsuits very
 
05:48:49.030 --> 05:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
similar to that and i find it um
 
05:48:49.040 --> 05:48:50.230 align:start position:0%
similar to that and i find it um
troubling

05:48:50.230 --> 05:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
troubling
 
05:48:50.240 --> 05:48:51.030 align:start position:0%
troubling
that

05:48:51.030 --> 05:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:48:53.910 --> 05:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
this this amendment and this underlying
 
05:48:55.030 --> 05:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
bill this
 
05:48:57.270 --> 05:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
this measure to
 
05:48:57.280 --> 05:48:58.390 align:start position:0%
this measure to
um

05:48:58.390 --> 05:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:01.910 --> 05:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
try to nullify the federal government's
 
05:49:01.920 --> 05:49:05.430 align:start position:0%
try to nullify the federal government's
um

05:49:05.430 --> 05:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:05.440 --> 05:49:06.708 align:start position:0%
 
authority

05:49:06.708 --> 05:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
authority
 
05:49:09.430 --> 05:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh is b is happening
 
05:49:12.470 --> 05:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
in a dozen other states you know this
 
05:49:16.310 --> 05:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
isn't this isn't um original it's not
 
05:49:16.320 --> 05:49:17.270 align:start position:0%
isn't this isn't um original it's not
new

05:49:17.270 --> 05:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
new
 
05:49:21.510 --> 05:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
um and it's being presented in alabama
 
05:49:24.708 --> 05:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
arkansas which you know is now beyond
 
05:49:26.628 --> 05:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
this and into the lawsuit stage it's in
 
05:49:30.150 --> 05:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
nebraska oklahoma it's in south carolina

arizona they're looking to pass
 
05:49:51.270 --> 05:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
um pass a bill very similar to this too
 
05:49:52.868 --> 05:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
05:49:52.878 --> 05:49:54.708 align:start position:0%
what is the
why

05:49:54.708 --> 05:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
why
 
05:49:57.190 --> 05:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
why is there um a sudden
 
05:49:57.200 --> 05:49:58.470 align:start position:0%
why is there um a sudden
interest

05:49:58.470 --> 05:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
interest
 
05:50:01.670 --> 05:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
in um wanting to pass these bills that
 
05:50:04.708 --> 05:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
are absolutely going to embroil us in
 
05:50:04.718 --> 05:50:06.070 align:start position:0%
are absolutely going to embroil us in
litigation

05:50:06.070 --> 05:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
05:50:08.070 --> 05:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:50:11.670 --> 05:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
potentially put our citizens in danger
 
05:50:15.270 --> 05:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
and and absolutely drive a wedge
 
05:50:18.070 --> 05:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
into the cooperation that should be
 
05:50:19.830 --> 05:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
happening between
 
05:50:22.470 --> 05:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
our local law enforcement and state
 
05:50:22.480 --> 05:50:23.430 align:start position:0%
our local law enforcement and state
police

05:50:23.430 --> 05:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
police
 
05:50:26.310 --> 05:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
and federal officials if there were to
 
05:50:26.320 --> 05:50:27.110 align:start position:0%
and federal officials if there were to
be

05:50:27.110 --> 05:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:50:29.270 --> 05:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
um a tragedy
 
05:50:29.280 --> 05:50:31.030 align:start position:0%
um a tragedy
so

05:50:31.030 --> 05:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:50:32.948 --> 05:50:32.958 align:start position:0%
what does this what does this what
 
05:50:35.910 --> 05:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
problem does this solve
 
05:50:37.670 --> 05:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
because it seems like it just makes more
 
05:50:37.680 --> 05:50:40.230 align:start position:0%
because it seems like it just makes more
problems

05:50:40.230 --> 05:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:41.830 --> 05:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
a tragedy
 
05:50:43.670 --> 05:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
in you know some type of gun violence
 
05:50:45.670 --> 05:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's already against state law and i
 
05:50:45.680 --> 05:50:46.390 align:start position:0%
that's already against state law and i
hope

05:50:46.390 --> 05:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
hope
 
05:50:46.400 --> 05:50:47.270 align:start position:0%
hope
that

05:50:47.270 --> 05:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:50:49.670 --> 05:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
state county municipal federal officers
 
05:50:51.190 --> 05:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
even if it's interstate would all work
 
05:50:51.200 --> 05:50:52.628 align:start position:0%
even if it's interstate would all work
together

05:50:52.628 --> 05:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
together
 
05:50:54.548 --> 05:50:54.558 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any statement that that
 
05:50:57.590 --> 05:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
would be legal and
 
05:50:59.510 --> 05:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
going back to the discussion
 
05:51:01.110 --> 05:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
representative part and representative
 
05:51:03.110 --> 05:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
welch and i we're kind of having
 
05:51:06.150 --> 05:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
his other laws that federal laws that
 
05:51:08.070 --> 05:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
it becomes a policy that will not be
 
05:51:09.910 --> 05:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
enforced whether it's
 
05:51:11.430 --> 05:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
immigration whether it's on some of the
 
05:51:13.670 --> 05:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
federal uh laws related to controlled
 
05:51:15.830 --> 05:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
substances so
 
05:51:18.470 --> 05:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's been done before and
 
05:51:19.990 --> 05:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
but that's not what we're talking about
 
05:51:22.310 --> 05:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's not germane to this bill we're
 
05:51:24.948 --> 05:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
talking about specifically this bill
 
05:51:24.958 --> 05:51:26.548 align:start position:0%
talking about specifically this bill
specifically

05:51:26.548 --> 05:51:26.558 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
05:51:29.510 --> 05:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
speaks of firearms ammunition magazines
 
05:51:31.830 --> 05:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
ammunition feeding devices firearm
 
05:51:35.750 --> 05:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
components firearm supplies or knives
 
05:51:38.708 --> 05:51:38.718 align:start position:0%
so um you know has a very very narrow
 
05:51:38.718 --> 05:51:40.390 align:start position:0%
so um you know has a very very narrow
scope

05:51:40.390 --> 05:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
scope
 
05:51:42.070 --> 05:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
05:51:44.948 --> 05:51:44.958 align:start position:0%
so that's that's in in both of these in
 
05:51:47.190 --> 05:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
the underlying and the amendment super
 
05:51:49.750 --> 05:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
narrow i can clarify that i can clarify
 
05:51:52.150 --> 05:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
the analogy the analogy is that any
 
05:51:54.390 --> 05:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
federal firearm regulations and compared
 
05:51:56.548 --> 05:51:56.558 align:start position:0%
to any federal immigration regulations
 
05:51:58.948 --> 05:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
or any federal uh
 
05:52:00.788 --> 05:52:00.798 align:start position:0%
regulations of laws related to control
 
05:52:02.628 --> 05:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
services we're comparing those in power
 
05:52:03.910 --> 05:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
that the state
 
05:52:05.830 --> 05:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
chooses to adopt them uh follow them or
 
05:52:07.670 --> 05:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
enforce them or not that's the analogy
 
05:52:08.788 --> 05:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
we're not saying that they're the exact
 
05:52:10.628 --> 05:52:10.638 align:start position:0%
same subject
 
05:52:13.110 --> 05:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
the philosophy of not
 
05:52:15.270 --> 05:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh enforcing the federal law the state
 
05:52:16.390 --> 05:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
level is something that's been done
 
05:52:19.990 --> 05:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
before in other areas of law unrelated
 
05:52:24.628 --> 05:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:26.310 --> 05:52:26.320 align:start position:0%

06:00:37.350 --> 06:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
that the motion got any speed the
 
06:00:39.750 --> 06:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
legislative uh second by representative
 
06:00:41.030 --> 06:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
board name
 
06:00:42.548 --> 06:00:42.558 align:start position:0%
or john do you wish to speak to your
 
06:00:42.558 --> 06:00:45.190 align:start position:0%
or john do you wish to speak to your
motion

06:00:45.190 --> 06:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:45.200 --> 06:00:46.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:00:46.390 --> 06:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:48.470 --> 06:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
i make that motion because i think that
 
06:00:50.390 --> 06:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
the uh there are several problems with
 
06:00:53.110 --> 06:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
the bill the way it's written um
 
06:00:54.948 --> 06:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
even though it has good intentions and
 
06:00:57.510 --> 06:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
it came from a 17 year old student i i
 
06:00:59.270 --> 06:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
believe some of the testimony that we
 
06:00:59.280 --> 06:01:00.948 align:start position:0%
believe some of the testimony that we
had

06:01:00.948 --> 06:01:00.958 align:start position:0%
had
 
06:01:03.990 --> 06:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
that the there's i see problems with the
 
06:01:07.030 --> 06:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
deputizing of people to take that action
 
06:01:08.868 --> 06:01:08.878 align:start position:0%
based on some of the testimony we had
 
06:01:08.878 --> 06:01:09.830 align:start position:0%
based on some of the testimony we had
from

06:01:09.830 --> 06:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:01:12.830 --> 06:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
police officers um it's difficult
 
06:01:16.150 --> 06:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
to determine extreme temperatures and
 
06:01:17.590 --> 06:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
even uh
 
06:01:20.230 --> 06:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
i think one of our committee members who
 
06:01:22.070 --> 06:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
enforce these types of laws made
 
06:01:24.230 --> 06:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
comments about um
 
06:01:27.270 --> 06:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
how difficult it is for a trained law
 
06:01:29.110 --> 06:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer to make those kind
 
06:01:30.708 --> 06:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
of decisions
 
06:01:32.070 --> 06:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:01:35.350 --> 06:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
and getting the witness and being
 
06:01:37.670 --> 06:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
able to get information from somebody to
 
06:01:40.788 --> 06:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
be a witness and and all of that
 
06:01:40.798 --> 06:01:41.670 align:start position:0%
be a witness and and all of that
just

06:01:41.670 --> 06:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:01:44.390 --> 06:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
make makes this a lot uh one that would
 
06:01:47.110 --> 06:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
be very very difficult to enforce and
 
06:01:50.070 --> 06:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps put people at uh
 
06:01:51.510 --> 06:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
in like a
 
06:01:53.510 --> 06:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
a situation where they are liable for
 
06:01:56.868 --> 06:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
damages and stuff like that because of
 
06:01:58.948 --> 06:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
um not meeting all the requirements that
 
06:02:01.750 --> 06:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
are in the in the proposed law
 
06:02:05.190 --> 06:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:06.948 --> 06:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
06:02:09.190 --> 06:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
i agree that
 
06:02:11.670 --> 06:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
senator 110 is was
 
06:02:14.310 --> 06:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
very well intended that
 
06:02:16.470 --> 06:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
raises the concern of the animals being
 
06:02:18.070 --> 06:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
left in
 
06:02:19.830 --> 06:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
inside rock inside vehicles when there's
 
06:02:21.270 --> 06:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
extreme temperatures whether that's hot
 
06:02:24.150 --> 06:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
or cold
 
06:02:26.628 --> 06:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
my concern was just again despite how
 
06:02:28.230 --> 06:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
well intended it is
 
06:02:30.628 --> 06:02:30.638 align:start position:0%
the intent was the bill it's
 
06:02:33.190 --> 06:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
if someone is breaking the car even if
 
06:02:35.030 --> 06:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
the deputies are doing themselves
 
06:02:36.788 --> 06:02:36.798 align:start position:0%
because they're authorized by
 
06:02:39.030 --> 06:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
police to do so it could
 
06:02:40.708 --> 06:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
turn into a pretty chaotic situation if
 
06:02:42.628 --> 06:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
the owner vehicle
 
06:02:44.070 --> 06:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
did come outside while you were doing
 
06:02:45.990 --> 06:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
that despite your justification and
 
06:02:47.990 --> 06:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
being justified just seeing that that
 
06:02:48.000 --> 06:02:51.030 align:start position:0%
being justified just seeing that that
situation

06:02:51.030 --> 06:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:52.788 --> 06:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
being turning into a misunderstanding
 
06:02:57.190 --> 06:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:59.670 --> 06:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
it's a concern that i have that as we
 
06:03:01.910 --> 06:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
would obviously right now if you did
 
06:03:03.030 --> 06:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
call the police and some of that
 
06:03:04.708 --> 06:03:04.718 align:start position:0%
happened the police
 
06:03:06.548 --> 06:03:06.558 align:start position:0%
would authorize you to break the window
 
06:03:08.628 --> 06:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
uh you could actually do something you
 
06:03:10.788 --> 06:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
would be i mean

06:08:36.868 --> 06:08:36.878 align:start position:0%
boarding is referring to senate bill
 
06:08:36.878 --> 06:08:38.628 align:start position:0%
boarding is referring to senate bill
122.

06:08:38.628 --> 06:08:38.638 align:start position:0%
122.
 
06:08:38.638 --> 06:08:39.510 align:start position:0%
122.
yes

06:08:39.510 --> 06:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:08:46.628 --> 06:08:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:48.948 --> 06:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
and increasing the penalties i think
 
06:08:54.708 --> 06:08:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:56.708 --> 06:08:56.718 align:start position:0%
increasing ponies for harm in a service
 
06:08:59.510 --> 06:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
animal um those are the new areas in
 
06:09:03.110 --> 06:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
this bill the other bill parts are all
 
06:09:05.270 --> 06:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh bills that the house has already
 
06:09:05.280 --> 06:09:07.350 align:start position:0%
uh bills that the house has already
passed

06:09:07.350 --> 06:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
passed
 
06:09:09.750 --> 06:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering if we want to
 
06:09:12.948 --> 06:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
reduce the bill to the
 
06:09:12.958 --> 06:09:13.750 align:start position:0%
reduce the bill to the
new

06:09:13.750 --> 06:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
new
 
06:09:15.670 --> 06:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh parts of the
 
06:09:19.110 --> 06:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:19.120 --> 06:09:19.910 align:start position:0%
 
i

06:09:19.910 --> 06:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:09:22.390 --> 06:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
i support any bill house bill that
 
06:09:24.708 --> 06:09:24.718 align:start position:0%
passed in this body uh especially out of
 
06:09:26.548 --> 06:09:26.558 align:start position:0%
this committee i want to sound too
 
06:09:26.558 --> 06:09:27.830 align:start position:0%
this committee i want to sound too
biased

06:09:27.830 --> 06:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
biased
 
06:09:31.110 --> 06:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
that can pass on on its own as a stand
 
06:09:31.120 --> 06:09:31.990 align:start position:0%
that can pass on on its own as a stand
alone

06:09:31.990 --> 06:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
alone
 
06:09:34.708 --> 06:09:34.718 align:start position:0%
i would prefer that to pass rather than
 
06:09:37.830 --> 06:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
mix it in with an ominous bill
 
06:09:39.670 --> 06:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
there's certain
 
06:09:41.510 --> 06:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
i don't want someone to vote against the
 
06:09:43.350 --> 06:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
bill because of one section
 
06:09:44.948 --> 06:09:44.958 align:start position:0%
and you have three sections that are
 
06:09:47.270 --> 06:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
completely unrelated so i would
 
06:09:48.788 --> 06:09:48.798 align:start position:0%
certainly encourage that and then the
 
06:09:52.230 --> 06:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
optics you only want to pass
 
06:09:54.470 --> 06:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
the same build twice
 
06:09:56.310 --> 06:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
so they both get signs of loss whatever
 
06:09:58.150 --> 06:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
left side second to
 
06:10:02.548 --> 06:10:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:05.750 --> 06:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
senate bill 40 which we have
 
06:10:08.948 --> 06:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
that's mirrored of hd 45 that 45 is
 
06:10:11.670 --> 06:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
passed so i'm just monitoring
 
06:10:13.670 --> 06:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
i've been just checking to see check the
 
06:10:14.948 --> 06:10:14.958 align:start position:0%
docking and what the set has been doing
 
06:10:16.230 --> 06:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
with those
 
06:10:16.240 --> 06:10:16.948 align:start position:0%
with those
so

06:10:16.948 --> 06:10:16.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:10:18.788 --> 06:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
by our next hearing aid we might have a
 
06:10:18.798 --> 06:10:29.270 align:start position:0%
by our next hearing aid we might have a
better

06:10:29.270 --> 06:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:32.150 --> 06:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
mr chair i think that the raising the
 
06:10:34.310 --> 06:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
felony for harming a service dog is
 
06:10:38.310 --> 06:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
probably uh the most uh
 
06:10:40.230 --> 06:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
something we really didn't debate very
 
06:10:40.240 --> 06:10:41.270 align:start position:0%
something we really didn't debate very
much

06:10:41.270 --> 06:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
much
 
06:10:41.280 --> 06:10:42.470 align:start position:0%
much
so

06:10:42.470 --> 06:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:10:44.868 --> 06:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to offer an amendment for
 
06:10:47.590 --> 06:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
the bill that offers the uh
 
06:10:49.830 --> 06:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
great grandparents as part of the
 
06:10:51.270 --> 06:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
guardian train
 
06:10:51.280 --> 06:10:52.470 align:start position:0%
guardian train
and

06:10:52.470 --> 06:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:10:52.480 --> 06:10:53.910 align:start position:0%
and
the

06:10:53.910 --> 06:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:10:55.510 --> 06:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
council on
 
06:11:10.230 --> 06:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:11.670 --> 06:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
make that the bill
 
06:11:14.310 --> 06:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
take out the other uh parts that we've
 
06:11:18.230 --> 06:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:21.430 --> 06:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
it's as despicable as it is to abuse a
 
06:11:23.670 --> 06:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
service dog it's still animal abuse
 
06:11:26.948 --> 06:11:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:26.958 --> 06:11:28.070 align:start position:0%
 
it's

06:11:28.070 --> 06:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:11:29.590 --> 06:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
my understanding what that section does
 
06:11:31.270 --> 06:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
is just create a separate classification
 
06:11:34.230 --> 06:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
if the dog is a service dog
 
06:11:34.240 --> 06:11:36.150 align:start position:0%
if the dog is a service dog
it's

06:11:36.150 --> 06:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:11:38.470 --> 06:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
still falling in the cruelty nonetheless
 
06:11:38.480 --> 06:11:39.270 align:start position:0%
still falling in the cruelty nonetheless
so

06:11:39.270 --> 06:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:11:40.868 --> 06:11:40.878 align:start position:0%
if that part were taken out it's not
 
06:11:55.350 --> 06:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:58.708 --> 06:11:58.718 align:start position:0%
it's enhancing the penalty for uh herme
 
06:12:00.628 --> 06:12:00.638 align:start position:0%
harming a service dog
 
06:12:03.590 --> 06:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
um i'm not quite willing to go to a a
 
06:12:06.390 --> 06:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
felony for that
 
06:12:07.910 --> 06:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
the way it was written
 
06:12:09.190 --> 06:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
is that and
 
06:12:11.030 --> 06:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
also independent
 
06:12:12.628 --> 06:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
the animal is able to continue being a
 
06:12:15.990 --> 06:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:18.150 --> 06:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
you know you and i are firefighters
 
06:12:18.160 --> 06:12:19.110 align:start position:0%
you know you and i are firefighters
so

06:12:19.110 --> 06:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:12:20.310 --> 06:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
and then
 
06:12:22.310 --> 06:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
if i offer this amendment when are we
 
06:12:24.390 --> 06:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
going to have an exact session so i can
 
06:12:29.110 --> 06:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:29.120 --> 06:12:31.030 align:start position:0%
 
well

06:12:31.030 --> 06:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:12:38.230 --> 06:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:41.350 --> 06:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
next wednesday we we will not be meeting
 
06:12:43.410 --> 06:12:43.420 align:start position:0%
next next week we will be meeting
 
06:12:43.420 --> 06:12:44.628 align:start position:0%
next next week we will be meeting

so that's that's when you want to try to
 
06:12:54.628 --> 06:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
make sure you have any
 
06:12:57.430 --> 06:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
amendments prepared
 
06:12:59.510 --> 06:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
if uh just give me a moment with senate
 
06:13:01.190 --> 06:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
bill warnings
 
06:13:04.548 --> 06:13:04.558 align:start position:0%
you say monday the 10th yeah thank you
 
06:13:11.350 --> 06:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:14.390 --> 06:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh mr chair i will send you uh a copy of
 
06:13:17.110 --> 06:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh when it's when it's
 
06:13:17.120 --> 06:13:18.390 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh when it's when it's
written

06:13:18.390 --> 06:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
written
 
06:13:20.788 --> 06:13:20.798 align:start position:0%
representative while we're having a very
 
06:13:22.948 --> 06:13:22.958 align:start position:0%
healthy conversation
 
06:13:24.548 --> 06:13:24.558 align:start position:0%
with senate bill
 
06:13:24.558 --> 06:13:26.948 align:start position:0%
with senate bill
122

06:13:26.948 --> 06:13:26.958 align:start position:0%
122
 
06:13:31.590 --> 06:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:31.600 --> 06:13:41.590 align:start position:0%
 
remember

06:13:41.590 --> 06:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:43.750 --> 06:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
that has to do with allowing a person
 
06:13:45.270 --> 06:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
charged with driving or operating the
 
06:13:47.110 --> 06:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
influence of drugs or liquor to register
 
06:13:48.628 --> 06:13:48.638 align:start position:0%
for the impaired driving education
 
06:13:48.638 --> 06:14:15.750 align:start position:0%
for the impaired driving education
program

06:14:15.750 --> 06:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:15.760 --> 06:14:24.330 align:start position:0%
 
conversation

06:14:24.330 --> 06:14:24.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:24.340 --> 06:14:29.350 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:14:29.350 --> 06:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:31.670 --> 06:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
is there any concerns that you have with
 
06:14:33.030 --> 06:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
the very first section
 
06:14:33.040 --> 06:14:34.070 align:start position:0%
the very first section
[Music]

06:14:34.070 --> 06:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:14:36.868 --> 06:14:36.878 align:start position:0%
which involves
 
06:14:41.270 --> 06:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:43.750 --> 06:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
the impediment but i think that we've
 
06:14:46.150 --> 06:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
already handled driving under the
 
06:14:50.310 --> 06:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
influence of drugs uh earlier bill
 
06:14:52.070 --> 06:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
yes but that that was different what
 
06:14:54.310 --> 06:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
this has to do is if normally if you are
 
06:14:55.990 --> 06:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
convicted you would that's as part of
 
06:14:57.830 --> 06:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
the conviction you take
 
06:15:00.310 --> 06:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
the impaired driving education program
 
06:15:02.548 --> 06:15:02.558 align:start position:0%
all this allows you to do is not if
 
06:15:03.750 --> 06:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
while your
 
06:15:05.190 --> 06:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
charges are pending you can still
 
06:15:07.350 --> 06:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
actually enroll in the program
 
06:15:09.590 --> 06:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
you don't actually have to
 
06:15:10.948 --> 06:15:10.958 align:start position:0%
there can be a scenario where you are
 
06:15:14.470 --> 06:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
found guilty or excuse me not guilty
 
06:15:16.310 --> 06:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
but still have taken the
 
06:15:16.320 --> 06:15:17.510 align:start position:0%
but still have taken the
program

06:15:17.510 --> 06:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:15:19.030 --> 06:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
and that this would be what it is but it
 
06:15:22.868 --> 06:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow someone to finish up their
 
06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
wrap up their probation faster
 
06:15:26.948 --> 06:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
if they can get ahead of things
 
06:15:29.670 --> 06:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
i assume that that wouldn't imply any
 
06:15:32.150 --> 06:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
guilt on behalf of the person doing that
 
06:15:33.430 --> 06:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
but i'm not you have any problem with
 
06:15:35.990 --> 06:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
that provision
 
06:15:38.390 --> 06:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
during the hearing on that bill we did
 
06:15:40.868 --> 06:15:40.878 align:start position:0%
not hear anybody testify towards that
 
06:15:43.030 --> 06:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
part of the bill at all
 
06:15:47.030 --> 06:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:48.470 --> 06:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
anyone else second thoughts i i
 
06:15:50.708 --> 06:15:50.718 align:start position:0%
personally i think it's actually it's if
 
06:15:52.470 --> 06:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
someone first of all someone wants to
 
06:15:55.430 --> 06:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
attend say that type of program
 
06:15:57.110 --> 06:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
regardless of the outcome of their case
 
06:16:00.070 --> 06:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it doesn't hurt i can tell you
 
06:16:02.310 --> 06:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
that people are found not guilty
 
06:16:04.708 --> 06:16:04.718 align:start position:0%
this means that the government or the
 
06:16:06.708 --> 06:16:06.718 align:start position:0%
state cannot meet that burden of proof
 
06:16:06.718 --> 06:16:08.070 align:start position:0%
state cannot meet that burden of proof
sometimes

06:16:08.070 --> 06:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
06:16:09.110 --> 06:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that person didn't
 
06:16:10.708 --> 06:16:10.718 align:start position:0%
necessarily get me wrong so it doesn't
 
06:16:13.110 --> 06:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
hurt to happen first to take the course
 
06:16:15.270 --> 06:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
if they voluntarily voluntarily chose to
 
06:16:17.590 --> 06:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
do so by their conviction normally you
 
06:16:18.708 --> 06:16:18.718 align:start position:0%
have to have the
 
06:16:20.150 --> 06:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
disposition of the case show that
 
06:16:21.830 --> 06:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
paperwork you enroll
 
06:16:32.070 --> 06:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:34.150 --> 06:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
i don't want to mention any names but i
 
06:16:36.830 --> 06:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
have heard people say
 
06:16:38.150 --> 06:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
06:16:40.548 --> 06:16:40.558 align:start position:0%
they object to a
 
06:16:41.750 --> 06:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
bunch of
 
06:16:44.310 --> 06:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
unrelated bills
 
06:16:44.320 --> 06:16:46.150 align:start position:0%
unrelated bills
being

06:16:46.150 --> 06:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
being
 
06:16:47.830 --> 06:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
thrown together
 
06:16:50.470 --> 06:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
and crossed our way
 
06:16:50.480 --> 06:16:52.310 align:start position:0%
and crossed our way
as

06:16:52.310 --> 06:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
as
 
06:16:55.270 --> 06:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
has totally said
 
06:16:57.190 --> 06:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
i don't believe section one was
 
06:16:58.868 --> 06:16:58.878 align:start position:0%
discussed at all
 
06:17:00.948 --> 06:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
and that's why this person i was talking
 
06:17:03.430 --> 06:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
to objects to these
 
06:17:05.990 --> 06:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
multi unrelated bills being grouped
 
06:17:06.000 --> 06:17:07.750 align:start position:0%
multi unrelated bills being grouped
together

06:17:07.750 --> 06:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
together
 
06:17:09.990 --> 06:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
is because every bill doesn't get an
 
06:17:10.000 --> 06:17:10.868 align:start position:0%
is because every bill doesn't get an
error

06:17:10.868 --> 06:17:10.878 align:start position:0%
error
 
06:17:13.590 --> 06:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
so so that one gotta hear it i just said
 
06:17:16.230 --> 06:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
you know what he was there
 
06:17:18.868 --> 06:17:18.878 align:start position:0%
so all i'm saying is these are all
 
06:17:24.070 --> 06:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:26.868 --> 06:17:26.878 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe maybe pick 12 right
 
06:17:28.230 --> 06:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
all i'm saying is
 
06:17:30.310 --> 06:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
i think there are people who will vote
 
06:17:30.320 --> 06:17:32.708 align:start position:0%
i think there are people who will vote
against

06:17:32.708 --> 06:17:32.718 align:start position:0%
against
 
06:17:32.718 --> 06:17:44.470 align:start position:0%
against
this

06:17:44.470 --> 06:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:48.390 --> 06:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate that and that's what i
 
06:17:51.190 --> 06:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
will say is hypothetically if i was i
 
06:17:52.788 --> 06:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
really enjoyed that provision i wouldn't
 
06:17:54.070 --> 06:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
let i wouldn't
 
06:17:55.670 --> 06:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
i guess take it out gets taken out i put
 
06:17:57.430 --> 06:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
all this file
 
06:17:59.830 --> 06:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
until next next year creating the same
 
06:17:59.840 --> 06:18:00.830 align:start position:0%
until next next year creating the same
policy

06:18:00.830 --> 06:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
policy
 
06:18:03.350 --> 06:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
and this would be fortunate to have the
 
06:18:05.430 --> 06:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
enemy testify about the bill and
 
06:18:07.110 --> 06:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
all that in here again but you know it
 
06:18:07.120 --> 06:18:08.390 align:start position:0%
all that in here again but you know it
would

06:18:08.390 --> 06:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:18:10.310 --> 06:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
it could save us some time if it's a
 
06:18:12.708 --> 06:18:12.718 align:start position:0%
policy that we all would
 
06:18:15.670 --> 06:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
in this committee support
 
06:18:17.030 --> 06:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
refiling something that's right before
 
06:18:18.390 --> 06:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
us i'm just throwing up there i don't
 
06:18:21.350 --> 06:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
think i give you the same 122 is not
 
06:18:23.990 --> 06:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
nearly as complicated
 
06:18:26.230 --> 06:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
but you're but you're right that
 
06:18:28.628 --> 06:18:28.638 align:start position:0%
putting the unrelated bills together is
 
06:18:28.638 --> 06:18:29.590 align:start position:0%
putting the unrelated bills together is
a

06:18:29.590 --> 06:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:18:31.510 --> 06:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
practice that i understand some people
 
06:18:35.110 --> 06:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:36.788 --> 06:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
representative hopper
 
06:18:36.798 --> 06:18:43.990 align:start position:0%
representative hopper
yeah

06:18:43.990 --> 06:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:45.830 --> 06:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
one building was basically three
 
06:18:48.628 --> 06:18:48.638 align:start position:0%
separate bills all stacked together
 
06:18:48.638 --> 06:18:49.590 align:start position:0%
separate bills all stacked together
everybody

06:18:49.590 --> 06:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
06:18:52.628 --> 06:18:52.638 align:start position:0%
called in and talked about one section
 
06:18:54.390 --> 06:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
the other two sections which should be
 
06:18:57.030 --> 06:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
two separate bills
 
06:18:58.788 --> 06:18:58.798 align:start position:0%
if those were separate
 
06:19:01.270 --> 06:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
i think people only the public would
 
06:19:02.948 --> 06:19:02.958 align:start position:0%
have known about them
 
06:19:05.510 --> 06:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
and maybe chimed in on them or wanted to
 
06:19:07.510 --> 06:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
chime and knock on them
 
06:19:09.510 --> 06:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
but because they're pumped together
 
06:19:12.310 --> 06:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
you're denying the public access to
 
06:19:15.910 --> 06:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
speak on specific pieces of legislation
 
06:19:18.708 --> 06:19:18.718 align:start position:0%
so to me i'm not voting for anything
 
06:19:22.310 --> 06:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
in a clump that's because i think we're
 
06:19:24.628 --> 06:19:24.638 align:start position:0%
not doing the people's business the way
 
06:19:27.830 --> 06:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
it was intended but secondarily you know
 
06:19:30.868 --> 06:19:30.878 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to take out a section
 
06:19:33.910 --> 06:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
amended so there's only a section if i'm
 
06:19:35.670 --> 06:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
in favor of it i'll vote for that i'm
 
06:19:38.708 --> 06:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
not voting yes on these uh cumulative
 
06:19:44.548 --> 06:19:44.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:46.708 --> 06:19:46.718 align:start position:0%
over um
 
06:19:48.470 --> 06:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
if this continues
 
06:19:49.990 --> 06:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
eventually the
 
06:19:52.470 --> 06:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
criminal justice or the judiciary and
 
06:19:54.470 --> 06:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
the senate can just send us over 80
 
06:19:57.110 --> 06:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
bills in one stack and say hey go up or
 
06:19:57.120 --> 06:19:58.230 align:start position:0%
bills in one stack and say hey go up or
down

06:19:58.230 --> 06:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
down
 
06:20:00.868 --> 06:20:00.878 align:start position:0%
i think it's a bad precedent and we have
 
06:20:00.878 --> 06:20:01.590 align:start position:0%
i think it's a bad precedent and we have
a

06:20:01.590 --> 06:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:20:04.150 --> 06:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
complicated opportunity and obligation
 
06:20:06.070 --> 06:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
to start it
 
06:20:09.350 --> 06:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
yeah all right i i understand so
 
06:20:11.030 --> 06:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative you've heard some of the
 
06:20:11.040 --> 06:20:12.310 align:start position:0%
representative you've heard some of the
comments

06:20:12.310 --> 06:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
comments
 
06:20:14.470 --> 06:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
some people on the committee
 
06:20:16.788 --> 06:20:16.798 align:start position:0%
uh those comments aside if you you
 
06:20:18.390 --> 06:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
prepare an amendment
 
06:20:20.628 --> 06:20:20.638 align:start position:0%
but it is the desire of some members
 
06:20:22.788 --> 06:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
that you pick whatever part that you
 
06:20:24.310 --> 06:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
like the best
 
06:20:26.470 --> 06:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
if you you can always have more than one
 
06:20:29.510 --> 06:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
amendment prepared i believe versus
 
06:20:31.350 --> 06:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
that today we had more than one
 
06:20:33.030 --> 06:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
amendment so
 
06:20:34.948 --> 06:20:34.958 align:start position:0%
you can try your luck with two parts and
 
06:20:37.750 --> 06:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
see how that works
 
06:20:39.830 --> 06:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
very good
 
06:20:39.840 --> 06:20:40.548 align:start position:0%
very good
and

06:20:40.548 --> 06:20:40.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:20:43.350 --> 06:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it i'll leave it to you to uh
 
06:20:45.670 --> 06:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
have that prepared
 
06:20:47.510 --> 06:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
06:20:48.868 --> 06:20:48.878 align:start position:0%
what's that newman
 
06:20:51.270 --> 06:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i just didn't hear what i i believe
 
06:20:53.270 --> 06:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
i heard representative bordenay talk
 
06:20:54.948 --> 06:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
about an amendment and it had to do with
 
06:20:56.548 --> 06:20:56.558 align:start position:0%
the service animals and the increasing
 
06:20:57.910 --> 06:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
of the penalty
 
06:20:59.670 --> 06:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
was that correct that he was going to
 
06:21:01.750 --> 06:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
prepare amendment for that
 
06:21:07.670 --> 06:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:10.070 --> 06:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
i basically said that there are three
 
06:21:11.430 --> 06:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
new parts
 
06:21:14.548 --> 06:21:14.558 align:start position:0%
of uh in this in this um
 
06:21:14.558 --> 06:21:15.990 align:start position:0%
of uh in this in this um
122.

06:21:15.990 --> 06:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
122.
 
06:21:19.030 --> 06:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh two of them are non-controversial
 
06:21:19.040 --> 06:21:19.830 align:start position:0%
uh two of them are non-controversial
uh

06:21:19.830 --> 06:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:21:22.788 --> 06:21:22.798 align:start position:0%
the guardianship by great grandparents
 
06:21:27.830 --> 06:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
and the council for autism disorders
 
06:21:29.190 --> 06:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
those would be
 
06:21:31.190 --> 06:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
the amendments that amendment i would
 
06:21:34.788 --> 06:21:34.798 align:start position:0%
offer for the bill i would not bring in
 
06:21:34.798 --> 06:21:35.910 align:start position:0%
offer for the bill i would not bring in
the

06:21:35.910 --> 06:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:21:37.830 --> 06:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
increased penalty for harming a service
 
06:21:41.350 --> 06:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
job because we didn't really have a very
 
06:21:41.360 --> 06:21:43.270 align:start position:0%
job because we didn't really have a very
uh

06:21:43.270 --> 06:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:21:45.590 --> 06:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
good discussion on that particular part
 
06:21:47.190 --> 06:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
06:21:51.190 --> 06:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
and but also not uh include part one it
 
06:21:53.030 --> 06:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
has to do with
 
06:21:55.750 --> 06:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
driving on your influence and education
 
06:21:59.350 --> 06:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
because we did not hear any testimony on
 
06:22:03.190 --> 06:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:04.948 --> 06:22:04.958 align:start position:0%
is that clear yeah thank you for that
 
06:22:04.958 --> 06:22:06.390 align:start position:0%
is that clear yeah thank you for that
clarification

06:22:06.390 --> 06:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
06:22:06.400 --> 06:22:07.350 align:start position:0%
clarification
um

06:22:07.350 --> 06:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:09.990 --> 06:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
i i have a i have a problem with the
 
06:22:11.670 --> 06:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
increase of penalty it looks like two
 
06:22:13.350 --> 06:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
steps up to
 
06:22:16.070 --> 06:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
making felony for both and
 
06:22:18.948 --> 06:22:18.958 align:start position:0%
um i i love animals but felony
 
06:22:21.830 --> 06:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
convictions are a big deal
 
06:22:24.548 --> 06:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
i agree i think that that deserves to be
 
06:22:26.628 --> 06:22:26.638 align:start position:0%
a bill by itself
 
06:22:31.110 --> 06:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:33.190 --> 06:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
i didn't understand the chair
 
06:22:35.590 --> 06:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
you had hp 338 that i mean that if he
 
06:22:38.230 --> 06:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
was seen on the dog
 
06:22:38.240 --> 06:22:40.310 align:start position:0%
was seen on the dog
right

06:22:40.310 --> 06:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:22:40.320 --> 06:22:41.670 align:start position:0%
right
nice

06:22:41.670 --> 06:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
nice
 
06:22:44.310 --> 06:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
i'll look at that you guys all
 
06:22:45.590 --> 06:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
knocking down that day you wouldn't let
 
06:22:48.470 --> 06:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:50.470 --> 06:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
we can wrap up our representative
 
06:22:52.708 --> 06:22:52.718 align:start position:0%
with our question
 
06:22:56.310 --> 06:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair don't we have to vote those
 
06:22:58.788 --> 06:22:58.798 align:start position:0%
other bills down
 
06:23:01.270 --> 06:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
to accept that amendment
 
06:23:02.948 --> 06:23:02.958 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah they're just we're just we're
 
06:23:04.948 --> 06:23:04.958 align:start position:0%
kind of having another i don't know what
 
06:23:06.470 --> 06:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
you want to call it i was just
 
06:23:08.070 --> 06:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
suggesting that
 
06:23:09.350 --> 06:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
people want to
 
06:23:10.948 --> 06:23:10.958 align:start position:0%
prepare amendments but they would have
 
06:23:13.270 --> 06:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
to willingly adopt one just reminding
 
06:23:13.280 --> 06:23:16.628 align:start position:0%
to willingly adopt one just reminding
everyone

06:23:16.628 --> 06:23:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:18.708 --> 06:23:18.718 align:start position:0%
apple's ready but if if you have
 
06:23:21.190 --> 06:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
something about one paragraph or one
 
06:23:23.190 --> 06:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
sentence you want to change and you know
 
06:23:24.788 --> 06:23:24.798 align:start position:0%
something else is going forward
 
06:23:26.310 --> 06:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
you may want to
 
06:23:27.830 --> 06:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
work together and
 
06:23:29.110 --> 06:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
we're only going to adopt one so it
 
06:23:30.788 --> 06:23:30.798 align:start position:0%
would make sense
 
06:23:32.788 --> 06:23:32.798 align:start position:0%
if we have some time we're not meeting
 
06:23:46.230 --> 06:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:46.240 --> 06:23:48.548 align:start position:0%
 
otherwise

06:23:48.548 --> 06:23:48.558 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
06:23:48.558 --> 06:23:49.830 align:start position:0%
otherwise
i

06:23:49.830 --> 06:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:23:56.548 --> 06:23:56.558 align:start position:0%
