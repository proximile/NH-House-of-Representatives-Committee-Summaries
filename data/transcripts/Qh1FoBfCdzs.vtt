Governor's operating budget for the
 
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
and efficiently administer the tax laws
 
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire collecting
 
00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:55.139 align:start position:0%
the proper amount of taxes due while
 
00:07:57.529 --> 00:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
incurring the least cost to taxpayers in
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
a manner that merits the highest degree
 
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
of public confidence in our integrity
 
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
further we provide prompt and
 
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
constructive assistance to the municipal
 
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
units of government in matters of Budget
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
Finance and the appraisal of Real Estate
 
00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
together we developed a thoughtful
 
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
operating budget that will provide the
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
resource resources for our team to
 
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
administer the tax laws of the state for
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
another two fiscal years in a manner
 
00:08:20.809 --> 00:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
that is consistent with this mission
 
00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2022 the dra collected
 
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
2.7 billion dollars in state revenue
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
with total expenses of less than 18.7
 
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:32.820 align:start position:0%
million some of which is for activities
 
00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:34.979 align:start position:0%
unrelated to revenue collections such as
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
local assessment reviews and state aid
 
00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:39.659 align:start position:0%
when those unrelated costs are accounted
 
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
for our cost of collection is just over
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
one half of one percent
 
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
the information included with this
 
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
testimony explains how we were able to
 
00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
build a biennial budget that continues
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
to be an unparalleled return on state
 
00:08:55.009 --> 00:08:55.019 align:start position:0%
dollar tax investment and we look
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
forward to working with you
 
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
statement which I just read in my
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
opening remarks is on the second slide
 
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
organizational chart
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
so for the Department of Revenue
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
Administration fiscal year 22 and 23
 
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:27.959 align:start position:0%
organizational chart we have 156
 
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
authorized full-time positions there is
 
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
no change in the total number of
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
authorized positions for our 24 and 25
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
budget so we are not adding any
 
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
additional positions
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
those positions are broken down between
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
121 classified positions and 35
 
00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
and those positions fall in our
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
Administration unit audit division
 
00:09:55.009 --> 00:09:55.019 align:start position:0%
collections division taxpayer Services
 
00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
Division and Municipal and property
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
division I've included there the
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
accounting units that correspond to each
 
00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:03.899 align:start position:0%
division and as I said we'll kind of
 
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
walk through those
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
um unit by unit to discuss the
 
00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:12.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
moving on to slide four
 
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 2425 agency budget big
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
picture so you will see
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
um we have general fund education trust
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
fund and agency income the majority of
 
00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
our budget is general fund dollars
 
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund money is to for
 
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
the Department to administer the low and
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
moderate property tax relief program so
 
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
those payments come out of the education
 
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
trust fund and then the agency income is
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
flood control which we will get to in a
 
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
then you have a total for all funds and
 
00:10:56.449 --> 00:10:56.459 align:start position:0%
we're showing fiscal year 22 23 adjusted
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
authorized and then for 24 and 25 I've
 
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
included the agency request and then
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
what the governor has proposed
 
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
you will see when you're comparing total
 
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
funds from fiscal year 22 to fiscal year
 
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:13.220 align:start position:0%
23. the total funds of 18 just under
 
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
18.7 million of actual expense in 22 and
 
00:11:19.329 --> 00:11:19.339 align:start position:0%
in 23
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
22.1 million the biggest difference
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
there is really due to our vacancy rate
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
our general fund operating budget is
 
00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:31.019 align:start position:0%
about 75 salary and benefits so we are a
 
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
department of people not things or
 
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
programs we've been operating at about a
 
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
15 vacancy rate
 
00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
um for probably close to the last 18
 
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
months so that's really the biggest
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
difference between our 22 actual and our
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:53.569 --> 00:11:53.579 align:start position:0%
um you will see as I mentioned on the
 
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
previous slide that our total number of
 
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
positions remains static at 156
 
00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.590 align:start position:0%
positions remains static at 156
positions

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
um the funded position count has
 
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.630 align:start position:0%
um the funded position count has
decreased

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
decreased
 
00:12:08.569 --> 00:12:08.579 align:start position:0%
um from 156 full-time classified and
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions in fiscal 21 to
 
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
150 in fiscal years 22 and 23 we did
 
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
request for those additional six
 
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
positions to be funded in 24 and 25
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
however the governor did not fund them
 
00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
so we um the governor's budget remains
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
static at a funding 150 of our 156.
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
the budget generally includes sufficient
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
funding McGuire's sure you're going to
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
highlight those extra positions as we go
 
00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:44.339 align:start position:0%
along I will that's right thank you
 
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:45.660 align:start position:0%
um the budget generally sufficiently
 
00:12:47.569 --> 00:12:47.579 align:start position:0%
funds provides funding for employee
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
training out of state travel for our
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
audits overtime for Peak periods and
 
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:53.700 align:start position:0%
taxpayer services and collections
 
00:12:56.329 --> 00:12:56.339 align:start position:0%
division maintenance of state-owned cars
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
for our in-state Audits and property
 
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
appraisal work and postage for Dra
 
00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
Communications to taxpayers I will go
 
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
through accounting unit by accounting
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
unit and highlight areas but of
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
difference between the agency's request
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
and the governor's amounts and any
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
additional requests that we have
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
so going to page five we will start with
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
the administration accounting unit which
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
the most significant differences between
 
00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
our fiscal year 23 adjusted authorized
 
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
and the fiscal 24 and 25 amounts from
 
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:41.220 align:start position:0%
the governor occur in a few different
 
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.530 align:start position:0%
the governor occur in a few different
places

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
first in class 27 the transfers to doit
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
the increase here is due to a request
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
for funding for rims consultant so when
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
we came in previously to do our meet and
 
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
greet we talked about our Revenue
 
00:13:59.690 --> 00:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
information management system it was a
 
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
30 million one hundred and sixty dollar
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar Capital appropriation
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
that Capital appropriation includes
 
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
Hardware maintenance and software
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
licensing through fiscal 25. but only
 
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
include software maintenance and
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
Consulting through the first quarter of
 
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.410 align:start position:0%
Consulting through the first quarter of
2024.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
2024.
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
so the increases due to funding of six
 
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
consultants for the remainder of fiscal
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
24 and then five consultants for fiscal
 
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.030 align:start position:0%
24 and then five consultants for fiscal
25.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
25.
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
the reason why those amounts are not
 
00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:32.700 align:start position:0%
included in the capital budget is
 
00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:35.060 align:start position:0%
because we opted to not select
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
predetermined support for our post
 
00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:40.740 align:start position:0%
implementation Consulting needs because
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
we didn't know what we would need and we
 
00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959 align:start position:0%
wanted to have the flexibility that a
 
00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
time and materials
 
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
budget would allow us both in terms of
 
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:52.740 align:start position:0%
making sure we're only receiving exactly
 
00:14:55.009 --> 00:14:55.019 align:start position:0%
what we need and to provide some cost
 
00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness so at the time that we
 
00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
went out to bid with this Capital
 
00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.710 align:start position:0%
went out to bid with this Capital
appropriation

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
we didn't know what we were going to
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
need and I didn't want to lock us into
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
either a amount of amount of Consulting
 
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
that was in excess of what we would need
 
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:10.940 align:start position:0%
and therefore could be a waste of money
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
or lock us into an amount of Consulting
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
that was not sufficient so now that
 
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
we've gone through the implementation of
 
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
rims and rims is active we feel
 
00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:21.769 align:start position:0%
rims and rims is active we feel
comfortable

00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:21.779 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
with requesting the amount for six
 
00:15:26.569 --> 00:15:26.579 align:start position:0%
Consultants as I mentioned in 24 and
 
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:30.260 align:start position:0%
five consultants in 25.
 
00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire has a further
 
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you so it looks like
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
this line has an extra two million
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
dollars in it
 
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
um that's a lot for six Consultants
 
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
isn't it like four hundred thousand
 
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
dollars each or something that's right
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
um it is
 
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
it your math is right is it roughly four
 
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars a year but it
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
is a time in materials contract so we
 
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily be locked into that
 
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
amount that is the amount that we've
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
budgeted for each consultant arriving at
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
six but if we decide that we need less
 
00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
than that then the time of materials
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
budget would give us the flexibility
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
so what I'm hoping to get to ultimately
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
is less Reliance on the Consultants I
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
want to shift that work to doit that's
 
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
um and we're not totally ready to do
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
that just yet so I want to make sure
 
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
that we have a smooth transition rims
 
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
has been very successful as we've
 
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned up until this point
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
um it's been successful for the
 
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
department and for the taxpayers and so
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
I would like to get to a point where we
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
are maybe only looking at four
 
00:16:43.129 --> 00:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
Consultants on site at times but we're
 
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
just not there yet so that's why you'll
 
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
see the request goes from six to five
 
00:16:50.569 --> 00:16:50.579 align:start position:0%
because I do want to Trail down because
 
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
they are expensive
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
um but it is an important system it
 
00:16:56.689 --> 00:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
brings in the vast majority of our
 
00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
general and education trust fund Revenue
 
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
so it's just making sure that we find
 
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
that balance
 
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
man sure is the software proprietary in
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
some ways and such that the doit people
 
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
will never be able to
 
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
maintain it or something or not really
 
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
I it is proprietary but not to the sense
 
00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:18.299 align:start position:0%
that they will never be able to maintain
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
it we've already started a nice
 
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
partnership where our folks work in
 
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the vendor Consultants
 
00:17:27.169 --> 00:17:27.179 align:start position:0%
um there just needs to be some more
 
00:17:30.169 --> 00:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
knowledge transfer there thank you I
 
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
have a question commissioner 30 million
 
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
dollars as far as the rims Consultants
 
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly large number when you said
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
you went out to bid how many people bid
 
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
on this contract we received two bids
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
um they're the two main players in this
 
00:17:48.409 --> 00:17:48.419 align:start position:0%
field the bids in terms of dollars were
 
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
looks like you may have a question no
 
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
not yet okay
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and just to clarify if I made the
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
30 million dollars includes the
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
Consulting work but also the license for
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
the software and the hardware we have a
 
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
significant amount of Hardware that's
 
00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
associated with it as well so the 30
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
the other place that you'll see
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
um an increase or a difference between
 
00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:22.940 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23 and the 24 and 25 Governors
 
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
Amounts is in our equipment and in-state
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
travel and that increase is for the
 
00:18:30.169 --> 00:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
purchase of new state cars and
 
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
maintenance of existing state cars
 
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
for in-state travel for our Municipal
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
and property division audit and
 
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
collections activities our current Fleet
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
of State cars is aging
 
00:18:45.169 --> 00:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
um some of our vehicles
 
00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:48.299 align:start position:0%
um are older than 2014. so we're
 
00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
starting to see them come to the end of
 
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
their life and not be as reliable so the
 
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
equipment money is to start to replace
 
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
some of those cars in the in-state
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
travel money is for the maintenance of
 
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see an increase in employee
 
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:05.940 align:start position:0%
training and out-of-state travel and
 
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
that is for additional staff to attend
 
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
Federation of tax administrators
 
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.010 align:start position:0%
Federation of tax administrators
conferences

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:11.020 align:start position:0%
conferences
 
00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.470 align:start position:0%
conferences
[Music]

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
um well maybe that doesn't sound like
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
the most exciting conference
 
00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:18.419 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you that they are very
 
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
beneficial they provide great training
 
00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:22.460 align:start position:0%
opportunities for our staff
 
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
and so we would like to continue to
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
moving on to page six in terms of
 
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:32.700 align:start position:0%
additional requests and I guess these
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
are really just differences between what
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
the agency requested and what the
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
governor funded
 
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
in class 27 transfers to doit we had
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
requested funding for two positions that
 
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
are currently unfunded and they remain
 
00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:48.419 align:start position:0%
unfunded in the governor's budget and
 
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
those are in order to prepare for the
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
fact that 40 to 60 percent of our doit
 
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
embedded positions at dra are eligible
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
for retirement in the next biennium
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
so I would like to get those positions
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
funded so that I can bring new employees
 
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
in and start the knowledge transfer
 
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
process that will also help us
 
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
um set the groundwork for taking on more
 
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
and more of that responsibility for the
 
00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the rims system so in 24
 
00:20:18.409 --> 00:20:18.419 align:start position:0%
the salary and benefits for those two
 
00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
positions is a hundred and forty one
 
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
thousand six hundred and twenty seven
 
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
dollars and in 25 those two positions
 
00:20:27.549 --> 00:20:27.559 align:start position:0%
salary and benefits is 148
 
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
also a difference between what the
 
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
agency requested and the governor funded
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
we had requested
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
um additional rims Consultants we had
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
actually asked for eight
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
um Consultants the governor funded six
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
in 24 and 5 in 25. we are currently at
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
10 so this will start to Trail us off
 
00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
and get us to a place where our Reliance
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
on the Consultants is less and that we
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
take on more of the work internally as
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
we were just discussing I'd like to see
 
00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
that be a fairly smooth transition so if
 
00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
we were to fund the eight that we had
 
00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
originally requested it would be an
 
00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
additional 864 024 and 1.3 million in
 
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.289 align:start position:0%
additional 864 024 and 1.3 million in
25.

00:21:18.289 --> 00:21:18.299 align:start position:0%
25.
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
lastly just the last change between the
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
agency's request and the governor's
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
funding is in the equipment line again
 
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
to replace some of our aging State cars
 
00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:30.539 align:start position:0%
we asked for would ask for an additional
 
00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
150 000 each year the cars are running
 
00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:36.299 align:start position:0%
somewhere between Thirty and forty
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a piece and so as our
 
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:40.980 align:start position:0%
Fleet ages we will start to need to
 
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
replace those
 
00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
can we just back up to 27 again yeah
 
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
that uh 864
 
00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
000 is for how many additional that
 
00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
would be two additional
 
00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
again on a time and materials basis so
 
00:22:03.169 --> 00:22:03.179 align:start position:0%
if I were to contract for those two
 
00:22:06.529 --> 00:22:06.539 align:start position:0%
that's what I would pay but we have an
 
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
existing time in materials contract and
 
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
I intend to continue with the time in
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
materials contract so that if I don't
 
00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
use the services or don't feel the need
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
for them I'm not going to pay for them
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
so it would just be for the work
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
performed I guess I'm just having it
 
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
very difficult time getting my head
 
00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
around two individuals
 
00:22:30.289 --> 00:22:30.299 align:start position:0%
Consultants 864 thousand dollars
 
00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
they're expensive and I will tell you
 
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
that these are even based on hourly
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
rates that we locked in in our original
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
contract back in 2018. So if I were to
 
00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:45.059 align:start position:0%
go back out and request current rates
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
they would be even higher so I know that
 
00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:51.179 align:start position:0%
it's expensive I am very much aware of
 
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
it I do want to transition to doit
 
00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.110 align:start position:0%
it I do want to transition to doit
supporting

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
um this application it's just not
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
something that can really happen
 
00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
overnight so again trying to make that
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
smooth effective transition
 
00:23:07.559 --> 00:23:08.330 align:start position:0%
smooth effective transition
um

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
we will be sufficient with what the
 
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
governor has funded with six and five I
 
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
just wanted to be transparent if you
 
00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
were to look at the difference between
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
what the agency requested and what the
 
00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
governor funded and that's the
 
00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
difference representative McGuire thank
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so with the the first
 
00:23:27.289 --> 00:23:27.299 align:start position:0%
item the the two new
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
um doit people
 
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
are they working in that same area so
 
00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
they would so having them would would
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
let us use fewer Consultants faster
 
00:23:39.649 --> 00:23:39.659 align:start position:0%
maybe correct because could we take over
 
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
kind of correct that is part of the plan
 
00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:43.799 align:start position:0%
so get these two new people on board
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
have them learn from the existing doit
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
employees and learn from the fast
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
Consultants one thing that I will
 
00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
mention is we talked about this during
 
00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:58.140 align:start position:0%
the meet and greet the don t employees
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
that are with us at dra started on a
 
00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:03.419 align:start position:0%
Cobalt system they were working on an
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
aging Cobalt system four years ago they
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
have now transferred
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
um to
 
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
the new Rim system which I'm not a very
 
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:15.419 align:start position:0%
technical person but I understand that
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
it uses the vb.net language so they've
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
you know transferred from Cobalt to
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
vb.net we have received um arpa funds to
 
00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
upgrade the rim software to use c-sharp
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
language which I understand is much more
 
00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
popular with the folks coming out of
 
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
school and entering the workforce these
 
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
days so my goal would get would be for
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
these two positions that you reference
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
to hire those people that are interested
 
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
in c-sharp in order to help that
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
transition so the upgrade to the rim
 
00:24:51.649 --> 00:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
system with the arpa funds to move to
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
c-sharp is part of the big master plan
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
of getting us to a point where we can
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
any further questions at this point
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
yes representative evil followed by
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
camera so what are the materials exactly
 
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
in these times and time and materials I
 
00:25:15.409 --> 00:25:15.419 align:start position:0%
use that term loosely it would probably
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
be any Associated travel
 
00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:21.419 align:start position:0%
um if
 
00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
in a more
 
00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
um in a different time and materials
 
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
contract if I was paying Consultants the
 
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
materials be the travel costs to come
 
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
and visit the dra and do the work here
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
fortunately in these cases as I
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously all of these
 
00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:36.779 align:start position:0%
Consultants move here
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
um so the materials are relatively small
 
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
it's basically just the cost of of the
 
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
hourly rate of the employee that we
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
would be using
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
so are you Contracting for like a year
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
of service or when you consult with them
 
00:25:54.169 --> 00:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
you sort of if you need them for a week
 
00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
they come in and then they go away or
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
how does that for the most part up until
 
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
this point they have we have what we
 
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
call fasties on site at all times
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
because our needs have been fairly
 
00:26:09.289 --> 00:26:09.299 align:start position:0%
significant because we're you know just
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
within the first year or so post
 
00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.789 align:start position:0%
within the first year or so post
implementation

00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
00:26:13.799 --> 00:26:14.450 align:start position:0%
implementation
um

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
so we haven't had kind of the need for a
 
00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
one-off person for a week or something
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
like that it has typically been you know
 
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
generally needing the resource for a
 
00:26:27.649 --> 00:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
prescribed period of time
 
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
but we make sure in that contract we
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
have the flexibility to say okay we
 
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
don't need six resources anymore we're
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
ready to go to five and we just need to
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
provide them with enough notice of that
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
change are they employees of the company
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
that you okay they are yes
 
00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.390 align:start position:0%
that you okay they are yes
representative

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.470 align:start position:0%
representative
foreign

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.330 align:start position:0%
foreign
okay

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
we can move on to page seven if we're
 
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.610 align:start position:0%
we can move on to page seven if we're
ready

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
ready
 
00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
and so I'm just going in the order here
 
00:27:00.649 --> 00:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
um of the accounting units as you see
 
00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
them in the governor's recommended
 
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
budget so on page 153 you will see
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
workers compensation
 
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
um you will see a difference between the
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2022 and fiscal 23 adjusted
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
authorized and then what the governor is
 
00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
funding for 24 and 25 because we have
 
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
had some workers compensation expenses
 
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
um in 22 that were not budget budgeted
 
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
for previously
 
00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:28.140 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation remains flat
 
00:27:30.409 --> 00:27:30.419 align:start position:0%
over the the two years and that's on
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
page 154.
 
00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
moving to page 155 taxpayer services so
 
00:27:39.169 --> 00:27:39.179 align:start position:0%
this is our largest apartment largest
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
division within the department this
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
these are the folks that staff our call
 
00:27:45.649 --> 00:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
center process all of the mail process
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
all of the money perform all of their
 
00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:49.820 align:start position:0%
routine account maintenance
 
00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
there is an increase
 
00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
in class 20 current expenses between 23
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
to 24 and 25 and that's due to an
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
increase in our number of mailings and
 
00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
then the increase that we've seen in
 
00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.070 align:start position:0%
then the increase that we've seen in
postage

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
postage
 
00:28:06.649 --> 00:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
and then there is an increase in fiscal
 
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
24 in the equipment line for the
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
purchase of a new mail opening machine
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
we do not open our mail by hand we have
 
00:28:16.669 --> 00:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
a machine that assists us with that and
 
00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
it is aging out and needs to be replaced
 
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
so that's the change that you'll see in
 
00:28:24.649 --> 00:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 for equipment
 
00:28:24.659 --> 00:28:25.730 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 for equipment
under

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:25.740 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
um sir McGuire thank you so I'm
 
00:28:30.769 --> 00:28:30.779 align:start position:0%
surprised I guess that the number of
 
00:28:33.049 --> 00:28:33.059 align:start position:0%
employees in this area is not declining
 
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:34.740 align:start position:0%
because I would assume that there's a
 
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:37.140 align:start position:0%
lot more online stuff compared to mail
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
and therefore you wouldn't need as many
 
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.269 align:start position:0%
and therefore you wouldn't need as many
people

00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
um are some unfunded positions in here
 
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
which we are not asking to refund
 
00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
um refund that's not asking to fund
 
00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:54.049 --> 00:28:54.059 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
um what we have seen
 
00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
and we anticipated this when we
 
00:29:00.529 --> 00:29:00.539 align:start position:0%
implemented our our Rim system and as we
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
started to see
 
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
um filings move to electronic and away
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
from paper we still get a fair amount of
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
paper but we created
 
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
um different we modified our job
 
00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:12.539 align:start position:0%
classification and created a
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
classification series that allows
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
employees to have a nice career path
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
within the division but also accounted
 
00:29:21.889 --> 00:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
for the fact that yes you're not going
 
00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:24.539 align:start position:0%
to open mail and key information as much
 
00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:26.940 align:start position:0%
as you did five or ten years ago and so
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
we modified the job descriptions so that
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
those employees now perform additional
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
functions within the rim system because
 
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
that's the way that the direction that
 
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
our our taxpayers are moving
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
yeah but the overall total needed
 
00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
is not really changing or is or is this
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
area pulling in functions from some
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
other areas that they are taking on
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
additional functions and under the class
 
00:29:54.289 --> 00:29:54.299 align:start position:0%
103 additional requests or differences
 
00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
between the governor's budget and what
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
the agency requested we historically
 
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
relied very heavily on temporary
 
00:30:03.649 --> 00:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
services during our Peak filing periods
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
so we would have temporary employees
 
00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
come in help open the mail and key their
 
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
returns and our own employees would do
 
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
some of the more Advanced Maintenance
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
work we now rely a lot less on the
 
00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
temporary employees because we're not
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
having that influx of paper
 
00:30:21.409 --> 00:30:21.419 align:start position:0%
so there was twenty thousand dollars
 
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
that was requested in each year by the
 
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
agency that was not funded by the
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:33.059 align:start position:0%
moving on to page nine with the audit
 
00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
um the really only significant change
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
between 23 and 24 and 25 for this
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
accounting unit is out of state travel
 
00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
as we increase or get back to normal
 
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
with our on-site audits obviously this
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
is an area that decreased significantly
 
00:30:59.810 --> 00:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic as many businesses
 
00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:03.620 align:start position:0%
closed people couldn't travel we are now
 
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
reinstating a lot of those in-person
 
00:31:09.049 --> 00:31:09.059 align:start position:0%
audits so that's the difference there
 
00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
um this is an area where we had funded
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
two multi-state tax Auditors in our
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
agency budget the governor did not fund
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
those positions
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
um these are Revenue producing positions
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
they would each produce about one and a
 
00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:28.860 align:start position:0%
half million dollars of Revenue over the
 
00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
biennium so three million in total and I
 
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
have you know detailed the salary
 
00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:37.799 align:start position:0%
benefits employee training and out of
 
00:31:39.289 --> 00:31:39.299 align:start position:0%
state travel costs that would be
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
Associated if those positions were to be
 
00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.549 align:start position:0%
Associated if those positions were to be
funded

00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:43.559 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
didn't we fund a couple of positions two
 
00:31:48.889 --> 00:31:48.899 align:start position:0%
years ago for out of state
 
00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
you did additional positions were
 
00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
created we actually added positions and
 
00:31:58.010 --> 00:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
then they ended up being unfunded so
 
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
those two new positions from two budgets
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
ago have actually never been funded they
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
were created and then immediately
 
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.070 align:start position:0%
were created and then immediately
unfunded

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:09.059 align:start position:0%
I thought we funded them with the Senate
 
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
take them out I believe so
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
so there are two positions
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
um that have that are unfunded
 
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
um and so this would be the cost if we
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire so does this mean if
 
00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
we have these two positions we can add
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
three million to what ways of means told
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
us that is how we've done it in the past
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
yep when once they're funded it will go
 
00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:34.740 align:start position:0%
on the Surplus statement as an
 
00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:35.690 align:start position:0%
on the Surplus statement as an
additional

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
um three million typically in the second
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
year of the biennium because it takes
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
the learning curve
 
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
so how many employees are in this area
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
and and is this do they actually show
 
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
1.5 million each so at least at least so
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
we currently have one two three four
 
00:32:52.679 --> 00:32:53.990 align:start position:0%
we currently have one two three four
five

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:32:57.769 --> 00:32:57.779 align:start position:0%
nine positions in that unit we have
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
three vacancies plus the two unfunded
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
um they are vacant at the moment because
 
00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:04.919 align:start position:0%
this is a very difficult time of year
 
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
for us to hire for those positions as we
 
00:33:09.049 --> 00:33:09.059 align:start position:0%
get into tax season
 
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
um we'd like to be a little bit
 
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
strategic and post these positions for
 
00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.570 align:start position:0%
strategic and post these positions for
higher

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
higher
 
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
um shortly after April 15th hoping to
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
potentially entice those folks that have
 
00:33:21.529 --> 00:33:21.539 align:start position:0%
had a rough tax filing system and
 
00:33:24.409 --> 00:33:24.419 align:start position:0%
Private Industry to come and join us
 
00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:25.640 align:start position:0%
um in state government
 
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.230 align:start position:0%
um in state government
so

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
we will be actively recruiting for those
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
once we get through our busy season so
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
you think in the summer you may that's
 
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
any further questions at this point
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
pay attention
 
00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:46.380 align:start position:0%
on page 10 we have the collections
 
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
division which corresponds to page 157
 
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
of the governor's recommended budget
 
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
changes here you'll see a change in the
 
00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
overtime line and that is an increase
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
due to Peak periods of collection
 
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
activity where work occurs outside of
 
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:05.100 align:start position:0%
normal work hours the primary driver of
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
this is fair season in the fall we have
 
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
uh folks of in our collections division
 
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
go out to the fairs meet with the m r
 
00:34:16.129 --> 00:34:16.139 align:start position:0%
operators who are there make sure that
 
00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
they are licensed collect any
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
outstanding amounts that may be due in
 
00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
that time obviously those fares tend to
 
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
occur on the weekends so we request
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
um land acquisition and easement the
 
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
change there is due to fees for online
 
00:34:36.649 --> 00:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
lean recording services this has been a
 
00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:39.419 align:start position:0%
great benefit to us in order to be able
 
00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:41.339 align:start position:0%
to file these liens electronically so
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
there's just the difference in the fee
 
00:34:44.089 --> 00:34:44.099 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
and then employee training increase due
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
to newer staff needing additional
 
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
collections training so we have been
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
very successful with recruiting within
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
our Collection Division and so we have
 
00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
some new employees that have come on as
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
a result of some retirements and so we'd
 
00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:02.339 align:start position:0%
like to provide them with the necessary
 
00:35:02.339 --> 00:35:04.190 align:start position:0%
like to provide them with the necessary
training

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:06.599 align:start position:0%
to follow up representative McGuire on
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
your question from our meet and greet
 
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
you had asked about how much of our
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
Revenue goes into collections and the
 
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
additional collection or Advanced
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement activity so less than three
 
00:35:20.089 --> 00:35:20.099 align:start position:0%
percent of all revenue is transferred to
 
00:35:23.329 --> 00:35:23.339 align:start position:0%
collections for enforcement and then of
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
that less than half approximately 45
 
00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.109 align:start position:0%
that less than half approximately 45
percent

00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
um we will place liens or take some sort
 
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
of advanced activity
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
the some of the most busy time for our
 
00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
collections division is actually coming
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
up in the next few months
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
um m r taxpayers our meals and rentals
 
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.569 align:start position:0%
um m r taxpayers our meals and rentals
operators

00:35:43.569 --> 00:35:43.579 align:start position:0%
operators
 
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
their licenses automatically renew in
 
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
odd years so we are coming up on a
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
license renewal in order to be
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
automatically renewed they have to be in
 
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.569 align:start position:0%
automatically renewed they have to be in
compliance

00:35:56.569 --> 00:35:56.579 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
00:35:59.690 --> 00:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
so right now what we're doing is looking
 
00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
at those m r operators who are due to be
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
renewed in June and looking at those
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
that have outstanding balances and
 
00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
that's approximately 15 of our m r
 
00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:12.300 align:start position:0%
operators so what we will do now is work
 
00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
with them between now and June 30 to
 
00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
come into compliance so that they can
 
00:36:19.849 --> 00:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
get their automatic renewal
 
00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
um and we'll do that through going out
 
00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
in the field like literally visiting
 
00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
their businesses bringing them in for
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
pre-hearing conferences making sure
 
00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
everything is
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
um is ready to go for June 30 of those
 
00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
less than one percent actually result in
 
00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:37.079 align:start position:0%
US proceeding with a hearing in order to
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
revoke their license because they're not
 
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney please thank you
 
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and taking our
 
00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
questions on the the overtime Seasons
 
00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
with the fairs yeah is it one m r
 
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
operator per fair or do you have to go
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
to Every truck we spend a lot of time
 
00:36:58.490 --> 00:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
going to each and every truck we get
 
00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
lists of the the trucks and the vendors
 
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:03.780 align:start position:0%
from the fair organizers so we know
 
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
who's there we know whether or not
 
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:07.740 align:start position:0%
they're licensed in advance so if we
 
00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
have an operator that we don't believe
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
is licensed we'll know and we will
 
00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
um go and meet with them and have all
 
00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:14.940 align:start position:0%
the paperwork ready so that we can get
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
them licensed hopefully on the spot
 
00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:18.230 align:start position:0%
them licensed hopefully on the spot
um

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
so we kind of go with a plan but we will
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
go and visit all of the fried dough all
 
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:25.740 align:start position:0%
of the bloom and onions
 
00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
um lemonade lemonade stands yes thank
 
00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
you yep
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
and here I thought taco trucks were
 
00:37:38.569 --> 00:37:38.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
we like to make sure that they're all
 
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
licensed so they're all on an equal
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
playing field
 
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
um and so that no one vendor is
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
benefiting from a lower price because
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
they're not collecting and remitting the
 
00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.069 align:start position:0%
they're not collecting and remitting the
tax

00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:55.079 align:start position:0%
any other questions on collections
 
00:37:55.079 --> 00:37:56.870 align:start position:0%
any other questions on collections
okay

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
page 11 our Municipal and property
 
00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.810 align:start position:0%
page 11 our Municipal and property
division

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
um just really two changes there one is
 
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
in class 38 technology software we have
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
a technology software maintenance
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
maintenance contract for our tax rate
 
00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
setting portal and Equalization
 
00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
application and so the change from 23 to
 
00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:20.700 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 is just a change in the in the
 
00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
contract price for that
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
and then class 66 and class 70 and 80
 
00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:29.099 align:start position:0%
employee training and then in-state and
 
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
out of state travel and this is just a
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
change due to again wanting to resume
 
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
attendance at conferences and trainings
 
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
for our employees to benefit from that
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
this is the other position that is
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
currently unfunded that I wanted to
 
00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
mention so we had requested funding for
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
a municipal accounts auditor the
 
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
position is currently unfunded and it
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
remains unfunded in the governor's
 
00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
budget I've included the salary and
 
00:38:58.609 --> 00:38:58.619 align:start position:0%
benefits if the position were to be
 
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
funded we similar to the conversation we
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
were having about our doit embedded
 
00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
staff we have a lot of folks in this
 
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
division that are approaching retirement
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
um and we would like to fund this
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
position so that we can fill it and
 
00:39:16.849 --> 00:39:16.859 align:start position:0%
conduct some knowledge transfer in
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
advance of the pending retirements
 
00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you are
 
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
there vacant auditor positions there are
 
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
not they are all filled at this time
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
so as a follow-up to representative
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
McGuire's question uh funded but vacant
 
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
positions did you tell us how many you
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
funded but vacant we have 26 we have 16
 
00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
and the nice thing about the nice thing
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
about that Municipal accounts auditor
 
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
position that we're requesting funding
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
is those positions actually live within
 
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
two different bureaus
 
00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
um in the municipal Bureau that focuses
 
00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
on assisting the municipalities with
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
budgeting and finance and setting up the
 
00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
tax rates and then also within our
 
00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
Equalization Bureau which equalizes
 
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
every year all of the properties within
 
00:40:22.849 --> 00:40:22.859 align:start position:0%
the state so that auto that position
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
lives within both of those bureaus and
 
00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
so by filling it we would be able to
 
00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
oh with all those funded but vacant
 
00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
positions how can we make it work that
 
00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
you could get some of those positions
 
00:40:43.849 --> 00:40:43.859 align:start position:0%
like the out-of-state Auditors and
 
00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
and roll that in because obviously
 
00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
you're functioning fairly well from at
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
least that's what would appear so how
 
00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
can we make it work with all the funding
 
00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
you're getting for those unfunded
 
00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:54.890 align:start position:0%
you're getting for those unfunded
positions

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.290 align:start position:0%
positions
so

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:56.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:59.450 --> 00:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
alternatively what we can do is proceed
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
with reclassifying the the positions
 
00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
that are vacant
 
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
um that process has been on hold until
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
recently as the division of personnel
 
00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:11.940 align:start position:0%
um moves through the reclassification
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
design process and we transfer to a new
 
00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
classification system that's been in the
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
work for works for a number of years it
 
00:41:23.329 --> 00:41:23.339 align:start position:0%
seems like we're in the final stages but
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
the reclassifications have kind of been
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
on on pause while we transition to this
 
00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
new system so once the the
 
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
um we're able to efficiently reclassify
 
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
positions we can effectively do that
 
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
take some of our vacancies and create
 
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
them it's just a lengthy process to do
 
00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:42.829 align:start position:0%
them it's just a lengthy process to do
so

00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
I've heard this problem before but I'll
 
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
let representative cambrell's speak to
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
this question perhaps go ahead well
 
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair kind of to follow up
 
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
on what you're saying um I noticed that
 
00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
so you have 26 vacancies but yet I found
 
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
very little overtime throughout
 
00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
throughout the Departments so is it an
 
00:42:04.609 --> 00:42:04.619 align:start position:0%
assumption that some other people are
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
doing some of the work that for the
 
00:42:08.569 --> 00:42:08.579 align:start position:0%
other and you're not having to do the
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
overtime correct correct we we try to
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
um really limit overtime to when we know
 
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to need it like Fair season
 
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
for collections or within our taxpayer
 
00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
services division during Peak filing
 
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
season like March and April otherwise we
 
00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:26.180 align:start position:0%
encourage employees
 
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
to accumulate comp time we allow them to
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
accumulate up to a week at a time and
 
00:42:35.569 --> 00:42:35.579 align:start position:0%
then utilize that comp time in order to
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
kind of prevent I'm trying to prevent
 
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
burnout type situations and also be
 
00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
mindful of our budget over time can get
 
00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.670 align:start position:0%
mindful of our budget over time can get
expensive

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
um so trying to utilize both in a
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
balanced way
 
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
I know you may not be the one to answer
 
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
this question but why is it taking so
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
long for the reclassification
 
00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:56.569 align:start position:0%
long for the reclassification
um

00:42:56.569 --> 00:42:56.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:59.569 --> 00:42:59.579 align:start position:0%
I will just say generally it is very
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
complicated we have you know hundreds of
 
00:43:03.119 --> 00:43:03.970 align:start position:0%
complicated we have you know hundreds of
classifications

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:03.980 align:start position:0%
classifications
 
00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.030 align:start position:0%
classifications
[Music]

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
um within the state at the moment and
 
00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to I think rightfully so
 
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
move to
 
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
a more defined classification system
 
00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
that's actually used by the federal
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
government and kind of managed by the
 
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
um and but it literally takes looking at
 
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
every employee and moving them into the
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
new classification in the new system is
 
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
that committee and part of Das yes
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
that's been headed by the division of
 
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
personnel at Das
 
00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:42.170 align:start position:0%
personnel at Das
um

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
like I said I do believe we're in kind
 
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
of the final stages of getting that off
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
the ground I think the hope is by July
 
00:43:49.319 --> 00:43:50.630 align:start position:0%
the ground I think the hope is by July
1.

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
1.
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
um all agency heads are part of a
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholder group at this point where we
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
meet once a month to make sure that
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
everything is moving and the impacts to
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
our agency are exactly what we
 
00:44:00.839 --> 00:44:02.150 align:start position:0%
our agency are exactly what we
anticipate

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
um so it is moving along I think it's
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
just the complexity of ten thousand
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
state employees and hundreds of
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
classifications I guess which is here
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
said that scared me was that we're
 
00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
trying to model this after the federal
 
00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
program I think it's it's more
 
00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:21.650 align:start position:0%
program I think it's it's more
um

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
it's a and then unfortunately I
 
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
apologize the name is escaping me um but
 
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
Lori rudis uh the director of the
 
00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
division of personnel it's a
 
00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
classification system I would say it's
 
00:44:35.569 --> 00:44:35.579 align:start position:0%
not the federal classification system
 
00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
but it's a classification system that's
 
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
kind of maintained
 
00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
um at the federal level so that we don't
 
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
have to the state doesn't have to do as
 
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
much ongoing maintenance of our
 
00:44:50.089 --> 00:44:50.099 align:start position:0%
classifications in the future it's a a
 
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
more common classification system is
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
probably a better way of saying it as
 
00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
opposed to the classification system
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:44:58.730 --> 00:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
um exists solely within the state of New
 
00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:00.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're trying to move to a more
 
00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
common classification system
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
um that therefore doesn't require as
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.710 align:start position:0%
 
together

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.190 align:start position:0%
together
okay

00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:18.300 align:start position:0%
everyone's favorite page 12 flood
 
00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:22.910 align:start position:0%
everyone's favorite page 12 flood
control

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
so the fiscal year 24 and 25 budget so
 
00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I'll back up for a second
 
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
um this is a split between agency income
 
00:45:34.609 --> 00:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
and general fund income the agency
 
00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
income is the amount of money that we
 
00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:41.060 align:start position:0%
the dra slash the state of New Hampshire
 
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
receives from
 
00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
um the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and
 
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
the state of Connecticut for their share
 
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
of the Merrimack River Valley Compact
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
and the Connecticut River Valley compact
 
00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
the general fund money is the state of
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's portion so again the
 
00:46:01.089 --> 00:46:01.099 align:start position:0%
purpose of this is to reimburse towns
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
for land that was is essentially no
 
00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:07.460 align:start position:0%
longer taxable
 
00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
as a result of flood control that's been
 
00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
done on the Merrimack River Valley in
 
00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
the Connecticut River Valley so
 
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
um there is land that municipalities
 
00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
used to receive Revenue taxes from that
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
they no longer do because we are trying
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
to control the flooding of these Rivers
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
expanded the rivers tax land is now
 
00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:29.220 align:start position:0%
under the river
 
00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
so the states of Massachusetts
 
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and New Hampshire reimbursed
 
00:46:35.569 --> 00:46:35.579 align:start position:0%
the municipalities for that
 
00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:37.859 align:start position:0%
the fiscal 24 and 25 budget amounts
 
00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
assumes that Massachusetts will
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
reimburse their share of the 70 of the
 
00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
Merrimack River Valley compact as well
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
as 50 percent of the Connecticut River
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
Valley Compact and the state of
 
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
Connecticut will reimburse their share
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
of 40 percent of the Connecticut River
 
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
Valley compact
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
as you may know there is a long history
 
00:46:56.329 --> 00:46:56.339 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts not paying its
 
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
obligation timely or sufficiently for
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
the Merrimack River Valley compact
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
although I am happy to report
 
00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
outstanding amounts for fiscal years
 
00:47:08.569 --> 00:47:08.579 align:start position:0%
2015 through 2022 were recently settled
 
00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:11.339 align:start position:0%
and we received a payment of almost 3.5
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
million dollars by the state of
 
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.750 align:start position:0%
million dollars by the state of
Connecticut

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
Connecticut
 
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the Commonwealth of
 
00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:19.250 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
the governor is authorized to draw a
 
00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
warrant for the payment of
 
00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
reimbursements out of the money in the
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
treasury that's not otherwise
 
00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
appropriated so when they don't pay the
 
00:47:29.809 --> 00:47:29.819 align:start position:0%
governor draws a warrant
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
so the towns are always made whole it's
 
00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:34.220 align:start position:0%
really just the
 
00:47:37.069 --> 00:47:37.079 align:start position:0%
disagreement between the state of New
 
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the state of Massachusetts
 
00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
so we are all caught up through fiscal
 
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
year 2022 we have not yet received
 
00:47:47.809 --> 00:47:47.819 align:start position:0%
payment for fiscal year 2023 that was
 
00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
not part of the settlement 2023 is not
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
over yet we may still receive payment if
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
we don't we will request the governor to
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
um is there a basis upon which they're
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
not paying or are they just not paying
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
do they have any argument
 
00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:11.940 align:start position:0%
I was not part of the settlement
 
00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
discussions that was um
 
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
managed through the Attorney General's
 
00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.170 align:start position:0%
managed through the Attorney General's
office

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:20.030 align:start position:0%
office
um

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
I don't so I can't really answer that
 
00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.470 align:start position:0%
I don't so I can't really answer that
question

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire thank you do any of
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
these funds are they used for building
 
00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
or maintaining dams or other flood
 
00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
control structures nope there's they go
 
00:48:41.089 --> 00:48:41.099 align:start position:0%
right back to the municipalities to
 
00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
reimburse them for the the land taxes
 
00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
that were lost essentially by
 
00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:49.980 align:start position:0%
um by the river expanding I see because
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
I might argue they're not providing
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
services to people who are not living in
 
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
those places and therefore their
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
expenses are less right so anyway all
 
00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
right thank you it's been a long debate
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
this division yes I think what 12 towns
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
or something that I know my town is one
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
of them but Hopkinton and Henniker
 
00:49:12.119 --> 00:49:12.829 align:start position:0%
of them but Hopkinton and Henniker
um

00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:12.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:20.809 --> 00:49:20.819 align:start position:0%
when the river yep and this is not the
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
first settlement that we've entered into
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
with the state of Massachusetts the the
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
pattern has been that there um is a
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
period of time for which payments are
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
not made we negotiate a settlement we
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
receive payment then we go through a
 
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
um so the last settlement prior to the
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
current one was in 2014 and then you'll
 
00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
see that the most recent settlement
 
00:49:44.569 --> 00:49:44.579 align:start position:0%
starts in 2015 through 2022. it's it's
 
00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
very interesting because they're a
 
00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
commissioner's set up I think Jerry
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
knows this well but just different
 
00:49:52.849 --> 00:49:52.859 align:start position:0%
Commissioners from different states but
 
00:49:55.849 --> 00:49:55.859 align:start position:0%
you can have a deadlock and nothing gets
 
00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
done the way they set it up as far as
 
00:49:59.569 --> 00:49:59.579 align:start position:0%
members but it's been an ongoing problem
 
00:50:02.329 --> 00:50:02.339 align:start position:0%
since the 50s yeah so but they're like
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
national parks in a sense because
 
00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
they're owned by the federal government
 
00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
uh yes represent Griffin
 
00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
um did we get the full amount or is this
 
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
some kind of a
 
00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
I believe that was the full amount or
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
very close to
 
00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:24.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
I see it yes it was
 
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
30 30 cents
 
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
um if there's one thing that we are we
 
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
are accurate
 
00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:34.849 align:start position:0%
are accurate
um

00:50:34.849 --> 00:50:34.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:38.089 --> 00:50:38.099 align:start position:0%
so I I believe that is very close to if
 
00:50:38.099 --> 00:50:39.170 align:start position:0%
so I I believe that is very close to if
not

00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
um the full amount that was outstanding
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
um without interest for the period of
 
00:50:47.569 --> 00:50:47.579 align:start position:0%
time representative Sweeney thank you Mr
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
chair so how do we evaluate or value the
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
land that's underwater do we take what
 
00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:56.700 align:start position:0%
it was before it was flooded and then
 
00:50:59.690 --> 00:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
just do a formula to today's projected
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
value or we do that at the dra I believe
 
00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
looking at the equalized value knowing
 
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
how much land in that town was subject
 
00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:11.270 align:start position:0%
how much land in that town was subject
to

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:13.609 --> 00:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
um the flooding of the river and looking
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
at the current value what we believe to
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
be the current value of the land so we
 
00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
do that calculation every year on a
 
00:51:23.329 --> 00:51:23.339 align:start position:0%
yearly basis thank you
 
00:51:23.339 --> 00:51:26.650 align:start position:0%
yearly basis thank you
okay

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:26.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
page 13 just a couple of small
 
00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:34.140 align:start position:0%
accounting units land taxes lost on page
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
60. this is the state and federal
 
00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.089 align:start position:0%
60. this is the state and federal
forests

00:51:38.089 --> 00:51:38.099 align:start position:0%
forests
 
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
um so the amount of money that
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
um is paid to reimburse those
 
00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities and this reflects the
 
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
current acreage values and tax rates and
 
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
then we have the current use board and
 
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
the assessing Standards Board these are
 
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
both administratively attached boards to
 
00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
the dra and the amounts reflect the per
 
00:51:58.510 --> 00:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
diem rates in in-state travel
 
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for folks that attend
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
those meetings
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
on page 14 we have the low and moderate
 
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
hardship grants so this is the money at
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
the beginning that was coming from the
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
you will see if you look at fiscal 23
 
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized of 800 000 and then
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget for 24 and 25 at
 
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
one and a half million in each year that
 
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
is a result of chapter 95 the laws of
 
00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
2021 that increased the income
 
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
limitations and the maximum amount of
 
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
tax relief available for the program
 
00:52:40.849 --> 00:52:40.859 align:start position:0%
so that change was effective for the
 
00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
April 1st 2021 property tax year and we
 
00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:46.750 align:start position:0%
April 1st 2021 property tax year and we
had

00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
5918 claims issued totaling 1.4 million
 
00:52:53.049 --> 00:52:53.059 align:start position:0%
compared to
 
00:52:56.569 --> 00:52:56.579 align:start position:0%
5572 claims totaling 800 000 for the
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
prior year so that increases just
 
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
strictly a result of that change in the
 
00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:02.750 align:start position:0%
strictly a result of that change in the
law

00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
um we are fine for 23 even though we are
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
going to over spend that appropriation
 
00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
because again the governor can draw a
 
00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:12.260 align:start position:0%
warrant to satisfy the state's
 
00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
sure representative Sweeney or thank you
 
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so on the uh hardship grants
 
00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:34.460 align:start position:0%
there were
 
00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:38.780 align:start position:0%
330 more claims and it totaled 700 000
 
00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
because the amount per claim also
 
00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
increased so more people became eligible
 
00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
and then the amount that they received
 
00:53:48.049 --> 00:53:48.059 align:start position:0%
increased as well all right thank you
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
president Griffin you know I'd like to
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:58.849 --> 00:53:58.859 align:start position:0%
it seems to me
 
00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
that if adding
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
two two new auditors
 
00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
brings in three million dollars which is
 
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
fair and excess of a cost
 
00:54:11.569 --> 00:54:11.579 align:start position:0%
uh it seems to me that it would be a
 
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
logical thing to do but I'd like to know
 
00:54:17.809 --> 00:54:17.819 align:start position:0%
at what point does diminishing returns
 
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
if I if I added four Auditors would I
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
get six million if I added eight would I
 
00:54:28.849 --> 00:54:28.859 align:start position:0%
get 12 million that's a great question I
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
don't know the exact you know Tipping
 
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.809 align:start position:0%
don't know the exact you know Tipping
Point

00:54:32.809 --> 00:54:32.819 align:start position:0%
Point
 
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
um but you know these are our
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
multi-state tax Auditors they are audit
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
large multinational businesses you know
 
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
think Fortune 500 type large businesses
 
00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:47.220 align:start position:0%
so yes at a point we might
 
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
start to not see as many of those large
 
00:54:52.849 --> 00:54:52.859 align:start position:0%
returns from those large businesses
 
00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
because they're looking at kind of a
 
00:54:56.349 --> 00:54:56.359 align:start position:0%
defined population
 
00:54:59.089 --> 00:54:59.099 align:start position:0%
we would also run into the issue I'm not
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
sure that I can train you know we would
 
00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:02.940 align:start position:0%
be able to sufficiently train you know
 
00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
10 new Auditors so I'm comfortable with
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
the two that we're requesting if you're
 
00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
like let's make it five I might say I
 
00:55:13.609 --> 00:55:13.619 align:start position:0%
don't know that I can you know actively
 
00:55:16.609 --> 00:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
um train and bring on those many
 
00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:18.900 align:start position:0%
Auditors and still generate this type of
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
return because what happens is at least
 
00:55:24.049 --> 00:55:24.059 align:start position:0%
in the first year they buddy up and they
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
go and train with an existing auditor so
 
00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
they'll travel
 
00:55:29.809 --> 00:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
to an audit location with one of our
 
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
more experienced Auditors and so there's
 
00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
there's a training need that occurs so
 
00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
yes there is there is a point of
 
00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
diminishing returns and it's something
 
00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
more than two and
 
00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
represent uh Maguire thank you Mr
 
00:55:57.770 --> 00:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
chairman so um I'm inclined with
 
00:55:59.930 --> 00:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin to add these two
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
positions as well as the municipal
 
00:56:04.849 --> 00:56:04.859 align:start position:0%
auditor but to satisfy representative
 
00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
cambrose could you maybe identify three
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
vacant positions that we could eliminate
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
and without too much trouble because
 
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
they're already big sure thank you yeah
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
because right now
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
um we have six unfunded positions here
 
00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
we're asking to fund three I would be
 
00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
comfortable most likely but I will
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
confirm uh most likely just strictly
 
00:56:32.329 --> 00:56:32.339 align:start position:0%
unfunding or eliminating the remaining
 
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
three that that are unfunded but we will
 
00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
so no more questions apparently on your
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
budget but how about House Bill too
 
00:56:47.809 --> 00:56:47.819 align:start position:0%
there are a number of items I noticed
 
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
there sure so actually one last point
 
00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:54.180 align:start position:0%
before we move on to House Bill 2 I
 
00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:55.740 align:start position:0%
meant to mention this when we were
 
00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:56:59.870 --> 00:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
rims the revenue information management
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
system I believe when the treasurer
 
00:57:04.569 --> 00:57:04.579 align:start position:0%
State Treasurer was here in front of you
 
00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
she mentioned potentially moving the
 
00:57:11.569 --> 00:57:11.579 align:start position:0%
debt service related to rims into dra's
 
00:57:11.579 --> 00:57:13.069 align:start position:0%
debt service related to rims into dra's
budget

00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:57:14.809 --> 00:57:14.819 align:start position:0%
um that idea
 
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
um is something that we would not be in
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
favor of I've also spoken with the
 
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
governor's office and the department of
 
00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
administrative services and
 
00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
none of us are in favor of doing that
 
00:57:31.609 --> 00:57:31.619 align:start position:0%
the reason is because although
 
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
the rims Debt Service will be funded by
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue uplift we talked about this
 
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
during our meet and greet meeting
 
00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
the 30 million one hundred and sixty
 
00:57:44.569 --> 00:57:44.579 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar Capital appropriation
 
00:57:47.569 --> 00:57:47.579 align:start position:0%
six million dollars of that is funded
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
principal and interest is funded by the
 
00:57:53.329 --> 00:57:53.339 align:start position:0%
general fund the remaining 24 million
 
00:57:55.609 --> 00:57:55.619 align:start position:0%
one hundred and sixty thousand dollars
 
00:57:58.010 --> 00:57:58.020 align:start position:0%
of principal and interest will be funded
 
00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
by Revenue uplift that the system
 
00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
generates and the dra transfers up to
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
four million dollars a year into this
 
00:58:09.049 --> 00:58:09.059 align:start position:0%
rims Revenue uplift fund that will fund
 
00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:11.220 align:start position:0%
that debt service
 
00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
however I can't guarantee and this is
 
00:58:16.849 --> 00:58:16.859 align:start position:0%
what the department of administrative
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
Services said as well
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
our duty under the statute is to
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
transfer up to four million dollars
 
00:58:25.609 --> 00:58:25.619 align:start position:0%
I can't guarantee that we will transfer
 
00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
four million dollars every year we did
 
00:58:29.089 --> 00:58:29.099 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
um but there is a risk that that rims
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
Revenue uplift account would not have
 
00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
the sufficient funding to pay the
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
principal and interest therefore the
 
00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:38.220 align:start position:0%
general fund would pay it and the rims
 
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
Revenue uplift account would pay the
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
general fund back when there were
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
sufficient funds so in that sense this
 
00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
is not a self-funded
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
we're not a self-funded agency this is
 
00:58:53.569 --> 00:58:53.579 align:start position:0%
not a self-funded Debt Service
 
00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
um it has a dedicated fund associated
 
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
with it but it's not exactly self-funded
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
so we would not be in favor of um moving
 
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
The Debt Service from treasury's budget
 
00:59:05.569 --> 00:59:05.579 align:start position:0%
into dra's budget so I just wanted to
 
00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
touch on that because I know that was a
 
00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
question that came up previously
 
00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
so since you're mainly General funded
 
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
and lacking 26 funded positions do you
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
have any idea what you'll be returning
 
00:59:20.569 --> 00:59:20.579 align:start position:0%
to the general fund at the
 
00:59:22.609 --> 00:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
I don't have that number
 
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
um in front of me
 
00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:28.190 align:start position:0%
um in front of me
um

00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
our budget outside of salary and
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
benefits is very tight for us this year
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
you know even though we are 75 percent
 
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
people with salary and benefits when
 
00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
there are excess in those accounts we
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
can't use that money to fund other
 
00:59:44.809 --> 00:59:44.819 align:start position:0%
things you know so I can't take a vacant
 
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
position and go buy a state car that I
 
00:59:48.289 --> 00:59:48.299 align:start position:0%
desperately need
 
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
um so we're feeling pretty tight this
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
year because of that because most of our
 
00:59:56.690 --> 00:59:56.700 align:start position:0%
excess is in salary and benefits and I
 
00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
don't have the same flexibility with
 
00:59:59.809 --> 00:59:59.819 align:start position:0%
that money
 
00:59:59.819 --> 01:00:01.130 align:start position:0%
that money
um

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:01.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
if that kind of answers your question
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
I know you let don't like the use the
 
01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:09.780 align:start position:0%
word refunds yeah
 
01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
so anyway are there any more questions
 
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
at least on the budget portion and if
 
01:00:17.329 --> 01:00:17.339 align:start position:0%
not we'll move to House Bill too I'm
 
01:00:17.339 --> 01:00:18.289 align:start position:0%
not we'll move to House Bill too I'm
sure

01:00:18.289 --> 01:00:18.299 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
we have the first one around 103 section
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
10 section 101 101 to 109. oh yeah a
 
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
little Communications tax repeal
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax repeal
 
01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:36.059 align:start position:0%
so section 101 page 36 those of you look
 
01:00:36.059 --> 01:00:37.210 align:start position:0%
so section 101 page 36 those of you look
correct

01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:37.220 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
repeals the communication Services tax
 
01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
effective July 1.
 
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
Section 102 still on page 36 starting on
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
line 25.
 
01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
what this does is allows the dra to
 
01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
still perform audit and collections
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
activity on this tax this language is
 
01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
identical or very similar to language
 
01:01:03.289 --> 01:01:03.299 align:start position:0%
that is currently in statute relative to
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
the interest in dividends tax so we
 
01:01:07.849 --> 01:01:07.859 align:start position:0%
still or we would like to still have the
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
ability to perform collections activity
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
on outstanding debts to still audit
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
taxpayers for the years in which the tax
 
01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
was in place
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
without this and just the straight
 
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
repeal of the tax we don't have the
 
01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:25.140 align:start position:0%
clear authority to continue to do that
 
01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:27.900 align:start position:0%
so I I'll have to back up a little bit
 
01:01:31.849 --> 01:01:31.859 align:start position:0%
back to the repeal 101
 
01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:35.220 align:start position:0%
did Ways and Means support the repeal
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
that seven percent or did they leave it
 
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
do we I believe they have that's right I
 
01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
believe they haven't voted on it yet
 
01:01:44.329 --> 01:01:44.339 align:start position:0%
they haven't voted on it they have a
 
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
bill that does exactly that correct okay
 
01:01:49.609 --> 01:01:49.619 align:start position:0%
so we still don't know we still don't
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
know correct so just a quick question
 
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
yes represent people so the bottom line
 
01:01:57.289 --> 01:01:57.299 align:start position:0%
is if the if the tax is not repealed
 
01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
then you don't need the language in 103.
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
102 correct if the tax is not repealed
 
01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
there's no need for any of these
 
01:02:08.829 --> 01:02:08.839 align:start position:0%
sections so
 
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
102 through 109 is specifically related
 
01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
to the uh the repeal so section 101 goes
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
away we're not going to repeal the tax
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
we don't need any of the remaining
 
01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.069 align:start position:0%
we don't need any of the remaining
sections

01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
sections
 
01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
well that's very helpful for the LBA and
 
01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:26.220 align:start position:0%
the rest of us so I guess they better
 
01:02:29.569 --> 01:02:29.579 align:start position:0%
not repeal the taxes
 
01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:31.799 align:start position:0%
um and that's about what 30 million a
 
01:02:31.799 --> 01:02:32.770 align:start position:0%
um and that's about what 30 million a
year

01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:32.780 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
so that is between 25 and 30 million a
 
01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
year it was closer to 40 45 million this
 
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
is a tax that's been declining in recent
 
01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:46.849 align:start position:0%
is a tax that's been declining in recent
years

01:02:46.849 --> 01:02:46.859 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
um for a number of reasons
 
01:02:49.799 --> 01:02:51.470 align:start position:0%
um for a number of reasons
one

01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:52.730 align:start position:0%
one
um

01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:52.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:55.619 align:start position:0%
you know 15 years ago 20 years ago this
 
01:02:58.370 --> 01:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
tax was primarily on landlines right
 
01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
now there's fewer landlines
 
01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
um so for a while though you had a
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
landline and you had a cell phone so
 
01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
that was two taxable things now very few
 
01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:09.650 align:start position:0%
that was two taxable things now very few
people

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
have landlines and everybody has a cell
 
01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:13.490 align:start position:0%
have landlines and everybody has a cell
phone

01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
phone
 
01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
so now we get to the cell phone problem
 
01:03:19.609 --> 01:03:19.619 align:start position:0%
the cell phone is a combination of
 
01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
calling and texting which are is taxable
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's two-way communication under the
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax but it is
 
01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
also data in its internet access
 
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
we cannot tax internet access there's a
 
01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
federal prohibition against that New
 
01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was grandfathered in we were
 
01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
taxing internet access however that has
 
01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
since been repealed and we can no longer
 
01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
tax that because we are prohibited
 
01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:46.789 align:start position:0%
tax that because we are prohibited
federally

01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
federally
 
01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
so when you have a cell phone and you
 
01:03:50.329 --> 01:03:50.339 align:start position:0%
have a cell phone bill
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
the amount on your bill that's taxable
 
01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
depends on how your wireless provider
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
allocates that bill to talk and text
 
01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
versus data and what we're seeing is
 
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
more and more providers because this is
 
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
also the trend right more and more
 
01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
providers are allocating more of your
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
bill to the data portion more people are
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
using their phone to access the internet
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
and not to talk on it
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
um so that is decreasing the taxable
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
base of the communication Services tax
 
01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
so we are seeing it between the 25 and
 
01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
30 million each year but it had been as
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
high as 40 and 45 but it's just kind of
 
01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
all right represent required how many
 
01:04:36.589 --> 01:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
employees are specifically assigned to
 
01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
this tax and not any others nothing
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
nobody just one employee he does this as
 
01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
part of his other work
 
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
I would be interested in
 
01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
you said overall you collect you spend
 
01:04:52.849 --> 01:04:52.859 align:start position:0%
half a percent to collect everything you
 
01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
collect yeah but I'd be interested to
 
01:04:58.010 --> 01:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
see how that breaks down tax by tax do
 
01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
you do you have that
 
01:05:00.359 --> 01:05:01.910 align:start position:0%
you do you have that
um

01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit more granularity right you
 
01:05:06.049 --> 01:05:06.059 align:start position:0%
know what's the hardest tax to collect
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
what's the easiest amen I probably don't
 
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
have it broken down in that much detail
 
01:05:15.049 --> 01:05:15.059 align:start position:0%
because it would require
 
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:18.140 align:start position:0%
my employees did detail
 
01:05:20.569 --> 01:05:20.579 align:start position:0%
everything they kind of because there's
 
01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
lots of employees who do who do multiple
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
tax types but when we were here for the
 
01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
meet and greet we talked about the
 
01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax and how
 
01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
you know we receive
 
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
70 million or 70 000 returns for you
 
01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
know a hundred million dollars we also
 
01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
receive 70 000 business tax returns for
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
1.2 billion dollars
 
01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
um so the the amount of time though that
 
01:05:48.049 --> 01:05:48.059 align:start position:0%
employees stand spend on the various
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
taxes tends to track with the amount of
 
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue we receive from that tax which
 
01:05:54.049 --> 01:05:54.059 align:start position:0%
is why when you talk about the
 
01:05:56.270 --> 01:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax generating
 
01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
between 25 and 30 million I've got part
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
of one employee working on that for the
 
01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
most part well that's a pretty good
 
01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.069 align:start position:0%
most part well that's a pretty good
return

01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
return
 
01:06:04.079 --> 01:06:06.049 align:start position:0%
return
yeah

01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:06.059 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
phone defaults to
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
to call over Wi-Fi then that's an
 
01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
untaxable call most likely because
 
01:06:26.569 --> 01:06:26.579 align:start position:0%
that's a likely attributed to internet
 
01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:29.579 align:start position:0%
access on your on your bill
 
01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
um and and we do you know when we added
 
01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
the the providers we asked them for a
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
breakdown of what they allocate to you
 
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
know internet access versus call versus
 
01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
text on the plans and you know we you
 
01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:46.740 align:start position:0%
know ask them to substantiate why that
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
is the correct breakdown so I mean we we
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
do press them on that but it's just a
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
basic truth that the majority of of what
 
01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:55.980 align:start position:0%
you're doing on your phone is not
 
01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
actually talking to anyone anymore right
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
a lot more happens over email
 
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
and there are no stupid questions here
 
01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
otherwise we'd all be in trouble
 
01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
so okay oh sorry that's okay so I assume
 
01:07:13.849 --> 01:07:13.859 align:start position:0%
this tax is
 
01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
um common nationally the communications
 
01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:17.690 align:start position:0%
um common nationally the communications
tax

01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
I believe this is a common tax in most
 
01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
other states yeah it's not like we're
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
unusual correct
 
01:07:26.569 --> 01:07:26.579 align:start position:0%
so going through the remaining sections
 
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
if I may in House Bill 2 related to CST
 
01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
just to kind of
 
01:07:33.289 --> 01:07:33.299 align:start position:0%
explain what they do
 
01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
section 103 on page 36 so we
 
01:07:43.010 --> 01:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
um assist the Department of Safety in
 
01:07:47.569 --> 01:07:47.579 align:start position:0%
auditing the e911 surcharges and our
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
authority to do that to work with them
 
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
to do that currently resides in the
 
01:07:56.089 --> 01:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
Communication Service tax statute so if
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
you repeal the Communication Service tax
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
statute you would repeal our ability to
 
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
assist them so we're basically just
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
moving that function into 21j which is
 
01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
the dra's statute so that would just
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
allow us to keep doing what we're doing
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
relative to e911 with the Department of
 
01:08:15.070 --> 01:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
Safety that's really sections
 
01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
do you have a cost of what that costs
 
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
your department to
 
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
again it's part of one person's time the
 
01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
same person yeah okay yep so he would
 
01:08:34.729 --> 01:08:34.739 align:start position:0%
still assist with doing that um and he
 
01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
ought also audits other tax types so if
 
01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
he was no longer auditing CSD he would
 
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
just move to auditing another tax type
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
although that's why the provision in 102
 
01:08:47.329 --> 01:08:47.339 align:start position:0%
is important because we want to make
 
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
sure that you know this idea is out on
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
the street right now right people are
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
aware that there's the potential repeal
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
of the tax we want to make sure that no
 
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
one stops collecting and remitting the
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
tax before it is actually repealed so we
 
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
will perform audit activity on this tax
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
even after it's been repealed to make
 
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
sure that what was collected and
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
um and then sections 107 108 and 109
 
01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
those just remove references to CST so
 
01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
if you repeal the tax we'll just remove
 
01:09:20.269 --> 01:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
the reference so there's really no
 
01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
impact there it's just making sure the
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:29.329 --> 01:09:29.339 align:start position:0%
so just on the auditing for the CST I'm
 
01:09:29.339 --> 01:09:31.430 align:start position:0%
so just on the auditing for the CST I'm
getting

01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:32.030 align:start position:0%
getting
um

01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
are there are not that many they're not
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
that many providers right there aren't
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
that many people that would have to be
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
audited I was thinking about your cost
 
01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
of collection right it is a fairly
 
01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
defined group
 
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
um you know it is you're but it I mean
 
01:09:49.249 --> 01:09:49.259 align:start position:0%
it's your telephone companies it's your
 
01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
wireless providers it's your video
 
01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:53.329 align:start position:0%
wireless providers it's your video
conferencing

01:09:53.329 --> 01:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
conferencing
 
01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
um to the extent that that it's actual
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
video conferencing and not just internet
 
01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
access so it's a decent
 
01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
um population of taxpayers
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
um but it is fairly manageable it is a
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
monthly tax so when that language
 
01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned all also exists in the
 
01:10:14.689 --> 01:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
repeal of the IND statute
 
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:17.460 align:start position:0%
that tax is only remitted once a year it
 
01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
will take us some time after that final
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
IND tax year is complete in order to
 
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
fully audit it will not take us as long
 
01:10:27.169 --> 01:10:27.179 align:start position:0%
to wrap up CST because it is a monthly
 
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
file tax
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire pointed out to me
 
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
it looks like 110 would also fall into
 
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
state of emergency waiver of yeah
 
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
because it's using a definition that's
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:59.830 align:start position:0%
 
definition

01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
I believe that is true that is not
 
01:11:06.649 --> 01:11:06.659 align:start position:0%
language that I assisted with yet so not
 
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
my section but yes I believe this is
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
also relative to the repeal of the tax
 
01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.950 align:start position:0%
also relative to the repeal of the tax
correct

01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.410 align:start position:0%
correct
correct

01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:35.330 align:start position:0%
correct
correct

01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
that's great sure
 
01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
doing my best
 
01:11:52.729 --> 01:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
I'm doing my best so yes we will get
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
that information
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
um to to the LBA those specific position
 
01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:00.900 align:start position:0%
numbers to fund confirm the amounts and
 
01:12:03.649 --> 01:12:03.659 align:start position:0%
the three positions to unfund
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
um or eliminate sorry so our position
 
01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
count will actually go down we'll go
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
down to uh 157 positions
 
01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:19.729 align:start position:0%
down to uh 157 positions
okay

01:12:19.729 --> 01:12:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
quick question we we need to be clear on
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
eliminating because they're already
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
unfunded yes
 
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
so we'll need the position numbers right
 
01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:39.890 align:start position:0%
so we'll need the position numbers right
yeah

01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
no is that wrong
 
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
if they're already unfunded then yeah
 
01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
all we're gaining is that their total
 
01:12:49.610 --> 01:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
number of employees doesn't change we're
 
01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
not really gaining money if you want to
 
01:12:51.719 --> 01:12:52.850 align:start position:0%
not really gaining money if you want to
eliminate

01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
01:12:56.090 --> 01:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
so for the first few uh well these guys
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
are training going out with a different
 
01:12:58.320 --> 01:12:59.870 align:start position:0%
are training going out with a different
auditor

01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
auditor
 
01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
there's no gain it's just six pounds
 
01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
yeah true so what oh so we should only
 
01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
add one and a half no no well I didn't
 
01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
mean true
 
01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:11.810 align:start position:0%
mean true
um

01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
um what will
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
our total number
 
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.689 align:start position:0%
our total number
of

01:13:20.689 --> 01:13:20.699 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
let me see if I say this right so our
 
01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:24.770 align:start position:0%
let me see if I say this right so our
our

01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
employees right we'll actually go down
 
01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
to 153.
 
01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
because we will eliminate I believe that
 
01:13:35.410 --> 01:13:35.420 align:start position:0%
the request is to eliminate three
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
so that's not gonna you're not gonna I
 
01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
guess to your point you're not gonna get
 
01:13:44.810 --> 01:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
a pickup
 
01:13:47.450 --> 01:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
of a decreased expense because those are
 
01:13:50.450 --> 01:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
already unfunded yes I'm looking at the
 
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
budget so we eliminate three unfunded
 
01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
positions we don't pick up anything
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
correct we hire these new people let's
 
01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
see yeah before they start producing the
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
three million correct so so we really
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
should only add one million is that what
 
01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
because we're adding half a million of
 
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.750 align:start position:0%
because we're adding half a million of
expense

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
expense
 
01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
so maybe that was what the governor was
 
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
thinking when he
 
01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:18.300 align:start position:0%
when he when he took it out left them
 
01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:19.669 align:start position:0%
when he when he took it out left them
unfunded

01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
but you're still gaining quite a bit no
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
I don't it's in that game but is that
 
01:14:27.709 --> 01:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
right should we should we not expect so
 
01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
the way two years worth of this income
 
01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
so what we've done in the past is that
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
when we when the LBA prepares the
 
01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement relative to these
 
01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
positions there is zero additional
 
01:14:39.239 --> 01:14:40.729 align:start position:0%
positions there is zero additional
Revenue

01:14:40.729 --> 01:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 24 and we would put one and a
 
01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
half million of additional revenue for
 
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
each position in 25. so in this case you
 
01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
would see Zero additional Revenue in 24
 
01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
and you would see three million and 25.
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
that will go on the Surplus statement
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
for the revenues and then the expenses
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
will just be what the expenses are to
 
01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
fund those positions so we don't have to
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
the budget does the work of netting it
 
01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:09.950 align:start position:0%
the budget does the work of netting it
out

01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.189 --> 01:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
I guess like this is 30 years of age
 
01:15:24.169 --> 01:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
so do we just clarify to Mike's question
 
01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
do we still want to proceed with on do
 
01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
we still want to proceed with producing
 
01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
the reducing the position count by those
 
01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
three positions okay
 
01:15:42.530 --> 01:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so we should monitor what ways
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
and means is doing with the bill
 
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
so maybe you guys can Melissa
 
01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
yeah I sent an email I believe last
 
01:16:04.610 --> 01:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
night on this bill they're hearing they
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
have the executive session today at 1 15
 
01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
I believe so we will keep an eye on that
 
01:16:11.330 --> 01:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
and I'll shoot another email with what
 
01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
the results are of that executive
 
01:20:03.890 --> 01:20:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
not to keep you here any longer um
 
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
please state your name for the record
 
01:20:11.149 --> 01:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
please good morning my name is Doug
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
Ingersoll I'm the executive director and
 
01:20:17.930 --> 01:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
Council for the Public Employee Labor
 
01:20:19.970 --> 01:20:19.980 align:start position:0%
Relations Board I've worked for the
 
01:20:22.810 --> 01:20:22.820 align:start position:0%
board since uh
 
01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:24.410 align:start position:0%
board since uh
2006.

01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
2006.
 
01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:25.189 align:start position:0%
2006.
um

01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:29.209 --> 01:20:29.219 align:start position:0%
before I dive into our limited materials
 
01:20:29.219 --> 01:20:30.950 align:start position:0%
before I dive into our limited materials
okay

01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:20:35.689 --> 01:20:35.699 align:start position:0%
I feel like having witnessed the dras
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
presentation I should have been here
 
01:20:39.649 --> 01:20:39.659 align:start position:0%
first as a warm-up act that was pretty
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
intense and comprehensive very
 
01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:42.790 align:start position:0%
intense and comprehensive very
impressive

01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
impressive
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
and also your ability to follow and ask
 
01:20:48.890 --> 01:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
pertinent questions is impressive
 
01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
reference to the ongoing
 
01:20:56.930 --> 01:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
reclassification project headed by Das
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
and and a mention of the federal
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
classification standard it's it's called
 
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
the 2018
 
01:21:09.229 --> 01:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
standard occupational classification or
 
01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
soc for short
 
01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
and if you Google that you'll you'll get
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
into it it's not it's not actually the
 
01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
system that the federal government uses
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
to classify its own workers it's it's
 
01:21:24.010 --> 01:21:24.020 align:start position:0%
for purposes of data collection
 
01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:27.260 align:start position:0%
dissemination and Analysis
 
01:21:30.649 --> 01:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
obviously commissioner Arlene house is
 
01:21:32.570 --> 01:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
the expert who can give you
 
01:21:35.810 --> 01:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
a detailed explanation on why
 
01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
they're using that to
 
01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:40.739 align:start position:0%
migrate the current classification
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
positions into this new system and what
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
the benefits will be
 
01:21:46.679 --> 01:21:48.890 align:start position:0%
the benefits will be
um

01:21:48.890 --> 01:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.790 --> 01:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
so I for reference I think we're at page
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
315 and 316 of the budget book
 
01:21:59.689 --> 01:21:59.699 align:start position:0%
um are as usual and I think
 
01:22:02.930 --> 01:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
I've done this six or seven times are
 
01:22:05.450 --> 01:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
I always say that our our proposed
 
01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:06.770 align:start position:0%
I always say that our our proposed
budget

01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
um and our method of operations are
 
01:22:11.709 --> 01:22:11.719 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same
 
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of new things that we
 
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
have in here but none of the amounts are
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
terribly significant and I think it's a
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
pretty efficient way
 
01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:26.950 align:start position:0%
pretty efficient way
to

01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
manage the state collective bargaining
 
01:22:31.610 --> 01:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
in the public sector in New Hampshire
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
when you take into account
 
01:22:36.530 --> 01:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
all the public employers and employees
 
01:22:39.050 --> 01:22:39.060 align:start position:0%
who are affected or involved by the
 
01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:40.490 align:start position:0%
who are affected or involved by the
process

01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:41.450 align:start position:0%
process
um

01:22:41.450 --> 01:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:43.930 --> 01:22:43.940 align:start position:0%
the board itself has been in place since
 
01:22:46.990 --> 01:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
1976. we have a nine-member board
 
01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
equally represented by people with
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
backgrounds in management in labor and
 
01:22:55.250 --> 01:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
then on the public interest side that's
 
01:22:59.330 --> 01:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
where the the chairs come in the chairs
 
01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
since I've been with the board have
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
typically been practicing attorneys who
 
01:23:07.370 --> 01:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
have some familiarity with litigation
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
because we do function as an
 
01:23:11.330 --> 01:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
administrative tribunal and that kind of
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge and experience obviously is
 
01:23:15.770 --> 01:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
very handy and useful
 
01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
we have two professional staff myself
 
01:23:19.729 --> 01:23:19.739 align:start position:0%
included there's also another attorney
 
01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
and I'm assuming everybody has some
 
01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
passing familiarity with with what a
 
01:23:31.729 --> 01:23:31.739 align:start position:0%
public sector collective bargaining
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
involves but
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
couple highlights we determined the
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
bargaining units that operate in the
 
01:23:39.410 --> 01:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
state and we look at potential
 
01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
modifications of those bargaining units
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
to either add or remove positions and
 
01:23:46.970 --> 01:23:46.980 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's requests to be in
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
larger bargaining units to remove a
 
01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
large number of employees and and create
 
01:23:54.770 --> 01:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
a brand new independent unit they come
 
01:23:57.530 --> 01:23:57.540 align:start position:0%
the employers throughout the state come
 
01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
to us in the public sector with the
 
01:24:02.810 --> 01:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
unions to go through that process
 
01:24:05.209 --> 01:24:05.219 align:start position:0%
we conduct representation elections
 
01:24:06.649 --> 01:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
whenever there's an approved new
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit or if the employees in
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
an existing unit have decided uh or at
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
least a percentage have decided that
 
01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
they would like to discontinue
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
participation in the process or if they
 
01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:22.140 align:start position:0%
would like to switch to a different
 
01:24:26.090 --> 01:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
representative perhaps a rival Union and
 
01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
so we're the entity in the state that
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
conducts all those elections so it's
 
01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
done by a third party it's not the
 
01:24:34.850 --> 01:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
employer's responsibility it's not the
 
01:24:38.090 --> 01:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
Union's responsibility
 
01:24:42.130 --> 01:24:42.140 align:start position:0%
we hold evidentiary hearings
 
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
from representative McGuire yeah I need
 
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
some Basics here because I'm I'm really
 
01:24:48.530 --> 01:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
not familiar with your area so what's
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
the difference between a bargaining unit
 
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
and a union so the bargaining unit is
 
01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
the group of positions in a particular
 
01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.950 align:start position:0%
the group of positions in a particular
employer

01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
who are certified to participate in the
 
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining process we hold an
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
election and they choose who is going to
 
01:25:08.930 --> 01:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
represent them so typically when there's
 
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
an interest in forming a bargaining unit
 
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
a union will have visited the workplace
 
01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
discussed the whole process with
 
01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:17.090 align:start position:0%
discussed the whole process with
employees

01:25:17.090 --> 01:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
and they fill out and file the the
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
petition they have to submit
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
confidential cards that are signed by
 
01:25:25.490 --> 01:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
employees demonstrating that there's an
 
01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
interest and if we approve the
 
01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit we then have an election
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
and there will be two choices on the
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
ballot one will be the name of the union
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
and the other will be no representative
 
01:25:37.610 --> 01:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
so if a majority of the employees who
 
01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
show up to vote
 
01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
vote for the union then we will certify
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
that Union if they vote for no
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative then the process ends and
 
01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:48.060 align:start position:0%
there will be no collective bargaining
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
so follow up yeah so like dra who we
 
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
just saw is that one bargaining unit all
 
01:25:58.270 --> 01:25:58.280 align:start position:0%
of their employees or not necessarily
 
01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
it probably is I would have to look at
 
01:26:03.649 --> 01:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
the inventory of State units I think
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
there are approximately 57 different
 
01:26:09.050 --> 01:26:09.060 align:start position:0%
bargaining units in the state a large
 
01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
number of those are covered by a master
 
01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.149 align:start position:0%
number of those are covered by a master
contract

01:26:13.149 --> 01:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
contract
 
01:26:15.169 --> 01:26:15.179 align:start position:0%
represented by the state employees
 
01:26:15.179 --> 01:26:16.790 align:start position:0%
represented by the state employees
Association

01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
Association
 
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
there are I think a total of in addition
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
to that Master contract which covers
 
01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:23.940 align:start position:0%
multiple bargaining units I think there
 
01:26:26.209 --> 01:26:26.219 align:start position:0%
are approximately 13 other state
 
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
contracts in place and that will cover
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Troopers Department of
 
01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
Corrections in various different
 
01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:35.510 align:start position:0%
Corrections in various different
departments

01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
departments
 
01:26:38.689 --> 01:26:38.699 align:start position:0%
so could the let's say the dra employees
 
01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
decide we'd like to be part of the Das
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit or or maybe just the
 
01:26:47.209 --> 01:26:47.219 align:start position:0%
Auditors say we want our own bargaining
 
01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
unit or something like that I I think
 
01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely that they would uh look at
 
01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
another state bargaining unit and say we
 
01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
would like to merge with that because
 
01:26:57.290 --> 01:26:57.300 align:start position:0%
effectively they are under the master
 
01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:59.450 align:start position:0%
effectively they are under the master
contract

01:26:59.450 --> 01:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
contract
 
01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
um if they were interested in making a
 
01:27:05.209 --> 01:27:05.219 align:start position:0%
change and we have back in the pre-2010
 
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
time period we saw some cases like this
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
if they decided they didn't want to be
 
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
represented by the Sea anymore there's a
 
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
process for them to follow to to try to
 
01:27:17.209 --> 01:27:17.219 align:start position:0%
do that if they decided they wanted to
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
opt out of collective bargaining
 
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
altogether there's a process for them to
 
01:27:24.290 --> 01:27:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:26.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.629 --> 01:27:29.639 align:start position:0%
represents Schultz sorry Mr chair I mean
 
01:27:32.590 --> 01:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
it's maybe an oversimplification to say
 
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
but one is do you want a union or
 
01:27:39.050 --> 01:27:39.060 align:start position:0%
continue to have a union and the other
 
01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
is sort of within that Union with whom
 
01:27:46.729 --> 01:27:46.739 align:start position:0%
do you bargain is it as a large group or
 
01:27:49.610 --> 01:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
like localities oftentimes have their
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
own firefighters bargaining unit that's
 
01:27:53.689 --> 01:27:53.699 align:start position:0%
separate from
 
01:27:56.350 --> 01:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
or distinct under the state's
 
01:27:59.330 --> 01:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
firefighters Union
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
I think that's a maybe I just made it
 
01:28:04.189 --> 01:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
so so so so we're we're
 
01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:09.169 align:start position:0%
so so so so we're we're
um

01:28:09.169 --> 01:28:09.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
sort of obnoxious and always emphasizing
 
01:28:13.010 --> 01:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
the difference between bargaining units
 
01:28:14.810 --> 01:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
and unions I think it's more common for
 
01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
people to just say unions
 
01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
and they're sometimes referring to the
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit itself and sometimes
 
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
they're referring to either a
 
01:28:24.410 --> 01:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
professional Union or an independent
 
01:28:27.890 --> 01:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
group a lot of uh the professional
 
01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:30.780 align:start position:0%
unions have affiliations with larger
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
National groups so firefighters for
 
01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
example but if there's a
 
01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
firefighter bargaining unit in a
 
01:28:39.530 --> 01:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
particular town that bargaining unit is
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
a stand-alone bargaining unit but a lot
 
01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:42.780 align:start position:0%
of those
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
are represented by the International
 
01:28:47.629 --> 01:28:47.639 align:start position:0%
Association of firefighters affiliated
 
01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:57.410 --> 01:28:57.420 align:start position:0%
so when when we have proceedings on
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
bargaining units or proceedings on
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
unfair labor practices or some of the
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
other cases that gets get filed we have
 
01:29:06.290 --> 01:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
evidential hearings just like a trial
 
01:29:08.530 --> 01:29:08.540 align:start position:0%
court the difference is that we're
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
specialized which is sort of the nature
 
01:29:13.629 --> 01:29:13.639 align:start position:0%
of an administrative tribunal we issue
 
01:29:16.490 --> 01:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
comprehensive written decisions they're
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
published on our website
 
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
at any word or decision we issue was
 
01:29:22.669 --> 01:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
published on our web website usually
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
within two business days
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
and you can go back and look at
 
01:29:28.669 --> 01:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
basically every order and decision our
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
board has made dating back to 1976
 
01:29:34.689 --> 01:29:34.699 align:start position:0%
through our website
 
01:29:37.490 --> 01:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
by law we're also responsible for
 
01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
administration administering a neutral
 
01:29:43.490 --> 01:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
program which is designed to assist the
 
01:29:44.930 --> 01:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
parties if they're at a bargaining
 
01:29:47.810 --> 01:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
impasse this primarily consists of
 
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
appointing people with experience and
 
01:29:54.669 --> 01:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
contract in past mediation or contract
 
01:29:57.050 --> 01:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
impasse fact-finding
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
we also provide that list to parties who
 
01:30:02.810 --> 01:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
are interested in using it to select
 
01:30:05.209 --> 01:30:05.219 align:start position:0%
agreements arbitrators and we have a
 
01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
process that the parties go through for
 
01:30:10.250 --> 01:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
that the statute also allows the parties
 
01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
on their own to to agree to different
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
individuals there it's not mandatory
 
01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
so page four of our handout
 
01:30:27.530 --> 01:30:27.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm not going through the handout in
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
in detail I prepared some slides for my
 
01:30:31.370 --> 01:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
own reference just to try to hit the
 
01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:32.689 align:start position:0%
own reference just to try to hit the
highlights

01:30:32.689 --> 01:30:32.699 align:start position:0%
highlights
 
01:30:34.850 --> 01:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
but on that top paragraph you'll see
 
01:30:37.010 --> 01:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
there's a reference to an average over
 
01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
the past five years of approximately 102
 
01:30:42.590 --> 01:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
cases per year being filed and then
 
01:30:44.209 --> 01:30:44.219 align:start position:0%
there's a listing of the different kinds
 
01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
of cases
 
01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
that are in that number and then
 
01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
immediately below that is a
 
01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
condensed survey of the number of
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
bargaining units in the state by
 
01:30:57.229 --> 01:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
employer type which correlates to the
 
01:30:59.629 --> 01:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
number of contracts and I've notated in
 
01:31:02.689 --> 01:31:02.699 align:start position:0%
there how many of those contracts are
 
01:31:05.209 --> 01:31:05.219 align:start position:0%
what we call current and how many are
 
01:31:08.090 --> 01:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
expired so on a percentage basis
 
01:31:10.370 --> 01:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
across all in all public employers
 
01:31:12.110 --> 01:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
throughout the state who participate in
 
01:31:13.209 --> 01:31:13.219 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:31:16.930 --> 01:31:16.940 align:start position:0%
86 percent of the contracts are current
 
01:31:20.450 --> 01:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
which I based on my time with the board
 
01:31:22.729 --> 01:31:22.739 align:start position:0%
is a pretty healthy percentage it's
 
01:31:24.530 --> 01:31:24.540 align:start position:0%
never fluctuated
 
01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
much below 70. I don't know if it's ever
 
01:31:32.090 --> 01:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
been over 90. it's certainly possible
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to draw attention to any
 
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
of the particular employers but as you
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
go down the list you can
 
01:31:40.729 --> 01:31:40.739 align:start position:0%
go across the row and see where some of
 
01:31:43.129 --> 01:31:43.139 align:start position:0%
the differences are and and I can't give
 
01:31:45.229 --> 01:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
you any explanations
 
01:31:47.209 --> 01:31:47.219 align:start position:0%
based on the information I currently
 
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
have as to maybe why uh contract
 
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
negotiation is more successful with
 
01:31:54.290 --> 01:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
certain types of employers and less
 
01:31:57.770 --> 01:31:57.780 align:start position:0%
successful with others all of our all
 
01:31:59.570 --> 01:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
employers are required to file their
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
contracts with us within 14 days
 
01:32:05.330 --> 01:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
after their sign doesn't always happen
 
01:32:07.970 --> 01:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
but we've become pretty efficient at
 
01:32:09.229 --> 01:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
chasing them down and then they're
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
published on our website
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
so there's information there for people
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
who want to learn about the process and
 
01:32:17.570 --> 01:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
I think it's information that's also
 
01:32:19.850 --> 01:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
helpful to public employers and
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
employees who are engaged in the process
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
and they want to see what's happening
 
01:32:24.649 --> 01:32:24.659 align:start position:0%
with other similar bargaining units
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
do contracts lengths vary or they always
 
01:32:32.450 --> 01:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
like three years or something they do
 
01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:33.410 align:start position:0%
like three years or something they do
vary

01:32:33.410 --> 01:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
vary
 
01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:34.250 align:start position:0%
vary
um

01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:36.290 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

01:32:36.290 --> 01:32:36.300 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
so two or three years is not uncommon
 
01:32:42.110 --> 01:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
not uncommon but I I my sense is that at
 
01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
the county level it's a one-year
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
contract is more common
 
01:32:48.050 --> 01:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
you will see and I think this may be
 
01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
more true in education you will see
 
01:32:51.649 --> 01:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
contracts that are longer than a
 
01:32:52.970 --> 01:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
three-year duration obviously there's
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
upsides and downsides
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
so if you agree to a longer contract you
 
01:32:59.209 --> 01:32:59.219 align:start position:0%
could win depending on what your
 
01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
definition is of winning or you could
 
01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:02.229 align:start position:0%
definition is of winning or you could
lose

01:33:02.229 --> 01:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
lose
 
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
obviously if unanticipated circumstances
 
01:33:07.729 --> 01:33:07.739 align:start position:0%
arises there's always the potential to
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
reopen negotiations
 
01:33:14.090 --> 01:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
but in terms of uh approving any new
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
cost items that are negotiated there's
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
an approval process that happens through
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
the local legislative body and usually
 
01:33:23.090 --> 01:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
for example if you're at the municipal
 
01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
level you have to wait for town meeting
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
to come around I think in the for school
 
01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
districts there's more of an opportunity
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
to petition for a special meeting but
 
01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
it's an expensive
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:45.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin you know it looks
 
01:33:51.169 --> 01:33:51.179 align:start position:0%
like about half your increase this year
 
01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
is in the rents leases other than the
 
01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:56.510 align:start position:0%
is in the rents leases other than the
state

01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:58.970 align:start position:0%
state
line

01:33:58.970 --> 01:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
yes I'm just about to go into the
 
01:34:03.709 --> 01:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
numbers so I'm happy to start with that
 
01:34:03.719 --> 01:34:05.270 align:start position:0%
numbers so I'm happy to start with that
so

01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:09.229 --> 01:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
uh we are at uh two and a half Beacon
 
01:34:11.930 --> 01:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
Street where we've been since 2012.
 
01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
we're in the first year of our third
 
01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
five-year lease
 
01:34:21.229 --> 01:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
um the current rent
 
01:34:23.810 --> 01:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
for year one is a little under forty
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and then there was an
 
01:34:27.890 --> 01:34:27.900 align:start position:0%
upward adjustment for years two through
 
01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:29.689 align:start position:0%
upward adjustment for years two through
five

01:34:29.689 --> 01:34:29.699 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:34:32.209 --> 01:34:32.219 align:start position:0%
um and it's around
 
01:34:33.890 --> 01:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
actually I can get you I think I have
 
01:34:36.410 --> 01:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
the paper but it's close to 48 or 49 000
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
a year
 
01:34:41.689 --> 01:34:41.699 align:start position:0%
which I on a square foot basis
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
pushes us up to around 9 19 a square
 
01:34:50.570 --> 01:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
foot I think we're 2300 2400 square feet
 
01:34:53.930 --> 01:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
so there is a jump of approximately ten
 
01:34:58.370 --> 01:34:58.380 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year in in class 22
 
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.669 align:start position:0%
because of the
lease

01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
lease
 
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry where's Beacon Street
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
so if you just go down North State
 
01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
Street just before you hit the Rotary on
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
the heading north on the left it's it's
 
01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
the site of the Old State Prison we are
 
01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
actually in the Old State Prison
 
01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
Workshop from the 1800s so it's always a
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
fun thing to talk about
 
01:35:24.649 --> 01:35:24.659 align:start position:0%
um I have a book from the Historical
 
01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
Society with some interesting
 
01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
photographs and I always tell people
 
01:35:32.090 --> 01:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
that in our back parking lot there was a
 
01:35:36.649 --> 01:35:36.659 align:start position:0%
a hanging in 1873 so but you you know
 
01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
there was a workshop and they used to
 
01:35:40.669 --> 01:35:40.679 align:start position:0%
make bed frames and so there's a there's
 
01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
a snapshot from 1875 of a horse-drawn
 
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
cart that is just full of bed frames
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
being taken down to the
 
01:35:53.930 --> 01:35:53.940 align:start position:0%
railroad station for shipment and back
 
01:35:56.810 --> 01:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
then it was that was I think this the
 
01:35:58.910 --> 01:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
version of hard forced labor you weren't
 
01:36:01.850 --> 01:36:01.860 align:start position:0%
the inmates were not compensated and
 
01:36:04.129 --> 01:36:04.139 align:start position:0%
then around 1880 they built the new
 
01:36:06.649 --> 01:36:06.659 align:start position:0%
facility up the street so all the
 
01:36:08.810 --> 01:36:08.820 align:start position:0%
surrounding components of the state
 
01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
prison back in the 1800s I think was
 
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
primarily wooden structures and so
 
01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
that's all gone but our building is a
 
01:36:16.850 --> 01:36:16.860 align:start position:0%
brick structure
 
01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:18.070 align:start position:0%
brick structure
so

01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire followed by
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative so my my understanding is
 
01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
that the architect who designed this
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
building you're talking about did such a
 
01:36:29.930 --> 01:36:29.940 align:start position:0%
good job and brought it in under budget
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
that he was like a few years later he
 
01:36:33.649 --> 01:36:33.659 align:start position:0%
was given the contract for the state
 
01:36:36.850 --> 01:36:36.860 align:start position:0%
house so
 
01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
yes so the state house was designed by
 
01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
somebody who had had built a prison but
 
01:36:48.850 --> 01:36:48.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
more history this was also the location
 
01:36:55.610 --> 01:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
of the immediate past
 
01:36:58.490 --> 01:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
um rental site for the Democratic party
 
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:04.729 --> 01:37:04.739 align:start position:0%
and one of our one of our neighbors who
 
01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
used to teach at Bishop Brady in Concord
 
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
and has been retired for years but she's
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
lived next to this building for over 50
 
01:37:14.330 --> 01:37:14.340 align:start position:0%
years she was there when there was a car
 
01:37:17.629 --> 01:37:17.639 align:start position:0%
dealership occupying the space and if
 
01:37:17.639 --> 01:37:18.709 align:start position:0%
dealership occupying the space and if
you

01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
delve around into the building you can
 
01:37:24.110 --> 01:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
see the internal structures for a ramp
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
from Beacon Street that allowed them to
 
01:37:28.610 --> 01:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
take cars up to their Showroom on the
 
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
second floor which is where we are so
 
01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
it's had a lot of different purposes
 
01:37:35.810 --> 01:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
um I see it now
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
as because it's in the middle of a
 
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
residential area is as a potential for
 
01:37:43.010 --> 01:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
somebody to do a you know a condo type
 
01:37:45.410 --> 01:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
project or apartments but
 
01:37:47.090 --> 01:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the current landlord's
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
um so I had a couple of other specific
 
01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
comments on what the differences are
 
01:37:59.390 --> 01:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
um they're itemized on page five of the
 
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
handout under notes
 
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
one through five
 
01:38:07.370 --> 01:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
the biggest difference is that this
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
budget includes funding for legal files
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
which is software that's been used by
 
01:38:15.050 --> 01:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
the board of tax and land appeals for
 
01:38:17.450 --> 01:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
probably at least 15 years and it's
 
01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
docket management case management data
 
01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:21.310 align:start position:0%
docket management case management data
management

01:38:21.310 --> 01:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:38:24.649 --> 01:38:24.659 align:start position:0%
software we have always shied away from
 
01:38:27.290 --> 01:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
trying to get some kind of docket
 
01:38:29.169 --> 01:38:29.179 align:start position:0%
software in our budget
 
01:38:31.970 --> 01:38:31.980 align:start position:0%
just because I at the time it was more
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
expensive than it would have been a big
 
01:38:37.729 --> 01:38:37.739 align:start position:0%
ask but the costing for this
 
01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
um in Year One
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
is 17
 
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
000 and in year two is fourteen thousand
 
01:38:48.970 --> 01:38:48.980 align:start position:0%
year one is higher because
 
01:38:52.610 --> 01:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
of uh setting the system up migrating
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
data Consultants I think were listed by
 
01:38:58.850 --> 01:38:58.860 align:start position:0%
doit at ten thousand dollars
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
the actual licenses per year I think are
 
01:39:04.330 --> 01:39:04.340 align:start position:0%
around six thousand dollars so my
 
01:39:06.530 --> 01:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
impression is once we get through the
 
01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
first two years with this system the
 
01:39:11.330 --> 01:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
going forward cost will be similar to
 
01:39:14.689 --> 01:39:14.699 align:start position:0%
what those license fees are but
 
01:39:16.610 --> 01:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
having gone through some demonstrations
 
01:39:18.410 --> 01:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
with the vendor
 
01:39:21.229 --> 01:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
um and reviewed the current system with
 
01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
the board of tax and land appeals
 
01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
Representatives I can assure you that
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's a long overdue modernization of our
 
01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
current systems
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
um will allow us to
 
01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
manage our dock attract data produce
 
01:39:38.810 --> 01:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
reports far better than the way we do
 
01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
now and the current system is sort of
 
01:39:45.110 --> 01:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
we're in the Twilight Zone between old
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
filing cabinets and paper folders when I
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
started I think we had about 30
 
01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
filing cabinets up at our Manchester
 
01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
Street location
 
01:39:56.890 --> 01:39:56.900 align:start position:0%
and we've done a pretty good job
 
01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
scanning all that material so we do have
 
01:40:02.209 --> 01:40:02.219 align:start position:0%
PDFs of a lot of historical stuff but
 
01:40:02.219 --> 01:40:03.470 align:start position:0%
PDFs of a lot of historical stuff but
this

01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:40:04.850 --> 01:40:04.860 align:start position:0%
the way the system is currently
 
01:40:07.970 --> 01:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
organized is the way that makes sense to
 
01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:08.750 align:start position:0%
organized is the way that makes sense to
me

01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
so that's the weak Link in the chain I'm
 
01:40:12.770 --> 01:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
the only one who truly understands how
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
it works and there's there's so many
 
01:40:16.970 --> 01:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
moving parts to it now that sometimes
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
the question will come up about
 
01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
something and and I spent I waste a lot
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
of time trying to figure out why I did
 
01:40:24.709 --> 01:40:24.719 align:start position:0%
it the way I did and then trying to
 
01:40:27.169 --> 01:40:27.179 align:start position:0%
explain it and then a lot of times I
 
01:40:29.209 --> 01:40:29.219 align:start position:0%
recognize that what I had done was
 
01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
probably not a good idea and so we tweak
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
it so this would put all of those
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
systems into the hands of basically
 
01:40:39.050 --> 01:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
professionals who have been doing this
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
kind of thing for years
 
01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
I think it'll add a lot of stability and
 
01:40:45.470 --> 01:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
efficiency and will improve our customer
 
01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:48.169 align:start position:0%
efficiency and will improve our customer
service

01:40:48.169 --> 01:40:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:51.290 --> 01:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
so it's related to that node two there's
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
a seven thousand dollar item for Network
 
01:40:55.129 --> 01:40:55.139 align:start position:0%
equipment I'm not convinced that all of
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
that is attributable to
 
01:41:00.590 --> 01:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
um the legal files I mean we we rely on
 
01:41:03.709 --> 01:41:03.719 align:start position:0%
doit to manage our our Network closet
 
01:41:05.330 --> 01:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
and periodically
 
01:41:08.209 --> 01:41:08.219 align:start position:0%
we have to buy a new Switch which I
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
think the last time we did that was a
 
01:41:12.530 --> 01:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
two or three thousand dollar expense and
 
01:41:15.050 --> 01:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:41:17.149 --> 01:41:17.159 align:start position:0%
and that's so that's a one-time expense
 
01:41:19.129 --> 01:41:19.139 align:start position:0%
and then we have also references in
 
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
there to PCS and laptops those are again
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
on schedules recommended by doit Note 3
 
01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
jumping to class 49 so for the last year
 
01:41:33.010 --> 01:41:33.020 align:start position:0%
we've been participating in a program
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
developed by division of personnel the
 
01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
human resources support unit
 
01:41:41.629 --> 01:41:41.639 align:start position:0%
I think I think Department of Labor also
 
01:41:44.169 --> 01:41:44.179 align:start position:0%
participates in it but
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's designed to provide HR Support just
 
01:41:51.950 --> 01:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
to um smaller agencies and Boards
 
01:41:53.450 --> 01:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
although I don't consider Department of
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
Labor to be obviously at our scale that
 
01:41:58.250 --> 01:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
don't have the in-house staff that have
 
01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
the expertise because what happens is
 
01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
anytime you have an HR issue you have to
 
01:42:04.729 --> 01:42:04.739 align:start position:0%
deal with it might take a staff person a
 
01:42:04.739 --> 01:42:05.810 align:start position:0%
deal with it might take a staff person a
week

01:42:05.810 --> 01:42:05.820 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:42:08.330 --> 01:42:08.340 align:start position:0%
to to figure out what to do and then to
 
01:42:10.370 --> 01:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
find the people over in division of
 
01:42:12.830 --> 01:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
personnel to get the job done and nobody
 
01:42:15.050 --> 01:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
really owns the particular issue that
 
01:42:16.370 --> 01:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed so it's a great
 
01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:17.510 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed so it's a great
program

01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh the annual fee for each year is
 
01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
around four thousand dollars they bill
 
01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:24.530 align:start position:0%
around four thousand dollars they bill
quarterly

01:42:24.530 --> 01:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
quarterly
 
01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:25.370 align:start position:0%
quarterly
um

01:42:25.370 --> 01:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
and since we've been doing it this year
 
01:42:32.270 --> 01:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
I feel we have a much better uh
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
connection whenever we have a need for
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
assistance from them and they also
 
01:42:38.810 --> 01:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
contact us as necessary to make sure
 
01:42:41.570 --> 01:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
we're aware of relevant things
 
01:42:43.850 --> 01:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
Note 4
 
01:42:43.860 --> 01:42:44.990 align:start position:0%
Note 4
um

01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:47.450 --> 01:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
I included a one-time expense of seven
 
01:42:50.090 --> 01:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to replace hearing room
 
01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh tables
 
01:42:55.370 --> 01:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
and some partitions that I had picked up
 
01:42:59.689 --> 01:42:59.699 align:start position:0%
at White Farm the partitions were were
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
badly used and are now pretty much
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
unstable at the connections and the
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
hearing room tables are
 
01:43:08.570 --> 01:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
probably almost as heavy as these a
 
01:43:11.209 --> 01:43:11.219 align:start position:0%
little more mobile and depending on what
 
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
the activity is in the hearing room I
 
01:43:14.689 --> 01:43:14.699 align:start position:0%
push the tables around
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
so I did a little research when we were
 
01:43:19.010 --> 01:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
doing the budget to find out what it
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
would cost to get tables that maybe
 
01:43:23.209 --> 01:43:23.219 align:start position:0%
weren't as as bulky and and were more
 
01:43:23.219 --> 01:43:25.189 align:start position:0%
weren't as as bulky and and were more
portable

01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
portable
 
01:43:27.770 --> 01:43:27.780 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know what's out there now
 
01:43:29.810 --> 01:43:29.820 align:start position:0%
but that was that's the purpose of this
 
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
one-time expense
 
01:43:34.250 --> 01:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
uh Note 5 is just an overall high level
 
01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh notation of what the increase versus
 
01:43:41.209 --> 01:43:41.219 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 adjusted authorized is so
 
01:43:44.510 --> 01:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:46.209 --> 01:43:46.219 align:start position:0%
um 21
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
565 over fiscal year 23 and then 13
 
01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
000 and fiscal year 25 over fiscal year
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's all I have
 
01:44:03.050 --> 01:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for the
 
01:44:03.060 --> 01:44:04.970 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for the
chair

01:44:04.970 --> 01:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:44:07.490 --> 01:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
of the board all right representative
 
01:44:10.570 --> 01:44:10.580 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you is the legislature
 
01:44:13.689 --> 01:44:13.699 align:start position:0%
employees are they a bargaining unit no
 
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
I think there's a bill pending and I
 
01:44:18.530 --> 01:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
think a bill has been filed
 
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
fairly regularly to allow them to
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
organize but I don't know what the
 
01:44:25.490 --> 01:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
status of the current bill is oh so
 
01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:26.820 align:start position:0%
they're they're on
 
01:44:29.570 --> 01:44:29.580 align:start position:0%
they're not unionized they don't they're
 
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
not their numbers currently they're not
 
01:44:32.930 --> 01:44:32.940 align:start position:0%
allowed to organize under emergency
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and so so the follow-up
 
01:44:36.830 --> 01:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
should should a similar status be in
 
01:44:43.129 --> 01:44:43.139 align:start position:0%
your for employees is there some any
 
01:44:45.770 --> 01:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
kind of we're not right we're not part
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
of any bargaining unit yeah oh because
 
01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
it's listed as classified so that's
 
01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
right well we're there are classified
 
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
employees in the state who are not
 
01:44:56.209 --> 01:44:56.219 align:start position:0%
covered by any bargaining unit so every
 
01:44:58.729 --> 01:44:58.739 align:start position:0%
oh I see yeah so every bargaining unit
 
01:45:00.890 --> 01:45:00.900 align:start position:0%
will reference the department that the
 
01:45:02.689 --> 01:45:02.699 align:start position:0%
employees work in
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
so there will be a bargaining unit for
 
01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:06.410 align:start position:0%
so there will be a bargaining unit for
doit

01:45:06.410 --> 01:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
doit
 
01:45:08.810 --> 01:45:08.820 align:start position:0%
um classified employees for Corrections
 
01:45:10.729 --> 01:45:10.739 align:start position:0%
classified employees and and some of the
 
01:45:12.169 --> 01:45:12.179 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit descriptions at the
 
01:45:14.209 --> 01:45:14.219 align:start position:0%
state level are are much more detailed
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
and specific like the Troopers
 
01:45:19.129 --> 01:45:19.139 align:start position:0%
and the Troopers Command Staff and yeah
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
I always just read classified as a
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
member of the Union but that's not
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
really right it's it's just more of
 
01:45:27.609 --> 01:45:27.619 align:start position:0%
hourly and overtime kind of thing versus
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
I think it just boils down to are you in
 
01:45:32.570 --> 01:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
the are you a classified or an
 
01:45:35.149 --> 01:45:35.159 align:start position:0%
unclassified employee and then how the
 
01:45:37.129 --> 01:45:37.139 align:start position:0%
you know how the state thank you yes
 
01:45:37.139 --> 01:45:39.290 align:start position:0%
you know how the state thank you yes
yeah

01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:45:41.330 --> 01:45:41.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just a quick question
 
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
on the uh
 
01:45:45.250 --> 01:45:45.260 align:start position:0%
on the class 10
 
01:45:50.270 --> 01:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh can you explain the jump to 293 in
 
01:45:52.729 --> 01:45:52.739 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2023 and then it goes back
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
down again to 266. uh under the
 
01:45:58.609 --> 01:45:58.619 align:start position:0%
recommended in 2024
 
01:45:58.619 --> 01:46:01.070 align:start position:0%
recommended in 2024
so

01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I haven't actually researched that
 
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
but uh the here's the current status we
 
01:46:07.490 --> 01:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
have one position that's vacant as we
 
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
had an employee retire about a year and
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
a half ago uh and we reclassified
 
01:46:16.189 --> 01:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
a position
 
01:46:16.199 --> 01:46:16.850 align:start position:0%
a position
um

01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:16.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:18.590 --> 01:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
I mean to make a long story short short
 
01:46:21.169 --> 01:46:21.179 align:start position:0%
we were classified a position as a legal
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
secretary for
 
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
which is was a jump of like two or three
 
01:46:28.129 --> 01:46:28.139 align:start position:0%
labor grades
 
01:46:28.139 --> 01:46:28.790 align:start position:0%
labor grades
um

01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:32.090 --> 01:46:32.100 align:start position:0%
so so that would be part of
 
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
well of course that I think that
 
01:46:36.109 --> 01:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
happened during this biennium
 
01:46:36.119 --> 01:46:37.910 align:start position:0%
happened during this biennium
um

01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
but I think the funding and we get these
 
01:46:43.609 --> 01:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
numbers from I mean we don't plug in
 
01:46:45.709 --> 01:46:45.719 align:start position:0%
these numbers I think the funding for 24
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
and 25 is based on the vacant position
 
01:46:52.669 --> 01:46:52.679 align:start position:0%
coming in at the lowest grade and step
 
01:46:52.679 --> 01:46:55.850 align:start position:0%
coming in at the lowest grade and step
but

01:46:55.850 --> 01:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:58.750 --> 01:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that equates to the
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
third almost thirty thousand dollar
 
01:47:03.109 --> 01:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
difference but that's would be part of
 
01:47:04.850 --> 01:47:04.860 align:start position:0%
it yeah
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
otherwise there's I mean everything
 
01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
everybody has just been I mean most of
 
01:47:12.169 --> 01:47:12.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
um well
 
01:47:17.450 --> 01:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
almost 15 years and everybody is at the
 
01:47:19.129 --> 01:47:19.139 align:start position:0%
top of their pay scale and there's
 
01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:28.189 --> 01:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
any further questions I do have one so
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
on page four it shows the number of
 
01:47:33.590 --> 01:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
bargaining units that you I guess
 
01:47:36.410 --> 01:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
oversee is 660.
 
01:47:39.169 --> 01:47:39.179 align:start position:0%
how many are you like involved in right
 
01:47:44.930 --> 01:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:47.450 --> 01:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
so we actually do not have an active
 
01:47:50.450 --> 01:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
role in negotiations except when there
 
01:47:51.790 --> 01:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
are informal
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
requests for guidance and advice and
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
even then we can't provide
 
01:47:59.450 --> 01:47:59.460 align:start position:0%
representation we can just go over basic
 
01:48:02.270 --> 01:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
concepts and obligations
 
01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:03.530 align:start position:0%
concepts and obligations
um

01:48:03.530 --> 01:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
when we get involved in negotiations
 
01:48:07.370 --> 01:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
it's because an unfair Labor practice
 
01:48:10.910 --> 01:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
charge has been filed so two
 
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
time goes by but around two years ago in
 
01:48:16.010 --> 01:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
connection with negotiations on the
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
current sea contract there were a number
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
of ulps filed by different unions
 
01:48:24.169 --> 01:48:24.179 align:start position:0%
complaining about the bargaining process
 
01:48:25.970 --> 01:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
with the state
 
01:48:28.189 --> 01:48:28.199 align:start position:0%
and we issued a number of
 
01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
decisions relating to that but that's
 
01:48:34.010 --> 01:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
how we get involved we don't actually go
 
01:48:36.350 --> 01:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
out to the workplace and meet with the
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
people at the table to facilitate the
 
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
negotiations it's up to the
 
01:48:43.129 --> 01:48:43.139 align:start position:0%
bargain the respective bargaining teams
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
to do that most of them are pretty
 
01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
experienced and familiar with the
 
01:48:48.830 --> 01:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
process it doesn't mean they're going to
 
01:48:50.810 --> 01:48:50.820 align:start position:0%
get a contract done but they understand
 
01:48:52.729 --> 01:48:52.739 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:48:54.890 --> 01:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
I was just curious like how many balls
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
are in the air with your board right now
 
01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
like how many people are before you is
 
01:49:03.669 --> 01:49:03.679 align:start position:0%
with a complaint or
 
01:49:06.890 --> 01:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
asking for your assistance yeah well we
 
01:49:09.229 --> 01:49:09.239 align:start position:0%
have an active we have an active docket
 
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
we we are getting about 100 cases a year
 
01:49:13.850 --> 01:49:13.860 align:start position:0%
in okay that's what I was looking yeah
 
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
so but those cases I mean they only deal
 
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
with negotiations when the underlying
 
01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
dispute is over whether one side or the
 
01:49:23.570 --> 01:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
other has has reached their bargaining
 
01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:25.490 align:start position:0%
other has has reached their bargaining
obligation

01:49:25.490 --> 01:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
all right well seeing no further
 
01:49:30.229 --> 01:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
questions does the division okay with
 
01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
checking this off
 
01:49:35.470 --> 01:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you very much
 
01:49:38.270 --> 01:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time
 
01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:39.609 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time
foreign

01:49:39.609 --> 01:49:39.619 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:49:43.370 --> 01:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
so we're off until one o'clock the uh as
 
01:49:45.229 --> 01:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
I mentioned maybe earlier the Department
 
01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
of Natural and cultural resources their
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner is ill so they've asked to
 
01:49:52.910 --> 01:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
be continued to another day so we'll
 
01:49:54.229 --> 01:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
work on some
 
01:49:57.169 --> 01:49:57.179 align:start position:0%
of our bills and other miscellaneous
 
01:50:00.410 --> 01:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
stuff for that hour after one
 
01:50:04.490 --> 01:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
and I do have a question for Mr Hoffman
 
01:50:07.729 --> 01:50:07.739 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposed pay raises for
 
01:50:10.209 --> 01:50:10.219 align:start position:0%
all state employees right classified
 
01:50:13.070 --> 01:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
non-classify everybody is there a
 
01:50:14.570 --> 01:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
breakout of
 
01:50:16.970 --> 01:50:16.980 align:start position:0%
the amount for classified and
 
01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:30.410 align:start position:0%
the amount for classified and
non-classified

01:50:30.410 --> 01:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:32.689 --> 01:50:32.699 align:start position:0%
would that be a difficult number to get
 
01:50:35.870 --> 01:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
from Das or someone to
 
01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:45.890 --> 01:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
because if you recall there was some
 
01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
discussion before a full committee as
 
01:50:51.709 --> 01:50:51.719 align:start position:0%
far as if there was changes you know it
 
01:50:54.109 --> 01:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
would be an issue for labor I was just
 
01:50:55.850 --> 01:50:55.860 align:start position:0%
curious on how we could break that out
 
01:50:59.149 --> 01:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's a big number 100 million
 
01:51:01.790 --> 01:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
dollars so I just kind of curious if we
 
01:51:03.229 --> 01:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
could break that out representative
 
01:51:03.239 --> 01:51:04.450 align:start position:0%
could break that out representative
Schultz

01:51:04.450 --> 01:51:04.460 align:start position:0%
Schultz
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
and I to follow up on representative
 
01:51:09.290 --> 01:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
McGuire's question that connects to this
 
01:51:10.810 --> 01:51:10.820 align:start position:0%
to some degree
 
01:51:13.609 --> 01:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
classified and unclassified positions
 
01:51:16.250 --> 01:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
benefit typically from correct me if I'm
 
01:51:16.260 --> 01:51:17.450 align:start position:0%
benefit typically from correct me if I'm
wrong

01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
um Union negotiations and then
 
01:51:21.530 --> 01:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
implemented contracts because those
 
01:51:25.370 --> 01:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
raises typically apply to all state
 
01:51:27.590 --> 01:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
employees to some degree and the
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
legislative staff benefit from contract
 
01:51:31.199 --> 01:51:32.629 align:start position:0%
legislative staff benefit from contract
negotiations

01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
01:51:34.729 --> 01:51:34.739 align:start position:0%
and that small
 
01:51:37.250 --> 01:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
scale in terms of some of the benefits
 
01:51:40.729 --> 01:51:40.739 align:start position:0%
and definitely pay increases and by the
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
way the bill that was referenced was
 
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
Renny Cushing's built for many years and
 
01:51:48.350 --> 01:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
now it's my bill so
 
01:51:51.770 --> 01:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
um it is in admin Services
 
01:51:56.810 --> 01:51:56.820 align:start position:0%
um I believe uh if has no recommendation
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:04.189 --> 01:52:04.199 align:start position:0%
no it goes to legislative administration
 
01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:08.639 align:start position:0%
because it's just legislative staff and
 
01:52:08.639 --> 01:52:09.410 align:start position:0%
because it's just legislative staff and
um

01:52:09.410 --> 01:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
in recent years some legislatures have
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
unionized their staff so at least it now
 
01:52:17.810 --> 01:52:17.820 align:start position:0%
has a precedent in other states and the
 
01:52:21.169 --> 01:52:21.179 align:start position:0%
I believe Congress has also because the
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
same laws that apply to State
 
01:52:24.590 --> 01:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
Legislative staff applied to
 
01:52:27.709 --> 01:52:27.719 align:start position:0%
Congressional staff I believe the U.S
 
01:52:29.330 --> 01:52:29.340 align:start position:0%
house also is heading in that direction
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
at least they were I don't know the
 
01:52:33.729 --> 01:52:33.739 align:start position:0%
status of that
 
01:52:36.290 --> 01:52:36.300 align:start position:0%
uh you know I should know the answer to
 
01:52:39.770 --> 01:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:53.210 --> 03:12:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:56.330 --> 03:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm based on Mike Kane's
 
03:12:59.929 --> 03:12:59.939 align:start position:0%
suggestion I've asked um LBA for a
 
03:13:02.570 --> 03:13:02.580 align:start position:0%
slightly improved amendment that would
 
03:13:05.530 --> 03:13:05.540 align:start position:0%
move those numbers into fiscal year 23
 
03:13:09.790 --> 03:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
rather than uh 24
 
03:13:12.830 --> 03:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
just because currently on paper we have
 
03:13:17.510 --> 03:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
more in 23 than we do in 24. so
 
03:13:21.349 --> 03:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
and that that's technically a good idea
 
03:13:24.110 --> 03:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
because it's before the full committee
 
03:13:26.990 --> 03:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
in a week or so and it's traveling
 
03:13:29.510 --> 03:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
independent of House Bill too so it
 
03:13:32.090 --> 03:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
would actually take effect if it goes
 
03:13:33.769 --> 03:13:33.779 align:start position:0%
over to the senate in its present form
 
03:13:37.969 --> 03:13:37.979 align:start position:0%
in 2023 I believe oh I see yeah it
 
03:13:39.710 --> 03:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't in House Bill too since it was a
 
03:13:43.670 --> 03:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
house bill by itself a standalone but
 
03:13:47.030 --> 03:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
but it's 50 million dollars again all in
 
03:13:49.370 --> 03:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
one shot
 
03:13:53.030 --> 03:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah which is I I love the idea but
 
03:13:55.030 --> 03:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering
 
03:13:58.969 --> 03:13:58.979 align:start position:0%
that affects the lapse of
 
03:14:01.730 --> 03:14:01.740 align:start position:0%
of 23 right
 
03:14:04.550 --> 03:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
but it would yeah it would yeah it would
 
03:14:08.210 --> 03:14:08.220 align:start position:0%
yeah and and we may need that I mean we
 
03:14:10.790 --> 03:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
may need that but through the budget
 
03:14:13.670 --> 03:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
right but this is the but I mean all
 
03:14:15.889 --> 03:14:15.899 align:start position:0%
these things on the paper are the budget
 
03:14:20.570 --> 03:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:22.370 --> 03:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
at my point
 
03:14:26.929 --> 03:14:26.939 align:start position:0%
out of the revenue of 24 and 25 is what
 
03:14:29.750 --> 03:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
lapses from 23.
 
03:14:33.050 --> 03:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
yes so if if you pass a bill it's
 
03:14:36.410 --> 03:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
effective in 23 to take 50 million and
 
03:14:38.870 --> 03:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
put it into the pension fund which I
 
03:14:41.809 --> 03:14:41.819 align:start position:0%
think is a great idea except for the
 
03:14:45.230 --> 03:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
fact that you reduce the lapse which we
 
03:14:48.290 --> 03:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
probably need for 24 and 25.
 
03:14:51.530 --> 03:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman do you have the the numbers
 
03:14:55.550 --> 03:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
the most recent numbers on
 
03:14:58.130 --> 03:14:58.140 align:start position:0%
I know that the governor proposed
 
03:15:01.849 --> 03:15:01.859 align:start position:0%
something like 185 million dollars that
 
03:15:05.750 --> 03:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
would be left in the rainy day fund
 
03:15:08.690 --> 03:15:08.700 align:start position:0%
if everything that he had as specials
 
03:15:08.700 --> 03:15:10.070 align:start position:0%
if everything that he had as specials
passed

03:15:10.070 --> 03:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
passed
 
03:15:13.429 --> 03:15:13.439 align:start position:0%
something like that right the I got I
 
03:15:15.530 --> 03:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
got an email from Mike Kane about this
 
03:15:17.990 --> 03:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
detail and
 
03:15:20.570 --> 03:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
um apparently if you took everything on
 
03:15:23.090 --> 03:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
this paper right yeah there's nothing
 
03:15:26.269 --> 03:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
left almost all the bills and all the
 
03:15:27.889 --> 03:15:27.899 align:start position:0%
house bill too
 
03:15:31.910 --> 03:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
minus what ways of means gave us
 
03:15:36.830 --> 03:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
we have to cut up only about 130 million
 
03:15:40.429 --> 03:15:40.439 align:start position:0%
from the whole budget okay so either by
 
03:15:43.309 --> 03:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
not passing some of the bill stuff or by
 
03:15:45.110 --> 03:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
taking some of the House Bill 2 stuff
 
03:15:47.630 --> 03:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
away now we've added a few here and
 
03:15:50.870 --> 03:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
there type things right so that adds to
 
03:15:52.730 --> 03:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
that hundred and thirty million in some
 
03:15:55.130 --> 03:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
sense but we've also added some more
 
03:15:58.910 --> 03:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue too so that subtracts right so
 
03:15:58.920 --> 03:16:00.650 align:start position:0%
Revenue too so that subtracts right so
um

03:16:00.650 --> 03:16:00.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:03.530 --> 03:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
that that's my understanding is that
 
03:16:05.510 --> 03:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
what you think well the latest letter
 
03:16:05.520 --> 03:16:13.910 align:start position:0%
what you think well the latest letter
yeah

03:16:13.910 --> 03:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:13.920 --> 03:16:19.510 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:16:19.510 --> 03:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:23.510 --> 03:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
exactly exactly and and that's assuming
 
03:16:25.550 --> 03:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
you want to leave the rainy day fund
 
03:16:28.370 --> 03:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
where it is right now at 160 or
 
03:16:29.769 --> 03:16:29.779 align:start position:0%
something yeah
 
03:16:32.210 --> 03:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
I think it's a 180 something but
 
03:16:34.070 --> 03:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever it is if you don't
 
03:16:36.290 --> 03:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
want to if you want to be neutral as far
 
03:16:38.030 --> 03:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
as the rainy day fund if you want to add
 
03:16:39.830 --> 03:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
more to the rainy day fund then you have
 
03:16:41.210 --> 03:16:41.220 align:start position:0%
to cut more
 
03:16:43.969 --> 03:16:43.979 align:start position:0%
somewhere else right so
 
03:16:47.269 --> 03:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
um okay yeah but does that take into the
 
03:16:50.450 --> 03:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
labs does that take into effect yeah so
 
03:16:54.170 --> 03:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
that's everything the lapse the uh the
 
03:16:58.070 --> 03:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
revenue from because the the lapse is in
 
03:17:02.630 --> 03:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
um HR 17. it has a 2023 Cal column right
 
03:17:06.349 --> 03:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
so if you take all the bills plus House
 
03:17:10.370 --> 03:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
Bill one plus House Bill 2 minus
 
03:17:12.710 --> 03:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means
 
03:17:16.969 --> 03:17:16.979 align:start position:0%
it's you've got 130 too much right
 
03:17:20.090 --> 03:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
you've got to find another 130. well
 
03:17:22.309 --> 03:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
it's representative Griffin's correct
 
03:17:24.410 --> 03:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
though that we really won't know the
 
03:17:26.870 --> 03:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
lapse until June
 
03:17:28.570 --> 03:17:28.580 align:start position:0%
and that's right
 
03:17:30.889 --> 03:17:30.899 align:start position:0%
you know what they thought they'd be
 
03:17:33.830 --> 03:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
returning since they have 26 vacant
 
03:17:36.290 --> 03:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
generally funded positions and she said
 
03:17:39.889 --> 03:17:39.899 align:start position:0%
she didn't no okay I was close
 
03:17:42.710 --> 03:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
that that's that's what I fear I fear
 
03:17:42.720 --> 03:17:43.790 align:start position:0%
that that's that's what I fear I fear
that

03:17:43.790 --> 03:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
we've had a number of people come in
 
03:17:45.840 --> 03:17:46.790 align:start position:0%
we've had a number of people come in
here

03:17:46.790 --> 03:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:17:51.170 --> 03:17:51.180 align:start position:0%
that had vacant positions two years ago
 
03:17:53.570 --> 03:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
that they couldn't find anybody
 
03:17:56.330 --> 03:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
but they filled them in the interim and
 
03:17:59.210 --> 03:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
mostly in 23 they said
 
03:18:03.349 --> 03:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
so I I my fear is that Labs would fall
 
03:18:07.250 --> 03:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:09.230 --> 03:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:18:11.750 --> 03:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
so back yes represents oh
 
03:18:13.910 --> 03:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
representational I was just going to add
 
03:18:17.269 --> 03:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
that in general with State hiring there
 
03:18:20.330 --> 03:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
still is a need for a lot more personnel
 
03:18:23.450 --> 03:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
in multiple categories of work obviously
 
03:18:26.809 --> 03:18:26.819 align:start position:0%
some are better than others but um it's
 
03:18:28.730 --> 03:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
still we were we will still have a
 
03:18:32.450 --> 03:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
continuing hiring difficulty for many
 
03:18:38.650 --> 03:18:38.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:41.330 --> 03:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
so one thing that you may not be aware
 
03:18:44.630 --> 03:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
of is we build some of that into the
 
03:18:46.570 --> 03:18:46.580 align:start position:0%
budget right
 
03:18:50.090 --> 03:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
anticipated lab so we figure maybe five
 
03:18:53.150 --> 03:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
percent or something of what agencies
 
03:18:55.070 --> 03:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
are given they won't be able to spend
 
03:18:58.790 --> 03:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
and so therefore we actually budget five
 
03:19:00.769 --> 03:19:00.779 align:start position:0%
percent more than what ways of means
 
03:19:02.750 --> 03:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
tells us we're going to have right so
 
03:19:02.760 --> 03:19:04.490 align:start position:0%
tells us we're going to have right so
yeah

03:19:04.490 --> 03:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:19:04.500 --> 03:19:06.530 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

03:19:06.530 --> 03:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:19:09.050 --> 03:19:09.060 align:start position:0%
so maybe for now I'll leave House Bill
 
03:19:13.429 --> 03:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:15.650 --> 03:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean okay
 
03:19:18.710 --> 03:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
again we're looking for 130 together
 
03:19:21.530 --> 03:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
with the other divisions I think so you
 
03:19:23.630 --> 03:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
know anyway
 
03:19:27.050 --> 03:19:27.060 align:start position:0%
so next we have uh House Bill 74 that
 
03:19:29.929 --> 03:19:29.939 align:start position:0%
was uh relative to the employees unused
 
03:19:32.210 --> 03:19:32.220 align:start position:0%
during time and that was itl five to
 
03:19:36.230 --> 03:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:39.790 --> 03:19:39.800 align:start position:0%
then we go down to house bill
 
03:19:43.250 --> 03:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
212 that was the funding investigation
 
03:19:47.389 --> 03:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
testing monitoring for pfaffs
 
03:19:47.399 --> 03:19:49.250 align:start position:0%
testing monitoring for pfaffs
so

03:19:49.250 --> 03:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:19:52.309 --> 03:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
how much money was that mister was it
 
03:19:54.889 --> 03:19:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:59.630 --> 03:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:59.640 --> 03:20:04.849 align:start position:0%
 
212.

03:20:04.849 --> 03:20:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:08.510 --> 03:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
yeah two million dollars and 23 yes
 
03:20:10.250 --> 03:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:20:12.469 --> 03:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
so we have not made a decision on that
 
03:20:15.410 --> 03:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
are we up for making a decision on the
 
03:20:18.910 --> 03:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
two million dollars for p fast
 
03:20:42.670 --> 03:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:46.490 --> 03:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know that
 
03:21:02.090 --> 03:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:04.849 --> 03:21:04.859 align:start position:0%
if my memory serves me right too I think
 
03:21:08.450 --> 03:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
Des appeared to have funding and a
 
03:21:10.550 --> 03:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
little under control and
 
03:21:13.450 --> 03:21:13.460 align:start position:0%
they've been deep into it
 
03:21:16.490 --> 03:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry we supposed to be we've been
 
03:21:19.130 --> 03:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
recorded for this so yeah okay so my
 
03:21:20.990 --> 03:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
apology story just I I was just trying
 
03:21:23.210 --> 03:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
to remember so they have 22 million
 
03:21:26.150 --> 03:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
dollars give or take in this pfas Loan
 
03:21:28.309 --> 03:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
Fund and then they had six million
 
03:21:30.590 --> 03:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
dollars for research which they had
 
03:21:35.630 --> 03:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
spent and so this 2 million would that 2
 
03:21:37.910 --> 03:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
million was going to be used in a way
 
03:21:40.610 --> 03:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
that the 6 million was going to be used
 
03:21:43.969 --> 03:21:43.979 align:start position:0%
if I remember right and they felt like
 
03:21:48.889 --> 03:21:48.899 align:start position:0%
the pfas Loan Fund was really for loans
 
03:21:52.190 --> 03:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
and that they couldn't use that money in
 
03:21:54.230 --> 03:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
this way I think but the only other
 
03:21:55.910 --> 03:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
thing I want to say about this bill is
 
03:21:58.730 --> 03:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
this was also a bill that was changing
 
03:22:02.269 --> 03:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
the name of the fund and so even if we
 
03:22:03.889 --> 03:22:03.899 align:start position:0%
remember I asked him even if we didn't
 
03:22:06.769 --> 03:22:06.779 align:start position:0%
appropriate the money should we still
 
03:22:10.309 --> 03:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
include some of this language in hb2 and
 
03:22:13.610 --> 03:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
they said yes yes I totally agree you
 
03:22:16.849 --> 03:22:16.859 align:start position:0%
just said so for me I was left with you
 
03:22:19.250 --> 03:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
let them keep the language for them
 
03:22:22.550 --> 03:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
changing the names of the fund but uh
 
03:22:23.929 --> 03:22:23.939 align:start position:0%
and they did say that they were going to
 
03:22:26.809 --> 03:22:26.819 align:start position:0%
use up the rest of the 6 million before
 
03:22:29.150 --> 03:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
that runs out before it lapses and in
 
03:22:31.510 --> 03:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
June but
 
03:22:33.530 --> 03:22:33.540 align:start position:0%
I don't think they need to spend another
 
03:22:35.870 --> 03:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
2 million for testing if there was
 
03:22:37.130 --> 03:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
something we needed to cut out of the
 
03:22:38.929 --> 03:22:38.939 align:start position:0%
budget I think to me this is a low
 
03:22:41.330 --> 03:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
hanging fruit
 
03:22:43.370 --> 03:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
all right represents Sweeney thank you
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
yeah from their testimony on it it did
 
03:22:49.070 --> 03:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
seem that they were under the impression
 
03:22:52.370 --> 03:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
the original 22 million was alone but
 
03:22:53.330 --> 03:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
there wasn't there's nothing that
 
03:22:54.950 --> 03:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
actually spells it out that they have to
 
03:22:58.070 --> 03:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
so can we maybe cut the spending from
 
03:23:00.110 --> 03:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
this and add in a section that clarifies
 
03:23:03.950 --> 03:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
they can use the existing appropriation
 
03:23:07.250 --> 03:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
as a response loan however they see fit
 
03:23:09.950 --> 03:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
to combat the issue I was just going to
 
03:23:11.929 --> 03:23:11.939 align:start position:0%
say they're coming in at two so we could
 
03:23:13.910 --> 03:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
ask about but I had this same question
 
03:23:16.490 --> 03:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
because I mean I didn't go back and look
 
03:23:18.349 --> 03:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
at the statutory language for the
 
03:23:21.050 --> 03:23:21.060 align:start position:0%
original right um
 
03:23:25.070 --> 03:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund creation well in general I
 
03:23:27.229 --> 03:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
believe that funded was borrowed right
 
03:23:31.610 --> 03:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
it was so we really don't like to pay
 
03:23:34.490 --> 03:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
operating expenses with borrowed money
 
03:23:38.269 --> 03:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
so that's the problem you know we it's
 
03:23:40.490 --> 03:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
okay to loan it you borrow it you loan
 
03:23:41.990 --> 03:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
it to somebody else they pay you back
 
03:23:44.690 --> 03:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
you pay it back you know that's we do
 
03:23:46.490 --> 03:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
that a fair amount I'd still like to
 
03:23:48.229 --> 03:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
look at what the language is that
 
03:23:51.650 --> 03:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
created it because I mean I do think
 
03:23:53.630 --> 03:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
there's some more work that needs to be
 
03:23:56.510 --> 03:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
done to nail down the things I was
 
03:23:58.910 --> 03:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
second looking at the language because
 
03:24:01.570 --> 03:24:01.580 align:start position:0%
I thought he I thought they were
 
03:24:04.309 --> 03:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
relatively uncertain about
 
03:24:09.050 --> 03:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:17.870 --> 03:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:20.929 --> 03:24:20.939 align:start position:0%
all right well you're doing that
 
03:24:23.150 --> 03:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
we go to
 
03:24:25.429 --> 03:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
2 30 that was the agricultural
 
03:24:28.670 --> 03:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
electronic data processing system
 
03:24:30.830 --> 03:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
that was 400
 
03:24:30.840 --> 03:24:31.910 align:start position:0%
that was 400
000.

03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
000.
 
03:24:33.769 --> 03:24:33.779 align:start position:0%
it was kind of up in the air I think we
 
03:24:35.690 --> 03:24:35.700 align:start position:0%
were pretty supportive but I didn't put
 
03:24:38.030 --> 03:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
a check mark So it seems to me that
 
03:24:40.610 --> 03:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
should be high on that list okay I'm
 
03:24:43.010 --> 03:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
sorry which one was that that was house
 
03:24:46.550 --> 03:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
bill 230. it was four hundred thousand
 
03:24:49.190 --> 03:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
it was for Agri agriculture yeah it's
 
03:24:52.550 --> 03:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
when we met with commissioner
 
03:24:54.710 --> 03:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
it sounded like they had Staffing
 
03:24:57.050 --> 03:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
problems too so if they had decent
 
03:25:02.269 --> 03:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:02.279 --> 03:25:04.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:25:04.070 --> 03:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:25:06.050 --> 03:25:06.060 align:start position:0%
just doing all these cross references
 
03:25:08.450 --> 03:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
here is we just approve it
 
03:25:08.460 --> 03:25:10.389 align:start position:0%
here is we just approve it
yeah

03:25:10.389 --> 03:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:25:13.370 --> 03:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
all right Mr Hoffman will
 
03:25:17.150 --> 03:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
approve that so it's clear the 400 000
 
03:25:19.670 --> 03:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
for the Department of agriculture's
 
03:25:23.090 --> 03:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
house bill 230.
 
03:25:24.889 --> 03:25:24.899 align:start position:0%
you know we did not vote you know in
 
03:25:27.349 --> 03:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
that so then we have uh somebody needs
 
03:25:30.349 --> 03:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:30.359 --> 03:25:31.990 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:25:31.990 --> 03:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:25:45.950 --> 03:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:48.190 --> 03:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
no no she volunteered Bill
 
03:25:50.630 --> 03:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative hatch was a clerk before
 
03:25:50.640 --> 03:25:53.470 align:start position:0%
representative hatch was a clerk before
yeah

03:25:53.470 --> 03:25:53.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:25:53.480 --> 03:26:00.110 align:start position:0%
yeah
[Laughter]

03:26:00.110 --> 03:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:02.510 --> 03:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
she's way too confident that's why she
 
03:26:06.170 --> 03:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
was chosen okay Miss Mr Mr chair could
 
03:26:08.030 --> 03:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
you give me the bill number again the
 
03:26:12.290 --> 03:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
house bill 230 230 and the motion was
 
03:26:16.250 --> 03:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and it was made by uh
 
03:26:20.389 --> 03:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
moved by Hewitt wait a minute is this
 
03:26:22.309 --> 03:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
lot to pass or is this include in the
 
03:26:23.929 --> 03:26:23.939 align:start position:0%
budget because I think we've already
 
03:26:26.450 --> 03:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
decided yeah yeah so how does that work
 
03:26:28.969 --> 03:26:28.979 align:start position:0%
yeah and included in the budget well so
 
03:26:34.389 --> 03:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:38.690 --> 03:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
well it was actually a Ford 2024.
 
03:26:41.090 --> 03:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
if you look at the sheet here so it
 
03:26:43.849 --> 03:26:43.859 align:start position:0%
wasn't for it's been moved already to uh
 
03:26:46.849 --> 03:26:46.859 align:start position:0%
2024 it was intended to be for the next
 
03:26:49.490 --> 03:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
budget cycle so it would be just to
 
03:26:51.769 --> 03:26:51.779 align:start position:0%
include the four hundred thousand
 
03:26:53.389 --> 03:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
so maybe we don't need a boat just a
 
03:26:55.610 --> 03:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
straw well we can just do a show hand
 
03:26:57.650 --> 03:26:57.660 align:start position:0%
some indication that we're okay with it
 
03:27:02.750 --> 03:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:09.889 --> 03:27:09.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:15.050 --> 03:27:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:17.510 --> 03:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
did you get all the previous bills
 
03:27:22.790 --> 03:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:24.710 --> 03:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
well they they're they're very good too
 
03:27:26.450 --> 03:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
but we have to keep track for ourselves
 
03:27:29.809 --> 03:27:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:32.389 --> 03:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
hold okay and
 
03:27:34.490 --> 03:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
all right I mean I didn't do a sheet
 
03:27:38.090 --> 03:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
sorry guys I was asleep so then we have
 
03:27:38.100 --> 03:27:41.510 align:start position:0%
sorry guys I was asleep so then we have
um yeah

03:27:41.510 --> 03:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:44.929 --> 03:27:44.939 align:start position:0%
so then we have 234 relative to
 
03:27:48.950 --> 03:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits
 
03:27:48.960 --> 03:27:56.050 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits
okay

03:27:56.050 --> 03:27:56.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:59.570 --> 03:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
it has no Financial impact it didn't
 
03:28:01.610 --> 03:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
really have a physical and I mean there
 
03:28:03.229 --> 03:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
was a difference of agreement on what
 
03:28:04.910 --> 03:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
the financial impact was but it didn't
 
03:28:07.190 --> 03:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
really have money associated with fifth
 
03:28:07.200 --> 03:28:08.710 align:start position:0%
really have money associated with fifth
grade

03:28:08.710 --> 03:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
grade
 
03:28:11.150 --> 03:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
so that's going to the full committee
 
03:28:13.090 --> 03:28:13.100 align:start position:0%
without recommendation
 
03:28:15.969 --> 03:28:15.979 align:start position:0%
I'm going to write a blurb for the itl
 
03:28:18.710 --> 03:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
side if somebody wants to write a blurb
 
03:28:25.030 --> 03:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:28.010 --> 03:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:28:31.790 --> 03:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
yeah no problem itl side
 
03:28:34.550 --> 03:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
I mean I'll do the OTP side I don't
 
03:28:36.590 --> 03:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
exactly know what I'm talking about but
 
03:28:38.570 --> 03:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
I'll make sure that I do well thank you
 
03:28:39.950 --> 03:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
you can
 
03:28:43.010 --> 03:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
copy or or use the blurb that
 
03:28:45.530 --> 03:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
was in the castle of the original just
 
03:28:47.929 --> 03:28:47.939 align:start position:0%
just go to representative McWilliams
 
03:28:53.330 --> 03:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:53.340 --> 03:28:54.650 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:28:54.650 --> 03:28:54.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:28:59.090 --> 03:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
so then we go down to house build 250
 
03:29:01.790 --> 03:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
that was relative to accidental death
 
03:29:08.210 --> 03:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:11.990 --> 03:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
and the uh it was indeterminable
 
03:29:14.510 --> 03:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
the financial impact because of course
 
03:29:16.490 --> 03:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
we don't know how many people maybe we
 
03:29:28.809 --> 03:29:28.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:31.250 --> 03:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
make sure you use your mic
 
03:29:31.260 --> 03:29:32.630 align:start position:0%
make sure you use your mic
oh

03:29:32.630 --> 03:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:29:32.640 --> 03:29:35.510 align:start position:0%
oh
because

03:29:35.510 --> 03:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:40.429 --> 03:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:43.250 --> 03:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking back here 250. so it did
 
03:29:45.349 --> 03:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
pass on the house floor
 
03:29:45.359 --> 03:29:48.349 align:start position:0%
pass on the house floor
260-103

03:29:48.349 --> 03:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
260-103
 
03:29:51.830 --> 03:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
and it was in the committee 15-5
 
03:29:53.870 --> 03:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
now one thing I thought was strange
 
03:29:56.570 --> 03:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
about this fiscal note on this bill was
 
03:29:59.389 --> 03:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
apparently there's roughly 20 19 in this
 
03:30:02.510 --> 03:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
category right now and the bill says
 
03:30:05.269 --> 03:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
none of them would get this benefit it
 
03:30:07.910 --> 03:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
would only be for new people in this in
 
03:30:11.630 --> 03:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
this category so I I would tend to think
 
03:30:14.150 --> 03:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
we'd want to do it for everybody in the
 
03:30:15.950 --> 03:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
category whether they've they're new or
 
03:30:17.510 --> 03:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
not you know if we're going to do
 
03:30:18.889 --> 03:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
something but
 
03:30:20.929 --> 03:30:20.939 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we have a fiscal note
 
03:30:20.939 --> 03:30:21.950 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we have a fiscal note
that

03:30:21.950 --> 03:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:30:24.469 --> 03:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
would show show you know what that's
 
03:30:26.990 --> 03:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
worth what they'll cause
 
03:30:29.389 --> 03:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
so you're saying going back to those
 
03:30:29.399 --> 03:30:30.349 align:start position:0%
so you're saying going back to those
that

03:30:30.349 --> 03:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:30:33.650 --> 03:30:33.660 align:start position:0%
lost a loved one
 
03:30:37.010 --> 03:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
well it's currently 50 and it moves it
 
03:30:39.670 --> 03:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
to a hundred yeah
 
03:30:42.530 --> 03:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
right so presumably if the fiscal note
 
03:30:45.110 --> 03:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
says how much the 50 is you could double
 
03:30:49.670 --> 03:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
it and right that would be pretty simple
 
03:30:52.969 --> 03:30:52.979 align:start position:0%
um Melissa it says four million well
 
03:30:54.889 --> 03:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
this has a sure I just wanted to make a
 
03:30:56.750 --> 03:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
clarifying point on the fiscal impact
 
03:30:59.090 --> 03:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
for HB 250 so the indeterminable
 
03:31:01.490 --> 03:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
increase for fiscal year 24 and 25
 
03:31:04.370 --> 03:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
that's just Associated costs
 
03:31:07.010 --> 03:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
um for them to update the pension system
 
03:31:09.710 --> 03:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
and then the the fiscal impact for the
 
03:31:11.990 --> 03:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
actual bail hits in fiscal year 26 which
 
03:31:15.110 --> 03:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
is 320 000 for the state and 1.3 million
 
03:31:15.120 --> 03:31:19.130 align:start position:0%
is 320 000 for the state and 1.3 million
subdivisions

03:31:19.130 --> 03:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:22.130 --> 03:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
but again is it covering those 19 that
 
03:31:24.769 --> 03:31:24.779 align:start position:0%
exist or is it assuming that we're going
 
03:31:26.690 --> 03:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
to get one or two more or something you
 
03:31:28.490 --> 03:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
know see what I mean yes I think what
 
03:31:30.830 --> 03:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:32.630 --> 03:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
they did any new
 
03:31:35.929 --> 03:31:35.939 align:start position:0%
um potential death in the workplace
 
03:31:39.110 --> 03:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
yeah coverage it wasn't for the preview
 
03:31:39.120 --> 03:31:40.610 align:start position:0%
yeah coverage it wasn't for the preview
assurance

03:31:40.610 --> 03:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
assurance
 
03:31:42.469 --> 03:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
I think that's going forward this is
 
03:31:45.349 --> 03:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
just going forward can I can I ask a
 
03:31:47.750 --> 03:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
question about this sure sure
 
03:31:47.760 --> 03:31:49.190 align:start position:0%
question about this sure sure
um

03:31:49.190 --> 03:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:52.490 --> 03:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
it's a hundred percent forever right
 
03:31:55.490 --> 03:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
a little spouse dies or the child or
 
03:31:57.650 --> 03:31:57.660 align:start position:0%
minor children
 
03:31:57.660 --> 03:31:59.030 align:start position:0%
minor children
so

03:31:59.030 --> 03:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:32:02.750 --> 03:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
if the person weren't killed on the job
 
03:32:02.760 --> 03:32:04.690 align:start position:0%
if the person weren't killed on the job
right

03:32:04.690 --> 03:32:04.700 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:32:07.370 --> 03:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
uh they'd get a hundred percent of their
 
03:32:11.030 --> 03:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
salary until such time as they retired
 
03:32:14.450 --> 03:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
and then they'd get whatever retirement
 
03:32:16.670 --> 03:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
they had earned at that point
 
03:32:19.849 --> 03:32:19.859 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me excessive
 
03:32:23.090 --> 03:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
that you would pay the spouse
 
03:32:27.769 --> 03:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
20 or 30 years beyond that date
 
03:32:27.779 --> 03:32:29.450 align:start position:0%
20 or 30 years beyond that date
uh

03:32:29.450 --> 03:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:32:32.110 --> 03:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
the full salary
 
03:32:35.510 --> 03:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
McGuire well yes and no because normally
 
03:32:38.030 --> 03:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
they would get their pension then after
 
03:32:39.290 --> 03:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
they retire
 
03:32:42.050 --> 03:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
right so they are being paid for the
 
03:32:45.170 --> 03:32:45.180 align:start position:0%
rest of their life and some okay so yeah
 
03:32:47.030 --> 03:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
but the pension wouldn't be the full
 
03:32:47.040 --> 03:32:50.050 align:start position:0%
but the pension wouldn't be the full
amount

03:32:50.050 --> 03:32:50.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:53.030 --> 03:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
these are police and fire and if they
 
03:32:55.570 --> 03:32:55.580 align:start position:0%
work long enough their pension can be
 
03:32:58.670 --> 03:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
near their their final salary right I
 
03:33:01.070 --> 03:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
mean not not necessarily
 
03:33:04.250 --> 03:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
um and then the other aspect is
 
03:33:05.809 --> 03:33:05.819 align:start position:0%
we're talking about somebody killed in
 
03:33:08.090 --> 03:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
the line of duty is they're still a
 
03:33:10.490 --> 03:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
young person right so they they may not
 
03:33:13.309 --> 03:33:13.319 align:start position:0%
have yet reached the final salary that
 
03:33:15.410 --> 03:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
they would have had they been working
 
03:33:16.610 --> 03:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
you know what I mean so they've been
 
03:33:19.190 --> 03:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
getting raises and they're down here so
 
03:33:22.070 --> 03:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's it's whatever it is
 
03:33:24.110 --> 03:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
but well I would argue that you know
 
03:33:26.269 --> 03:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
when you're alive you're being paid to
 
03:33:28.309 --> 03:33:28.319 align:start position:0%
do a job you're being paid here because
 
03:33:30.469 --> 03:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
you died I mean you gave the ultimate
 
03:33:34.250 --> 03:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
sacrifice you know on the job so I
 
03:33:36.290 --> 03:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have an issue with this
 
03:33:39.170 --> 03:33:39.180 align:start position:0%
are you uh represents Sweeney I I'd like
 
03:33:42.170 --> 03:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
can we get the numbers to for what it
 
03:33:45.229 --> 03:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
would be to all the current families uh
 
03:33:47.750 --> 03:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
that are receive the benefit to bring
 
03:33:50.389 --> 03:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
them up to 100 and that's fair question
 
03:33:52.849 --> 03:33:52.859 align:start position:0%
because I think just again reading this
 
03:33:55.389 --> 03:33:55.399 align:start position:0%
I think it's going forward right
 
03:33:57.469 --> 03:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
backwards for those that are getting 50
 
03:33:57.479 --> 03:33:58.670 align:start position:0%
backwards for those that are getting 50
percent

03:33:58.670 --> 03:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:34:01.070 --> 03:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
so Melissa and another
 
03:34:03.349 --> 03:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
tasks or reach out to the retirement
 
03:34:06.349 --> 03:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
system and sure I will just caveat it
 
03:34:08.450 --> 03:34:08.460 align:start position:0%
real quick that if they have to send it
 
03:34:10.969 --> 03:34:10.979 align:start position:0%
to the actuary to do this analysis they
 
03:34:12.290 --> 03:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
won't do it unless it's an approved
 
03:34:13.969 --> 03:34:13.979 align:start position:0%
Amendment because it is paid for out of
 
03:34:15.469 --> 03:34:15.479 align:start position:0%
General funds anytime it's sent to the
 
03:34:18.050 --> 03:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
actuary so oh yeah we had a big debate
 
03:34:22.010 --> 03:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
about yeah so ask the question is what
 
03:34:24.889 --> 03:34:24.899 align:start position:0%
do the current they currently receive
 
03:34:27.830 --> 03:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
right and we'll multiply by two in our
 
03:34:30.710 --> 03:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
minds okay so that shouldn't need an
 
03:34:33.710 --> 03:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
accurate representationals or now are
 
03:34:36.050 --> 03:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
you saying a hundred percent it would
 
03:34:40.429 --> 03:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:42.590 --> 03:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
saying a hundred percent of the pension
 
03:34:42.600 --> 03:34:44.990 align:start position:0%
saying a hundred percent of the pension
no

03:34:44.990 --> 03:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:34:46.849 --> 03:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
say that I'm sorry repeat that again it
 
03:34:48.349 --> 03:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
was based on the last 12 months that
 
03:34:51.110 --> 03:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
they worked ah thank you
 
03:34:53.050 --> 03:34:53.060 align:start position:0%
all right well we're making progress
 
03:34:56.570 --> 03:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
thanks Melissa
 
03:34:58.790 --> 03:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
and and the other possibility is that
 
03:35:00.530 --> 03:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
this won't actually come out of the
 
03:35:03.590 --> 03:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
general fund because if this is put on
 
03:35:06.050 --> 03:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
the retirement system it may be the
 
03:35:08.870 --> 03:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
employers who are going to pay for this
 
03:35:16.309 --> 03:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:24.229 --> 03:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:26.330 --> 03:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
I think we got a new fiscal note on this
 
03:35:28.630 --> 03:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
doing it yeah
 
03:35:31.750 --> 03:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah the most recent one I have is uh
 
03:35:34.370 --> 03:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
125 but this should have been a more
 
03:35:37.370 --> 03:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
recent one do we have a new fiscal note
 
03:35:40.510 --> 03:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
Melissa nope I believe the one
 
03:35:44.210 --> 03:35:44.220 align:start position:0%
25th 2023 is accurate
 
03:35:46.610 --> 03:35:46.620 align:start position:0%
okay so it does
 
03:35:48.469 --> 03:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
um increase pension rates you can see
 
03:35:51.590 --> 03:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
that on the second page
 
03:35:55.190 --> 03:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:00.070 --> 03:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:02.570 --> 03:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
background and impact from the
 
03:36:05.510 --> 03:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
retirement system that they gave us the
 
03:36:07.790 --> 03:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
bills the bill analysis
 
03:36:10.969 --> 03:36:10.979 align:start position:0%
says that bill increases the amount of
 
03:36:13.550 --> 03:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
State retirement annuity payable upon
 
03:36:15.229 --> 03:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
the accidental death of a group called
 
03:36:17.510 --> 03:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
number one hundred percent of
 
03:36:20.389 --> 03:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
convertible compensation that was at the
 
03:36:22.969 --> 03:36:22.979 align:start position:0%
time the member's death right okay I
 
03:36:29.330 --> 03:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
oh yeah well there's a lot a lot of
 
03:36:35.110 --> 03:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:37.849 --> 03:36:37.859 align:start position:0%
that's the answer man I've got more
 
03:36:39.950 --> 03:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
copies going there's a capital
 
03:36:43.910 --> 03:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation this was a repeat password
 
03:36:46.450 --> 03:36:46.460 align:start position:0%
oh the pfas okay
 
03:36:49.130 --> 03:36:49.140 align:start position:0%
so there's quite a bit leading up to
 
03:36:50.870 --> 03:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
that point
 
03:36:53.090 --> 03:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
I was sending Janet asked about next
 
03:36:55.429 --> 03:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
week or should we just put General yeah
 
03:36:57.370 --> 03:36:57.380 align:start position:0%
I said just general yeah
 
03:37:03.710 --> 03:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:06.110 --> 03:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
so we'll see DS anyway we'll get hope
 
03:37:09.110 --> 03:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
the answers on P fast and well I can I
 
03:37:09.120 --> 03:37:10.070 align:start position:0%
the answers on P fast and well I can I
can

03:37:10.070 --> 03:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:37:11.090 --> 03:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
I can open
 
03:37:12.650 --> 03:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
let's finish this and then I'll tell you
 
03:37:15.290 --> 03:37:15.300 align:start position:0%
what this says
 
03:37:18.769 --> 03:37:18.779 align:start position:0%
all right so then 269 we did act on that
 
03:37:21.469 --> 03:37:21.479 align:start position:0%
was ought to pass seven to two
 
03:37:23.690 --> 03:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
that was relative to limiting The
 
03:37:26.450 --> 03:37:26.460 align:start position:0%
Authority of New Hampshire delegates to
 
03:37:29.570 --> 03:37:29.580 align:start position:0%
policy making conventions
 
03:37:32.830 --> 03:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
so it could be here
 
03:37:35.630 --> 03:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
we've removed a hundred dollars yeah
 
03:37:38.389 --> 03:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
that was that was the clerk is correct
 
03:37:40.250 --> 03:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
it was an amendment to remove the house
 
03:37:40.260 --> 03:37:43.370 align:start position:0%
it was an amendment to remove the house
yeah

03:37:43.370 --> 03:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:46.010 --> 03:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
we made an amendment to remove the
 
03:37:48.290 --> 03:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars per day did someone
 
03:37:51.469 --> 03:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
write a blurb for this one uh yes a
 
03:37:54.290 --> 03:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney is coming with a
 
03:37:57.530 --> 03:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
blurb right okay
 
03:38:00.590 --> 03:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh let's see
 
03:38:09.910 --> 03:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:12.170 --> 03:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria is that how you say that
 
03:38:15.969 --> 03:38:15.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:19.729 --> 03:38:19.739 align:start position:0%
mitigation loan we did not do anything
 
03:38:20.990 --> 03:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
on that
 
03:38:22.969 --> 03:38:22.979 align:start position:0%
is is
 
03:38:24.830 --> 03:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
I have a question
 
03:38:30.110 --> 03:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:37.210 --> 03:38:37.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:40.910 --> 03:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:40.920 --> 03:38:42.889 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:38:42.889 --> 03:38:42.899 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:38:45.170 --> 03:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
you didn't do anything no we didn't can
 
03:38:45.180 --> 03:38:46.309 align:start position:0%
you didn't do anything no we didn't can
so

03:38:46.309 --> 03:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:38:46.319 --> 03:38:47.929 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:38:47.929 --> 03:38:47.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:50.030 --> 03:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
because this is a capital appropriation
 
03:38:52.610 --> 03:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
of 25 million dollars
 
03:38:56.210 --> 03:38:56.220 align:start position:0%
um I we talked about it and I thought
 
03:38:58.790 --> 03:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
that we should talk to the bonding
 
03:38:58.800 --> 03:39:00.229 align:start position:0%
that we should talk to the bonding
committee

03:39:00.229 --> 03:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:39:05.030 --> 03:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
um so I asked chairman McConkey to weigh
 
03:39:05.040 --> 03:39:05.929 align:start position:0%
um so I asked chairman McConkey to weigh
in

03:39:05.929 --> 03:39:05.939 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:39:05.939 --> 03:39:07.429 align:start position:0%
in
and

03:39:07.429 --> 03:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:39:10.070 --> 03:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
um we haven't heard back from him yet
 
03:39:12.110 --> 03:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
but you'll recall that the treasurer
 
03:39:14.990 --> 03:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
recommended 120 million dollar cap on
 
03:39:18.110 --> 03:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:20.510 --> 03:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Sweeney thank you so
 
03:39:22.490 --> 03:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
the one question I still Linger on this
 
03:39:22.500 --> 03:39:23.330 align:start position:0%
the one question I still Linger on this
one

03:39:23.330 --> 03:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:39:25.370 --> 03:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
from the testimony it's a naturally
 
03:39:30.110 --> 03:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
occurring bacteria that is only the
 
03:39:30.120 --> 03:39:31.070 align:start position:0%
occurring bacteria that is only the
increase

03:39:31.070 --> 03:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
increase
 
03:39:33.830 --> 03:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
around an area due to a street that's
 
03:39:37.429 --> 03:39:37.439 align:start position:0%
been built or septic tanks in the ground
 
03:39:40.969 --> 03:39:40.979 align:start position:0%
by the water so I'm just not clear on
 
03:39:43.910 --> 03:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
what the it would seem more expensive
 
03:39:46.849 --> 03:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
than 25 million dollars to mitigate it
 
03:39:49.969 --> 03:39:49.979 align:start position:0%
if it's existing roads and septic tanks
 
03:39:52.610 --> 03:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
that would need to be replaced if the
 
03:39:55.429 --> 03:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
goal is to actually mitigate the
 
03:39:57.410 --> 03:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
human impact
 
03:39:59.929 --> 03:39:59.939 align:start position:0%
that led to the increase so I I'm kind
 
03:40:02.090 --> 03:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
of lost there as to what the 25 million
 
03:40:05.389 --> 03:40:05.399 align:start position:0%
will actually noticeably do for these
 
03:40:05.399 --> 03:40:08.389 align:start position:0%
will actually noticeably do for these
projects

03:40:08.389 --> 03:40:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:11.170 --> 03:40:11.180 align:start position:0%
and and it can only be done on
 
03:40:15.889 --> 03:40:15.899 align:start position:0%
public lands AKA you can't use it for
 
03:40:15.899 --> 03:40:17.510 align:start position:0%
public lands AKA you can't use it for
private

03:40:17.510 --> 03:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
private
 
03:40:20.090 --> 03:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
systems and stuff like that that this
 
03:40:25.910 --> 03:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:25.920 --> 03:40:27.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:40:27.650 --> 03:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:29.389 --> 03:40:29.399 align:start position:0%
I believe they said they they don't use
 
03:40:32.809 --> 03:40:32.819 align:start position:0%
the money for for private landowners to
 
03:40:34.910 --> 03:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
fix their septic Wells or anything like
 
03:40:34.920 --> 03:40:38.030 align:start position:0%
fix their septic Wells or anything like
that

03:40:38.030 --> 03:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:40.190 --> 03:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
um it's a tough one representative
 
03:40:43.490 --> 03:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
McGuire to me this bill should be a a
 
03:40:46.670 --> 03:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
true retain in the sense that it's
 
03:40:49.610 --> 03:40:49.620 align:start position:0%
the funding is so murky
 
03:40:49.620 --> 03:40:50.210 align:start position:0%
the funding is so murky
um

03:40:50.210 --> 03:40:50.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:54.410 --> 03:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
and and the need is is sort of
 
03:40:54.420 --> 03:40:56.150 align:start position:0%
and and the need is is sort of
unknown

03:40:56.150 --> 03:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
unknown
 
03:40:58.130 --> 03:40:58.140 align:start position:0%
um that maybe we really ought to study
 
03:41:00.950 --> 03:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
this over the summer and and come up
 
03:41:03.170 --> 03:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
with a plan for it
 
03:41:05.750 --> 03:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know possibly
 
03:41:05.760 --> 03:41:06.910 align:start position:0%
you know possibly
um

03:41:06.910 --> 03:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:10.370 --> 03:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh you know some kind of assessment on
 
03:41:13.309 --> 03:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
on towns that have lakes that are
 
03:41:15.050 --> 03:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
affected or something like that you know
 
03:41:17.929 --> 03:41:17.939 align:start position:0%
what I mean or grant program or
 
03:41:19.929 --> 03:41:19.939 align:start position:0%
something but it it's just
 
03:41:23.389 --> 03:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
borrowing this money and spending it as
 
03:41:26.150 --> 03:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
Des likes I mean it's it's a little too
 
03:41:28.250 --> 03:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
vague and a little so I would say we
 
03:41:30.410 --> 03:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
should retain it and really retain it
 
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
and and study it and and try to come up
 
03:41:33.889 --> 03:41:33.899 align:start position:0%
with a
 
03:41:39.190 --> 03:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
a more a better thought out plan
 
03:41:41.690 --> 03:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire is moving to
 
03:41:45.889 --> 03:41:45.899 align:start position:0%
table I mean to retain really retain and
 
03:41:49.969 --> 03:41:49.979 align:start position:0%
representative evil is seconding that
 
03:41:52.490 --> 03:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
yeah and like I agree with that I I like
 
03:41:55.910 --> 03:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
to say again I'm on I'm on my uh
 
03:41:58.370 --> 03:41:58.380 align:start position:0%
Board of Directors for our pond and I
 
03:42:01.550 --> 03:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
can tell you that this issue it's it's a
 
03:42:03.110 --> 03:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
naturally occurring thing even if you
 
03:42:05.210 --> 03:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
take the human element out of it when
 
03:42:08.389 --> 03:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
you get warm Summers this type of a
 
03:42:11.090 --> 03:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
bloom will occur naturally just with
 
03:42:14.210 --> 03:42:14.220 align:start position:0%
what's out there in nature with no with
 
03:42:16.790 --> 03:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
no impact from Human so it's something
 
03:42:18.050 --> 03:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
that needs to be understood better
 
03:42:19.670 --> 03:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
before you start to spend this kind of
 
03:42:21.469 --> 03:42:21.479 align:start position:0%
money and you'll also recall the
 
03:42:25.010 --> 03:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
chairperson stated that as far as what
 
03:42:26.929 --> 03:42:26.939 align:start position:0%
actions you can take to mitigate like to
 
03:42:28.969 --> 03:42:28.979 align:start position:0%
neutralize these blooms they aren't
 
03:42:32.210 --> 03:42:32.220 align:start position:0%
doing any of that either so it's just a
 
03:42:33.769 --> 03:42:33.779 align:start position:0%
naturally occurring occurring thing and
 
03:42:35.510 --> 03:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
when it pops up in a leg they just let
 
03:42:37.849 --> 03:42:37.859 align:start position:0%
it take its course and then it the
 
03:42:40.550 --> 03:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
eventually the bloom goes away
 
03:42:43.130 --> 03:42:43.140 align:start position:0%
well part of it is climate change I mean
 
03:42:46.550 --> 03:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
if it is land use regulations I mean
 
03:42:48.530 --> 03:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
there's a little so I think it's worth
 
03:42:50.750 --> 03:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
retaining and understanding
 
03:42:54.830 --> 03:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
better so the chair wants me to take a
 
03:42:54.840 --> 03:42:55.729 align:start position:0%
better so the chair wants me to take a
vote

03:42:55.729 --> 03:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
vote
 
03:43:00.830 --> 03:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:03.410 --> 03:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
so to be clear if you we retain retain
 
03:43:05.570 --> 03:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
then it doesn't go into the budget for
 
03:43:07.309 --> 03:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
now that's right okay
 
03:43:10.510 --> 03:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
03:43:13.929 --> 03:43:13.939 align:start position:0%
okay so representative McGuire yes
 
03:43:16.010 --> 03:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin yes
 
03:43:17.690 --> 03:43:17.700 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney yes
 
03:43:20.210 --> 03:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
representative cambros yes
 
03:43:22.309 --> 03:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
03:43:26.450 --> 03:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
Schultz yes representative Hewitt yes
 
03:43:31.309 --> 03:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
clerk votes yes uh and a chair Leachman
 
03:43:42.710 --> 03:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:46.130 --> 03:43:46.140 align:start position:0%
I still can't I get lost in the ends in
 
03:43:48.469 --> 03:43:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:48.479 --> 03:43:51.429 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:43:51.429 --> 03:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:53.750 --> 03:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
we've all been waiting for
 
03:43:53.760 --> 03:43:59.630 align:start position:0%
we've all been waiting for
okay

03:43:59.630 --> 03:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:01.070 --> 03:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
now we have
 
03:44:03.710 --> 03:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill 300 that's
 
03:44:06.710 --> 03:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the disposal of certain food
 
03:44:06.720 --> 03:44:09.590 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the disposal of certain food
waste

03:44:09.590 --> 03:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:11.889 --> 03:44:11.899 align:start position:0%
something if my memories
 
03:44:14.750 --> 03:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
being supported very strongly by our
 
03:44:14.760 --> 03:44:16.010 align:start position:0%
being supported very strongly by our
Clerk

03:44:16.010 --> 03:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
Clerk
 
03:44:16.020 --> 03:44:18.590 align:start position:0%
Clerk
yeah

03:44:18.590 --> 03:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:20.330 --> 03:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
would you like to just speak to it we
 
03:44:21.830 --> 03:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
haven't made a decision we've had two
 
03:44:26.809 --> 03:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:29.870 --> 03:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:32.690 --> 03:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
talk a lot about the situation with
 
03:44:34.370 --> 03:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
solid waste in the state of New
 
03:44:34.380 --> 03:44:35.570 align:start position:0%
solid waste in the state of New
Hampshire

03:44:35.570 --> 03:44:35.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:44:38.870 --> 03:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
we have landfills for sure
 
03:44:38.880 --> 03:44:40.750 align:start position:0%
we have landfills for sure
um and

03:44:40.750 --> 03:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:44:44.690 --> 03:44:44.700 align:start position:0%
landfilling is not a great way to use
 
03:44:48.170 --> 03:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
things that can be used otherwise many
 
03:44:50.389 --> 03:44:50.399 align:start position:0%
years ago we made a determination that
 
03:44:52.130 --> 03:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be putting leaf and yard
 
03:44:56.150 --> 03:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
waste in our in our landfills food waste
 
03:44:58.550 --> 03:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
is something that can be used to feed
 
03:45:01.070 --> 03:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
the hungry it can also be used to
 
03:45:04.130 --> 03:45:04.140 align:start position:0%
compost it can be put to good use This
 
03:45:08.090 --> 03:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
only affects uh generators of food waste
 
03:45:11.510 --> 03:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
of one ton or more we've had not one
 
03:45:14.929 --> 03:45:14.939 align:start position:0%
single group step forward to oppose this
 
03:45:19.510 --> 03:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
it was supported by the ENA committee
 
03:45:23.210 --> 03:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
unanimously it passed on a Voice vote we
 
03:45:25.429 --> 03:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
had Waste Management here speaking in
 
03:45:27.590 --> 03:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
favor of it we had the municipal
 
03:45:30.050 --> 03:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
Association we had the New Hampshire
 
03:45:32.809 --> 03:45:32.819 align:start position:0%
food banks I mean this is when you talk
 
03:45:35.090 --> 03:45:35.100 align:start position:0%
about low-hanging fruit this is about as
 
03:45:38.870 --> 03:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
low hanging fruit as you can have this
 
03:45:41.090 --> 03:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
was a hundred percent supported by the
 
03:45:43.729 --> 03:45:43.739 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group it's supported
 
03:45:46.910 --> 03:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
by the solid waste management plan it's
 
03:45:49.070 --> 03:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
supported by all these
 
03:45:53.330 --> 03:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
um we've we recently passed a new Solid
 
03:45:55.429 --> 03:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
Waste diversion statute where we're
 
03:45:57.290 --> 03:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
trying to get weight out of weight out
 
03:46:00.710 --> 03:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
of the landfills that pass unanimously I
 
03:46:02.349 --> 03:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
mean all the stuff has passed
 
03:46:04.729 --> 03:46:04.739 align:start position:0%
unanimously out of the house on both
 
03:46:07.429 --> 03:46:07.439 align:start position:0%
sides the industry supports it waste
 
03:46:10.610 --> 03:46:10.620 align:start position:0%
management came in and and in fact so
 
03:46:12.769 --> 03:46:12.779 align:start position:0%
the other discussion that we had was
 
03:46:15.950 --> 03:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
that if you want to develop so the thing
 
03:46:18.590 --> 03:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind about this bill is you
 
03:46:20.750 --> 03:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
only have to do the diversion if there's
 
03:46:24.610 --> 03:46:24.620 align:start position:0%
a facility available to accept it
 
03:46:28.250 --> 03:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
within 20 miles so one of the things is
 
03:46:30.710 --> 03:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
that you want to help support the
 
03:46:33.769 --> 03:46:33.779 align:start position:0%
development of infrastructure and
 
03:46:35.530 --> 03:46:35.540 align:start position:0%
and what the waste management
 
03:46:38.630 --> 03:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative said if you can't sort of
 
03:46:40.910 --> 03:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
guarantee that you have a flow of food
 
03:46:43.190 --> 03:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
waste they're less inclined to make the
 
03:46:45.170 --> 03:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
investment to receive it
 
03:46:45.180 --> 03:46:46.429 align:start position:0%
investment to receive it
so

03:46:46.429 --> 03:46:46.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:46:48.349 --> 03:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
considering the fact that New Hampshire
 
03:46:50.929 --> 03:46:50.939 align:start position:0%
has done little or nothing over the last
 
03:46:53.389 --> 03:46:53.399 align:start position:0%
20 years to deal with their Solid Waste
 
03:46:53.399 --> 03:46:54.429 align:start position:0%
20 years to deal with their Solid Waste
issues

03:46:54.429 --> 03:46:54.439 align:start position:0%
issues
 
03:46:57.650 --> 03:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
we have to start doing something
 
03:47:00.889 --> 03:47:00.899 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a motion to retain
 
03:47:04.309 --> 03:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
well second up Representative no no
 
03:47:06.410 --> 03:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
problem so the physical note is really
 
03:47:10.490 --> 03:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
just the 97 025 for the staffer I know
 
03:47:11.870 --> 03:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
we're hearing from them at two is that
 
03:47:14.330 --> 03:47:14.340 align:start position:0%
in their budget or that well because
 
03:47:18.410 --> 03:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
this because this bill was not part of
 
03:47:20.510 --> 03:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
their scenario
 
03:47:23.210 --> 03:47:23.220 align:start position:0%
um it's not in their budget but
 
03:47:23.220 --> 03:47:24.830 align:start position:0%
um it's not in their budget but
um

03:47:24.830 --> 03:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:27.290 --> 03:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is that we have
 
03:47:29.750 --> 03:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
had no planning department in the solid
 
03:47:33.530 --> 03:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
waste Bureau again for like 20 years and
 
03:47:35.990 --> 03:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
so municipalities businesses there's
 
03:47:37.550 --> 03:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
just no planning there has been
 
03:47:40.309 --> 03:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
insufficient planning support So this
 
03:47:43.550 --> 03:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
person would work on this program and
 
03:47:47.269 --> 03:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
also begin to you know they can they can
 
03:47:49.190 --> 03:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
use it so they really need a third
 
03:47:51.469 --> 03:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
planning person which was something that
 
03:47:53.030 --> 03:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
I was going to talk to them about it
 
03:47:56.090 --> 03:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
anyway if we agree to include I mean if
 
03:47:58.849 --> 03:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
we can agree to include this uh with the
 
03:48:01.090 --> 03:48:01.100 align:start position:0%
second I'll just shut up about another
 
03:48:05.210 --> 03:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:07.790 --> 03:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
so representative McGuire is moving that
 
03:48:10.849 --> 03:48:10.859 align:start position:0%
we uh no I'm going to Second yeah okay
 
03:48:13.370 --> 03:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
oh you moved it well he I want her to
 
03:48:14.450 --> 03:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
write I don't want to write any blue
 
03:48:18.650 --> 03:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
okay I I'm I guess yeah okay oh you're
 
03:48:20.929 --> 03:48:20.939 align:start position:0%
right this is retained okay but to put
 
03:48:22.570 --> 03:48:22.580 align:start position:0%
make it clear it's not a retained
 
03:48:24.710 --> 03:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
retaining to put it in the budget
 
03:48:27.650 --> 03:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
retained for a house bill too okay all
 
03:48:29.750 --> 03:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
right we'll just have a show of hands if
 
03:48:34.870 --> 03:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:38.929 --> 03:48:38.939 align:start position:0%
so Melissa and Mike the the two in the
 
03:48:41.570 --> 03:48:41.580 align:start position:0%
budget please
 
03:48:43.370 --> 03:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
okay next
 
03:48:44.809 --> 03:48:44.819 align:start position:0%
next well but there was there was a
 
03:48:46.429 --> 03:48:46.439 align:start position:0%
second bill right yeah there is but it's
 
03:48:50.690 --> 03:48:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:52.309 --> 03:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
I mean if you want to talk about that
 
03:48:56.269 --> 03:48:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:59.809 --> 03:48:59.819 align:start position:0%
okay 311 was yeah so we have 311 that's
 
03:49:02.570 --> 03:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
is some of us know it's Buco bucks the
 
03:49:05.929 --> 03:49:05.939 align:start position:0%
governor included that in his budget the
 
03:49:05.939 --> 03:49:07.849 align:start position:0%
governor included that in his budget the
funding

03:49:07.849 --> 03:49:07.859 align:start position:0%
funding
 
03:49:12.110 --> 03:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
um we already retained that since so we
 
03:49:13.130 --> 03:49:13.140 align:start position:0%
don't have to we don't have to do
 
03:49:14.690 --> 03:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
anything on that then we have the
 
03:49:16.729 --> 03:49:16.739 align:start position:0%
National Guard recruitment that was 3
 
03:49:16.739 --> 03:49:18.170 align:start position:0%
National Guard recruitment that was 3
30.

03:49:18.170 --> 03:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
30.
 
03:49:21.490 --> 03:49:21.500 align:start position:0%
uh incentive program that was moved by
 
03:49:24.530 --> 03:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler past nine to zero
 
03:49:26.690 --> 03:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
so we're good there so that's 3 30.
 
03:49:29.870 --> 03:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's 3 30. certain amount
 
03:49:33.889 --> 03:49:33.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:41.530 --> 03:49:41.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:44.090 --> 03:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about we
 
03:49:46.570 --> 03:49:46.580 align:start position:0%
decided to pass it
 
03:49:53.110 --> 03:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:57.170 --> 03:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
so um 332 that's with uh School building
 
03:50:01.250 --> 03:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
Aid so we don't need that Mr chair on 3
 
03:50:03.050 --> 03:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
30 National Guard recruitment incentive
 
03:50:06.170 --> 03:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
program there is this amount in house
 
03:50:08.870 --> 03:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
bill one okay but they do want the
 
03:50:11.630 --> 03:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
policy language
 
03:50:14.450 --> 03:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
so you have the option of putting this
 
03:50:16.370 --> 03:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
in House Bill two taking it out of the
 
03:50:18.170 --> 03:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
budget or taking out of the budget and
 
03:50:20.990 --> 03:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
letting this pass right to say we put it
 
03:50:31.309 --> 03:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:33.830 --> 03:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
03:50:35.929 --> 03:50:35.939 align:start position:0%
because apparently the money was already
 
03:50:38.090 --> 03:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
in house bill one
 
03:50:40.790 --> 03:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
then for 311 we decided to retain and
 
03:50:43.670 --> 03:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:45.889 --> 03:50:45.899 align:start position:0%
it's our that is already in the
 
03:50:47.990 --> 03:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
03:50:50.150 --> 03:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
okay so we're just that's a real I mean
 
03:50:52.729 --> 03:50:52.739 align:start position:0%
we could technically vote to get rid of
 
03:50:53.630 --> 03:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
that but
 
03:50:55.550 --> 03:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
we should probably retain it till we see
 
03:50:58.490 --> 03:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
what happens in the Senate or no well
 
03:51:01.610 --> 03:51:01.620 align:start position:0%
once it leaves here it's okay so what do
 
03:51:02.929 --> 03:51:02.939 align:start position:0%
you want me to just I'll just write here
 
03:51:05.929 --> 03:51:05.939 align:start position:0%
retain okay so it's it's or just you
 
03:51:07.190 --> 03:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
could put a no it's already in the
 
03:51:10.790 --> 03:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
governance Budget on 311.
 
03:51:13.729 --> 03:51:13.739 align:start position:0%
so then we have the
 
03:51:15.370 --> 03:51:15.380 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
03:51:19.070 --> 03:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
337 relative to direct in the office of
 
03:51:21.170 --> 03:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
professional licensure
 
03:51:24.550 --> 03:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
public meeting that passed nine to zero
 
03:51:27.530 --> 03:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
let's move by representative choir so
 
03:51:30.550 --> 03:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
we're good there is that in the
 
03:51:33.110 --> 03:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
buttons that was odd to pay okay so
 
03:51:36.530 --> 03:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
that's going on its own yeah and that's
 
03:51:38.809 --> 03:51:38.819 align:start position:0%
going Merrily on its way which one was
 
03:51:41.090 --> 03:51:41.100 align:start position:0%
that the 337.
 
03:51:43.610 --> 03:51:43.620 align:start position:0%
between yeah because they took out money
 
03:51:47.150 --> 03:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
so there's it's just a bill yeah
 
03:51:49.309 --> 03:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
and I think that's on a full committee
 
03:51:52.190 --> 03:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
docket for whenever we meet next week so
 
03:51:55.309 --> 03:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
you have a few days
 
03:51:55.319 --> 03:51:57.290 align:start position:0%
you have a few days
uh

03:51:57.290 --> 03:51:57.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:52:00.550 --> 03:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
we have 347
 
03:52:02.690 --> 03:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
establishing a superior court land
 
03:52:05.510 --> 03:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
doctor we didn't take any action on that
 
03:52:07.190 --> 03:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
apparently it's uh we had two work
 
03:52:08.750 --> 03:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
sessions we know that came out of
 
03:52:10.849 --> 03:52:10.859 align:start position:0%
committee we heard from the judicial
 
03:52:12.969 --> 03:52:12.979 align:start position:0%
branch they're putting
 
03:52:17.150 --> 03:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
that judge in their budget Mr Hoffman
 
03:52:20.210 --> 03:52:20.220 align:start position:0%
yeah Mike has I think two amendments for
 
03:52:24.410 --> 03:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
this bill one to change 21 judges to 22
 
03:52:27.050 --> 03:52:27.060 align:start position:0%
yeah which apparently they forgot to put
 
03:52:30.110 --> 03:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
in House Bill too and the other one is
 
03:52:32.570 --> 03:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
all the tech stuff about this judge is a
 
03:52:35.210 --> 03:52:35.220 align:start position:0%
land use judge and that will go into
 
03:52:37.550 --> 03:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 as well so so we have two
 
03:52:40.490 --> 03:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
amendments right yeah do you have those
 
03:52:43.910 --> 03:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:47.450 --> 03:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
okay but if we want to we can dispense
 
03:52:51.710 --> 03:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
with this and do a straw poll of uh
 
03:52:53.809 --> 03:52:53.819 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be appropriate yeah okay
 
03:52:56.750 --> 03:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
so I'll I'll move or ask a second yeah
 
03:52:59.110 --> 03:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
to uh whatever you say put
 
03:53:03.050 --> 03:53:03.060 align:start position:0%
the house bill 347 the particulars into
 
03:53:06.889 --> 03:53:06.899 align:start position:0%
house bill 2. perfect
 
03:53:09.410 --> 03:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
I'll show a hands
 
03:53:09.420 --> 03:53:14.510 align:start position:0%
I'll show a hands
unanimous

03:53:14.510 --> 03:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:14.520 --> 03:53:16.150 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:53:16.150 --> 03:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:53:18.950 --> 03:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
sure there was conversation that we were
 
03:53:20.870 --> 03:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
we had during one of the work sessions
 
03:53:23.210 --> 03:53:23.220 align:start position:0%
about the
 
03:53:25.490 --> 03:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
caseload of the superior land use and
 
03:53:27.590 --> 03:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board yes and I
 
03:53:29.630 --> 03:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
remember the when the chairman Weiler
 
03:53:31.429 --> 03:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
was here he talked about ordering a
 
03:53:33.710 --> 03:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
performance audit of the housing appeals
 
03:53:36.290 --> 03:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
board how does one how would we do that
 
03:53:37.429 --> 03:53:37.439 align:start position:0%
does that have to be a piece of
 
03:53:38.870 --> 03:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
legislation or is that a question
 
03:53:41.450 --> 03:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
chairman can ask okay there's a special
 
03:53:45.050 --> 03:53:45.060 align:start position:0%
group a committee the audit performance
 
03:53:47.750 --> 03:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
audit committee yep and he can make that
 
03:53:49.550 --> 03:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
request so we could make it directly to
 
03:53:51.830 --> 03:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
the LBA from the finance or fiscal
 
03:53:51.840 --> 03:53:53.410 align:start position:0%
the LBA from the finance or fiscal
commission

03:53:53.410 --> 03:53:53.420 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:53:55.790 --> 03:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
so what I'm thinking is would it make
 
03:53:57.710 --> 03:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
sense as we're putting this in the
 
03:53:59.870 --> 03:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
budget incorporating that like after the
 
03:54:02.450 --> 03:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
first year of the superior land use
 
03:54:02.460 --> 03:54:04.010 align:start position:0%
first year of the superior land use
docket

03:54:04.010 --> 03:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
docket
 
03:54:06.469 --> 03:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
initiating a performance audit of both
 
03:54:11.590 --> 03:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:14.210 --> 03:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so I I've been thinking about
 
03:54:16.370 --> 03:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
this a little bit more
 
03:54:18.170 --> 03:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
um because because another issue was the
 
03:54:21.050 --> 03:54:21.060 align:start position:0%
fees charged by the bureau on tax of
 
03:54:22.689 --> 03:54:22.699 align:start position:0%
land appeal hadn't been changed since
 
03:54:26.090 --> 03:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
1977 or something and and
 
03:54:27.950 --> 03:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
um so here's what I'm thinking I'm
 
03:54:30.290 --> 03:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
thinking that just these are small
 
03:54:32.330 --> 03:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
numbers leave them alone in the budget
 
03:54:35.590 --> 03:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
for now but I'll put in a bill next year
 
03:54:38.750 --> 03:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
that would combine the Bureau of tax and
 
03:54:42.650 --> 03:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
land appeal an overused Department with
 
03:54:45.110 --> 03:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board put them under
 
03:54:48.710 --> 03:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
one roof doing both items because the
 
03:54:51.170 --> 03:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board is underused right
 
03:54:53.510 --> 03:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
and but they have similar experience
 
03:54:56.330 --> 03:54:56.340 align:start position:0%
right so so that that would be a bill to
 
03:54:59.389 --> 03:54:59.399 align:start position:0%
combine the two Under One Roof
 
03:55:01.790 --> 03:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
keep it as I don't know the board of tax
 
03:55:03.110 --> 03:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
and land appeal or whatever it's going
 
03:55:04.790 --> 03:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
to be called but give it the authority
 
03:55:06.650 --> 03:55:06.660 align:start position:0%
to do both
 
03:55:08.929 --> 03:55:08.939 align:start position:0%
um and that hopefully will re will
 
03:55:11.570 --> 03:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
relieve some of the overwork of one and
 
03:55:13.429 --> 03:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
the underwork of the other
 
03:55:16.729 --> 03:55:16.739 align:start position:0%
and and that's kind of my idea so um and
 
03:55:19.010 --> 03:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime I'll talk to both
 
03:55:21.530 --> 03:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
boards and do all that stuff you know
 
03:55:23.450 --> 03:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
but that that's my current plan
 
03:55:29.809 --> 03:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:31.610 --> 03:55:31.620 align:start position:0%
well the Superior Court would still be
 
03:55:35.330 --> 03:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
there as an option as it is now so so
 
03:55:36.889 --> 03:55:36.899 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:55:39.170 --> 03:55:39.180 align:start position:0%
these are boards that do the same thing
 
03:55:42.650 --> 03:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
as the superior court and you as an as
 
03:55:46.790 --> 03:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
somebody who wants to appeal uh has a
 
03:55:49.490 --> 03:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
choice I go Superior Court route or I go
 
03:55:52.370 --> 03:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
board route right and that won't change
 
03:55:56.929 --> 03:55:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:56.939 --> 03:55:59.090 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:55:59.090 --> 03:55:59.100 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:08.030 --> 03:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:09.889 --> 03:56:09.899 align:start position:0%
so do you want to speak to you I mean
 
03:56:12.050 --> 03:56:12.060 align:start position:0%
well I just wondered if since the
 
03:56:14.689 --> 03:56:14.699 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board is unfortunately I
 
03:56:16.429 --> 03:56:16.439 align:start position:0%
wasn't here for their presentation so I
 
03:56:18.110 --> 03:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
may be speaking out of term but for the
 
03:56:19.990 --> 03:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board since it's so
 
03:56:24.969 --> 03:56:24.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
we can do whatever I mean I don't know
 
03:56:29.090 --> 03:56:29.100 align:start position:0%
what the number was that they requested
 
03:56:31.670 --> 03:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
or I don't know what you had in mind I
 
03:56:33.650 --> 03:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
don't think it was an increase right no
 
03:56:35.210 --> 03:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
I thought it was they had an increase
 
03:56:35.220 --> 03:56:41.870 align:start position:0%
I thought it was they had an increase
yeah

03:56:41.870 --> 03:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:46.250 --> 03:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:53.590 --> 03:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:02.510 --> 03:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:05.689 --> 03:57:05.699 align:start position:0%
oh I'm unplugged again
 
03:57:05.699 --> 03:57:11.570 align:start position:0%
oh I'm unplugged again
ah

03:57:11.570 --> 03:57:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:15.370 --> 03:57:15.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:17.950 --> 03:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
I have a nail in it
 
03:57:20.269 --> 03:57:20.279 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that'll work I see what you
 
03:57:21.590 --> 03:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
mean well
 
03:57:24.290 --> 03:57:24.300 align:start position:0%
not really the the
 
03:57:26.809 --> 03:57:26.819 align:start position:0%
it's really the same as 23 adjusted
 
03:57:31.490 --> 03:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
authorites they did under spend in 22.
 
03:57:34.070 --> 03:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
okay yeah they had what but there's no
 
03:57:37.250 --> 03:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
there's even a slight decrease from 23 I
 
03:57:39.710 --> 03:57:39.720 align:start position:0%
adjusted off
 
03:57:42.650 --> 03:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
wait a minute well they had
 
03:57:47.330 --> 03:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
when maybe yeah they had 390 for their
 
03:57:53.450 --> 03:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
actual expenses they're asking for 5 17.
 
03:57:57.830 --> 03:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
for 24. can I stick my ore into the
 
03:58:00.450 --> 03:58:00.460 align:start position:0%
water oh absolutely unplug his mic quick
 
03:58:00.460 --> 03:58:03.769 align:start position:0%
water oh absolutely unplug his mic quick
[Laughter]

03:58:03.769 --> 03:58:03.779 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:58:06.590 --> 03:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
I'll go right ahead uh that's one of
 
03:58:08.030 --> 03:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
these things where you have to keep your
 
03:58:11.990 --> 03:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
eye on the ball uh the bill that's in in
 
03:58:15.889 --> 03:58:15.899 align:start position:0%
in committee is a bill to create a new
 
03:58:18.349 --> 03:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
Superior Court judge
 
03:58:20.689 --> 03:58:20.699 align:start position:0%
and you can put a period at the end of
 
03:58:25.550 --> 03:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
that and because what happens after that
 
03:58:29.330 --> 03:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
is entirely within the interior workings
 
03:58:31.729 --> 03:58:31.739 align:start position:0%
of the superior court because they're
 
03:58:36.950 --> 03:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
only going to deal with uh land uh
 
03:58:41.330 --> 03:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:44.389 --> 03:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
so whatever you do whatever you if you
 
03:58:46.090 --> 03:58:46.100 align:start position:0%
want if you want to
 
03:58:50.150 --> 03:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
change anything about the land use board
 
03:58:52.490 --> 03:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
uh you're probably going to run across
 
03:58:56.349 --> 03:58:56.359 align:start position:0%
the idea that there's no no bill pending
 
03:58:59.689 --> 03:58:59.699 align:start position:0%
that would allow you to do that
 
03:59:01.729 --> 03:59:01.739 align:start position:0%
nobody has suggested that anything
 
03:59:04.010 --> 03:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
happened to the land land appeal he was
 
03:59:07.670 --> 03:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
born and thus it's not a prop of subject
 
03:59:10.010 --> 03:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
to a legislation will representative
 
03:59:13.250 --> 03:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
McGuire suggested uh a few minutes ago
 
03:59:16.309 --> 03:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
that he would put a bill in next year to
 
03:59:20.450 --> 03:59:20.460 align:start position:0%
look at both the housing appeals for the
 
03:59:22.490 --> 03:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
board of landed tax appeals it may be
 
03:59:24.710 --> 03:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
combine the two because they have
 
03:59:26.510 --> 03:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
similar in a sense it would be a new
 
03:59:28.250 --> 03:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
bill for next year all right so what
 
03:59:30.769 --> 03:59:30.779 align:start position:0%
would you do with the current bill
 
03:59:33.349 --> 03:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
all right so the current bill we're
 
03:59:35.150 --> 03:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
putting in a house bill we're passing it
 
03:59:36.650 --> 03:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
yeah we're putting in the house bill too
 
03:59:39.830 --> 03:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's the land use judge right
 
03:59:43.490 --> 03:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
and but okay okay
 
03:59:45.050 --> 03:59:45.060 align:start position:0%
you know I'm sure you'll get a nice
 
03:59:48.229 --> 03:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
visit from well to achieve Justice well
 
03:59:50.269 --> 03:59:50.279 align:start position:0%
they agreed right we we asked him about
 
03:59:52.210 --> 03:59:52.220 align:start position:0%
it and they said no problem
 
03:59:55.250 --> 03:59:55.260 align:start position:0%
yeah they would be happy to have it as a
 
03:59:57.349 --> 03:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
land use judge that they would
 
03:59:59.630 --> 03:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
specifically handle those land use cases
 
04:00:01.790 --> 04:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
and if they didn't have a case he might
 
04:00:03.950 --> 04:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
step in or she might step into another
 
04:00:06.889 --> 04:00:06.899 align:start position:0%
case but that would that would that
 
04:00:09.410 --> 04:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
would require what he what uh what the
 
04:00:13.849 --> 04:00:13.859 align:start position:0%
judge was suggesting was that uh they
 
04:00:16.370 --> 04:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
would the the state would appoint
 
04:00:19.010 --> 04:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
another judge in other words oh yeah
 
04:00:21.110 --> 04:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's it yeah all right so there's
 
04:00:23.150 --> 04:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
you'd have to you'd have to appropriate
 
04:00:25.250 --> 04:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
the money we have we that was in their
 
04:00:28.309 --> 04:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
budget okay yeah they already had it in
 
04:00:30.769 --> 04:00:30.779 align:start position:0%
their budget and there's a place in law
 
04:00:33.469 --> 04:00:33.479 align:start position:0%
which says they have 21 judges so one of
 
04:00:35.210 --> 04:00:35.220 align:start position:0%
our amendments crossed out twenty one we
 
04:00:38.870 --> 04:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
put 22. all right okay just want to make
 
04:00:40.189 --> 04:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
sure everybody understands what's going
 
04:00:41.990 --> 04:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
on sure
 
04:00:44.450 --> 04:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
it's like they
 
04:00:46.490 --> 04:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
they understand their budget in 22
 
04:00:49.250 --> 04:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
because somebody was vacant
 
04:00:51.769 --> 04:00:51.779 align:start position:0%
right so you know that's what's going on
 
04:00:53.389 --> 04:00:53.399 align:start position:0%
that's everything wrong they may still
 
04:00:56.050 --> 04:00:56.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:56.060 --> 04:00:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
laughs

04:00:57.830 --> 04:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
laughs
 
04:00:59.870 --> 04:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
so is there any more discussion on
 
04:01:02.269 --> 04:01:02.279 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board other than
 
04:01:06.110 --> 04:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:07.729 --> 04:01:07.739 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:01:07.739 --> 04:01:25.610 align:start position:0%
all right
thanks

04:01:25.610 --> 04:01:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:28.990 --> 04:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
so it being almost two o'clock
 
04:01:32.269 --> 04:01:32.279 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services is before us
 
04:01:34.729 --> 04:01:34.739 align:start position:0%
for their second time
 
04:01:36.950 --> 04:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
as far as their actual budget will be
 
04:01:38.510 --> 04:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
the first time I believe but they did
 
04:01:40.550 --> 04:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
have a presentation a while back on what
 
04:01:44.170 --> 04:01:44.180 align:start position:0%
they do and this is found on page
 
04:01:46.610 --> 04:01:46.620 align:start position:0%
671 yeah
 
04:01:48.889 --> 04:01:48.899 align:start position:0%

members are doing well too
 
04:01:57.050 --> 04:01:57.060 align:start position:0%
you know we have a lot of questions for
 
04:01:58.849 --> 04:01:58.859 align:start position:0%

04:02:01.910 --> 04:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
some house bills and some
 
04:02:04.189 --> 04:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 issues so what we'll let
 
04:02:06.349 --> 04:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
you go into your budget first and then
 
04:02:08.570 --> 04:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
we'll go on to the other questions okay
 
04:02:10.429 --> 04:02:10.439 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh thank you for having us
 
04:02:15.349 --> 04:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
as always uh so our we passed out a
 
04:02:17.269 --> 04:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint presentation so I'm going to
 
04:02:19.610 --> 04:02:19.620 align:start position:0%
talk to the slides uh if you have those
 
04:02:23.330 --> 04:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
in front of you uh so I'll start with
 
04:02:25.189 --> 04:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
I just want to do some introductions so
 
04:02:28.189 --> 04:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
I think most you from the orientation uh
 
04:02:30.650 --> 04:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
that uh the chair mentioned props may
 
04:02:33.950 --> 04:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
remember uh so the org chart is on our
 
04:02:36.769 --> 04:02:36.779 align:start position:0%
second page and I'll I'll start with our
 
04:02:38.929 --> 04:02:38.939 align:start position:0%
chief operating officer Susan Carlson uh
 
04:02:40.250 --> 04:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
she'll have a
 
04:02:42.349 --> 04:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
a large part of what we discussed today
 
04:02:44.750 --> 04:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh given that she orchestrates our
 
04:02:44.760 --> 04:02:46.189 align:start position:0%
uh given that she orchestrates our
budget

04:02:46.189 --> 04:02:46.199 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:02:48.170 --> 04:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
um I'll also point out our assistant
 
04:02:50.389 --> 04:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner Mark Sanborn
 
04:02:52.670 --> 04:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
what if you can see him behind me our
 
04:02:56.210 --> 04:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
Waste Management director uh Mike wimsat
 
04:02:58.250 --> 04:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
our Water Division director Randy
 
04:03:01.370 --> 04:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
Pelletier and our Air Resource division
 
04:03:03.710 --> 04:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
director Craig Wright so and then we
 
04:03:05.750 --> 04:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
have some additional staff here beyond
 
04:03:08.870 --> 04:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
that to hopefully our desire our goal is
 
04:03:10.790 --> 04:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions you have so we
 
04:03:13.189 --> 04:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
brought some additional staff so I won't
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
I won't take up time with our mission
 
04:03:16.490 --> 04:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
statement but certainly if you have
 
04:03:17.750 --> 04:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
questions about our functions and
 
04:03:20.150 --> 04:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
mission statement uh we can talk to that
 
04:03:21.950 --> 04:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
but since we did do the orientation I'll
 
04:03:23.689 --> 04:03:23.699 align:start position:0%
suspense of those
 
04:03:27.110 --> 04:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
so some highlights on the budget uh
 
04:03:31.309 --> 04:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
it will go into detail clearly is our
 
04:03:35.870 --> 04:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
24 25 operating budget ask is uh 341
 
04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars annually a lot of that
 
04:03:42.349 --> 04:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
and again we can discuss in detail uh is
 
04:03:44.929 --> 04:03:44.939 align:start position:0%
uh from federal funding increases so the
 
04:03:48.590 --> 04:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Bill uh from Congress uh
 
04:03:50.750 --> 04:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
is is Flowing a lot of money for water
 
04:03:53.030 --> 04:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
and wastewater infrastructure projects
 
04:03:56.809 --> 04:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
uh through us and really through again
 
04:03:58.729 --> 04:03:58.739 align:start position:0%
we'll talk through this but uh it
 
04:04:01.910 --> 04:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
expands a lot of our programs our state
 
04:04:03.769 --> 04:04:03.779 align:start position:0%
revolving loan programs for both clean
 
04:04:06.650 --> 04:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
water uh and drinking water again clean
 
04:04:09.590 --> 04:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
water is storm water and wastewater uh
 
04:04:12.530 --> 04:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
despite the name uh in coastal
 
04:04:14.809 --> 04:04:14.819 align:start position:0%
resiliency uh we have emerging
 
04:04:17.630 --> 04:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
contaminant uh funds from uh the federal
 
04:04:20.210 --> 04:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
government we have plus-ups and super
 
04:04:23.689 --> 04:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
funds are we have new new monies for
 
04:04:26.809 --> 04:04:26.819 align:start position:0%
lead and copper uh in drinking water uh
 
04:04:30.710 --> 04:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
piping brownfields and uh and Dam safety
 
04:04:33.889 --> 04:04:33.899 align:start position:0%
and you'll see again at the end a lot of
 
04:04:35.750 --> 04:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
this we've
 
04:04:37.330 --> 04:04:37.340 align:start position:0%
due to the extra funding and other
 
04:04:40.610 --> 04:04:40.620 align:start position:0%
Associated uh impacts we're also asking
 
04:04:42.410 --> 04:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
for some additional positions here so we
 
04:04:44.929 --> 04:04:44.939 align:start position:0%
can talk about that so in the in the
 
04:04:47.150 --> 04:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
following slides
 
04:04:49.790 --> 04:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I we we found that it seems to help
 
04:04:51.769 --> 04:04:51.779 align:start position:0%
the committee says Sue Carlson has has
 
04:04:53.630 --> 04:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
broken down by category in the different
 
04:04:56.929 --> 04:04:56.939 align:start position:0%
slides uh of what we're what we have and
 
04:04:59.269 --> 04:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
what we're asking for so I so I'll I'll
 
04:05:01.010 --> 04:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
pass off to her for that portion of the
 
04:05:03.590 --> 04:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
presentation uh but again we're going to
 
04:05:12.110 --> 04:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:14.570 --> 04:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
um starting with slide six
 
04:05:17.030 --> 04:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
um and slide seven slide six deals with
 
04:05:19.610 --> 04:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
what our sources of funds are slide
 
04:05:21.769 --> 04:05:21.779 align:start position:0%
seven deals with what we do with that
 
04:05:23.570 --> 04:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
money that we have
 
04:05:25.790 --> 04:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
um starting with slide six
 
04:05:28.250 --> 04:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
um as you can see
 
04:05:30.590 --> 04:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
um we have a great deal of federal funds
 
04:05:32.929 --> 04:05:32.939 align:start position:0%
our budget is broken out and federal
 
04:05:36.650 --> 04:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
funds between the srf fennel funds and
 
04:05:38.689 --> 04:05:38.699 align:start position:0%
the reason I break out srf separately
 
04:05:40.610 --> 04:05:40.620 align:start position:0%
from your other from other federal funds
 
04:05:42.769 --> 04:05:42.779 align:start position:0%
is because they are their own company in
 
04:05:44.210 --> 04:05:44.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire first
 
04:05:46.490 --> 04:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
and in the budget they're broken out
 
04:05:49.250 --> 04:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
separately in here so I did that to make
 
04:05:51.469 --> 04:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
it easier for you to read
 
04:05:54.110 --> 04:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
um the srf repayment funds those are the
 
04:05:56.030 --> 04:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
monies that come back to us via loans
 
04:05:59.210 --> 04:05:59.220 align:start position:0%
that we use to reloan money out
 
04:06:02.689 --> 04:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
um they make up 16 the srf funds federal
 
04:06:05.990 --> 04:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
funds make up 26 percent that's 42
 
04:06:08.030 --> 04:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
percent of our entire operating budget
 
04:06:11.330 --> 04:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
our other Federal programs are at 50 mil
 
04:06:14.090 --> 04:06:14.100 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars which is 15 percent
 
04:06:16.910 --> 04:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
of our operating budget our fee accounts
 
04:06:20.210 --> 04:06:20.220 align:start position:0%
account for 27 percent of our operating
 
04:06:22.070 --> 04:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
budget with approximately 90 million
 
04:06:23.389 --> 04:06:23.399 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
04:06:25.610 --> 04:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
the groundwater drinking water ground
 
04:06:27.070 --> 04:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
where I trust
 
04:06:29.809 --> 04:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
accounts for 12 percent and then our
 
04:06:31.429 --> 04:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
general funds which is our smallest
 
04:06:33.170 --> 04:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
portion of our budget is 17 million
 
04:06:34.670 --> 04:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
account for just five percent of our
 
04:06:36.769 --> 04:06:36.779 align:start position:0%
entire operating budget
 
04:06:40.910 --> 04:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
as to use this as slides on numbers
 
04:06:43.370 --> 04:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
um slide seven
 
04:06:47.150 --> 04:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
as we note at the top of the slide 74 of
 
04:06:49.189 --> 04:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
all of our funds are going out the door
 
04:06:51.410 --> 04:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
in the form of Grants reimbursement
 
04:06:53.809 --> 04:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
loans and contracts
 
04:06:56.570 --> 04:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
that only means 26 percent stays within
 
04:06:57.469 --> 04:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:07:00.290 --> 04:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
of that small portion operating expenses
 
04:07:02.689 --> 04:07:02.699 align:start position:0%
account for four percent that's current
 
04:07:05.809 --> 04:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
expense equipment
 
04:07:09.610 --> 04:07:09.620 align:start position:0%
salary benefits account for 20 percent
 
04:07:12.290 --> 04:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
interagency transfers that's payments to
 
04:07:15.110 --> 04:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
admin Services doit Attorney General's
 
04:07:18.050 --> 04:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
office that accounts for 7.9 million or
 
04:07:20.090 --> 04:07:20.100 align:start position:0%
two percent of our budget
 
04:07:22.389 --> 04:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
oil fund reimbursements and mtbe
 
04:07:25.309 --> 04:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursements are 22 million dollars
 
04:07:27.229 --> 04:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
that counts for seven percent of our
 
04:07:31.010 --> 04:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
operating budget overall all grants at
 
04:07:33.790 --> 04:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
47 million account for 14
 
04:07:37.429 --> 04:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
loans are a single biggest cost category
 
04:07:41.809 --> 04:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
at 149 million dollars and for the 24 25
 
04:07:44.929 --> 04:07:44.939 align:start position:0%
operating budget that's 44 of our entire
 
04:07:44.939 --> 04:07:46.130 align:start position:0%
operating budget that's 44 of our entire
budget

04:07:46.130 --> 04:07:46.140 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:07:48.469 --> 04:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
and then contracts make up the balance
 
04:07:50.630 --> 04:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
at 31 million dollars which is
 
04:07:52.969 --> 04:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
approximately nine percent
 
04:07:52.979 --> 04:07:55.010 align:start position:0%
approximately nine percent
now

04:07:55.010 --> 04:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:07:56.450 --> 04:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:07:58.910 --> 04:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for coming so on the loans
 
04:07:58.920 --> 04:08:00.530 align:start position:0%
um thank you for coming so on the loans

04:08:00.530 --> 04:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
category
 
04:08:04.370 --> 04:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
um how good is our repayments do we do
 
04:08:06.950 --> 04:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
we ever forgive loans do we have problem
 
04:08:09.229 --> 04:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
loans what's going on there
 
04:08:12.170 --> 04:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
we don't forgive loans but
 
04:08:14.750 --> 04:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
um under the clean water and drinking
 
04:08:16.610 --> 04:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
water srf there is a principle
 
04:08:16.620 --> 04:08:18.010 align:start position:0%
water srf there is a principle
forgiveness

04:08:18.010 --> 04:08:18.020 align:start position:0%
forgiveness
 
04:08:20.389 --> 04:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
portion of the loans which is built into
 
04:08:22.010 --> 04:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
the federal law
 
04:08:25.790 --> 04:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
so we do forgive a portion of the loans
 
04:08:28.790 --> 04:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
and depending on the type of loan the
 
04:08:30.530 --> 04:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
principal forgiveness is even given
 
04:08:33.229 --> 04:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
given up front with the first payment or
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
given over time
 
04:08:37.550 --> 04:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
with each payment and I do that based on
 
04:08:41.689 --> 04:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:43.729 --> 04:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
so I could I think a short answer is
 
04:08:45.830 --> 04:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
we've we've not had a defaulting on any
 
04:08:47.990 --> 04:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the loans that we've we've granted
 
04:08:49.610 --> 04:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
if that's the question I think which I
 
04:08:53.090 --> 04:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
think it is but yeah I I guess of this
 
04:08:56.630 --> 04:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
150 million that's going out this this
 
04:08:59.450 --> 04:08:59.460 align:start position:0%
year uh or 2024
 
04:09:01.370 --> 04:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
would how much would you expect to get
 
04:09:01.380 --> 04:09:02.450 align:start position:0%
would how much would you expect to get
back

04:09:02.450 --> 04:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
back
 
04:09:10.670 --> 04:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:13.070 --> 04:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
you said some Is Forgiven right or
 
04:09:15.410 --> 04:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
something yeah I cannot tell you how
 
04:09:18.650 --> 04:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
much of the 149 will be forgiven because
 
04:09:21.530 --> 04:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
it depends entirely on who is borrowing
 
04:09:23.030 --> 04:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
the money
 
04:09:26.269 --> 04:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
okay disadvantaged communities
 
04:09:29.030 --> 04:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
get a certain percentage of principal
 
04:09:31.910 --> 04:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
forgiveness if the city of Portsmouth
 
04:09:34.910 --> 04:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
takes all 149 million we get zero
 
04:09:34.920 --> 04:09:36.889 align:start position:0%
takes all 149 million we get zero
forgiveness

04:09:36.889 --> 04:09:36.899 align:start position:0%
forgiveness
 
04:09:40.189 --> 04:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
um but if we have small towns or small
 
04:09:42.889 --> 04:09:42.899 align:start position:0%
non non-public Water Systems they can
 
04:09:44.389 --> 04:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
get principal forgiveness of different
 
04:09:47.210 --> 04:09:47.220 align:start position:0%
amounts we actually are required under
 
04:09:49.309 --> 04:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
the clean water and drinking water srf
 
04:09:52.849 --> 04:09:52.859 align:start position:0%
program to forgive a set percentage and
 
04:09:55.370 --> 04:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
or dollar amount of the entire Federal
 
04:09:58.849 --> 04:09:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:00.950 --> 04:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
and then and that percentages so you're
 
04:10:05.090 --> 04:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
talking about of the 88.2 million right
 
04:10:06.950 --> 04:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
certain amount which is the Federal
 
04:10:11.630 --> 04:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
grant for srf yes right so that's going
 
04:10:14.410 --> 04:10:14.420 align:start position:0%
to become part of this 150 that goes out
 
04:10:17.630 --> 04:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
so but a certain percentage of that has
 
04:10:21.769 --> 04:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
to be a grant effectively or well
 
04:10:24.110 --> 04:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
technically on the clean water side it
 
04:10:26.269 --> 04:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
has to be labeled as Prince forgiveness
 
04:10:29.929 --> 04:10:29.939 align:start position:0%
on the drinking water side we do offer
 
04:10:32.570 --> 04:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
grants so what is that percent is it 50
 
04:10:36.170 --> 04:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
10 well this is a
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
this is an odd biennium because a lot of
 
04:10:43.189 --> 04:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
this extra grant money and this extra
 
04:10:46.070 --> 04:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
srf money is coming through the bill
 
04:10:49.010 --> 04:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
program so for instance the lead and
 
04:10:52.790 --> 04:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
copper Grant which is under the srf
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
program is 28 million dollars most of
 
04:10:58.309 --> 04:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
that's going on in Grants
 
04:11:01.250 --> 04:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
and we can get into the details when we
 
04:11:03.290 --> 04:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
get into the pages of the budget but if
 
04:11:06.830 --> 04:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
it really varies normally
 
04:11:06.840 --> 04:11:07.429 align:start position:0%
it really varies normally
um

04:11:07.429 --> 04:11:07.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:10.429 --> 04:11:10.439 align:start position:0%
it is less than 10 percent of our
 
04:11:12.830 --> 04:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
federal award goes out in terms of
 
04:11:14.750 --> 04:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
principal forgiveness
 
04:11:17.809 --> 04:11:17.819 align:start position:0%
so whatever we love but it varies thank
 
04:11:21.110 --> 04:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
you asking what interest rate and did
 
04:11:22.790 --> 04:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
you ask what our current interest rate
 
04:11:22.800 --> 04:11:24.410 align:start position:0%
you ask what our current interest rate
is

04:11:24.410 --> 04:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:11:26.450 --> 04:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
um just so you know our interest rate is
 
04:11:28.130 --> 04:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
set every August
 
04:11:30.170 --> 04:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
and right now for clean water it's two
 
04:11:30.180 --> 04:11:31.250 align:start position:0%
and right now for clean water it's two
percent

04:11:31.250 --> 04:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:11:33.290 --> 04:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
and for drinking water it's a sliding
 
04:11:37.070 --> 04:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
scale starting at 2.53 going down
 
04:11:39.889 --> 04:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
depending on the number of years the LA
 
04:11:42.349 --> 04:11:42.359 align:start position:0%
the the longer the loan the higher the
 
04:11:45.170 --> 04:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
rate maxing at 2.53
 
04:11:47.570 --> 04:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
is that all my statute or is it hey
 
04:11:49.309 --> 04:11:49.319 align:start position:0%
there's all by Federal Regulation and
 
04:11:51.710 --> 04:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
it's all posted out on our website okay
 
04:11:54.889 --> 04:11:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:54.899 --> 04:12:00.710 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:12:00.710 --> 04:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:04.010 --> 04:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
going to slide eight
 
04:12:06.710 --> 04:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
um in order to show you as the
 
04:12:08.210 --> 04:12:08.220 align:start position:0%
commissioner said we have three main
 
04:12:10.010 --> 04:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
divisions plus the commissioner's office
 
04:12:11.929 --> 04:12:11.939 align:start position:0%
this slide
 
04:12:14.269 --> 04:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
um I gave to you to show you exactly
 
04:12:16.910 --> 04:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
what division has the majority of our
 
04:12:19.189 --> 04:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
money obviously the commissioner's
 
04:12:22.189 --> 04:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
office we operate at 8.3 million and
 
04:12:24.469 --> 04:12:24.479 align:start position:0%
we're just two percent of the entire
 
04:12:26.990 --> 04:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
department the air division is at 12
 
04:12:29.330 --> 04:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
million which is four percent of the
 
04:12:32.689 --> 04:12:32.699 align:start position:0%
department the Water Division which is a
 
04:12:35.689 --> 04:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
combination of the water srf and all
 
04:12:39.170 --> 04:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
other programs is at 60 percent of our
 
04:12:41.510 --> 04:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
department they are the biggest Division
 
04:12:44.269 --> 04:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
and number of employees and dollars and
 
04:12:47.929 --> 04:12:47.939 align:start position:0%
then waste management is at 34 and 115
 
04:12:51.590 --> 04:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:54.710 --> 04:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
what I've done on the next slide is to
 
04:12:56.929 --> 04:12:56.939 align:start position:0%
give you an analysis of our overall
 
04:12:56.939 --> 04:12:58.610 align:start position:0%
give you an analysis of our overall
Department

04:12:58.610 --> 04:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
Department
 
04:13:01.610 --> 04:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
um by cost category what I am showing
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
you today is what we have for FY 23
 
04:13:05.040 --> 04:13:06.229 align:start position:0%
you today is what we have for FY 23
budget

04:13:06.229 --> 04:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:13:09.830 --> 04:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
our 24 budget and then our 25 budget and
 
04:13:11.630 --> 04:13:11.640 align:start position:0%
what is the change in the percent change
 
04:13:15.530 --> 04:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
from 23 to 24 and 24 to 25.
 
04:13:19.729 --> 04:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
as you can see from 23 to 24 our overall
 
04:13:22.490 --> 04:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
budget went up 89 million dollars that's
 
04:13:25.370 --> 04:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
a 35 increase
 
04:13:29.809 --> 04:13:29.819 align:start position:0%
most of that as you can see is a an 81
 
04:13:31.849 --> 04:13:31.859 align:start position:0%
percent increase in our grand line of 21
 
04:13:35.389 --> 04:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
million dollars our loans went up 48 by
 
04:13:38.150 --> 04:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
48 and a half million dollars and our
 
04:13:42.050 --> 04:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
contracts went up 16.4 million dollars
 
04:13:44.330 --> 04:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
um those areas
 
04:13:47.750 --> 04:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
um are reflected mainly because of the
 
04:13:49.729 --> 04:13:49.739 align:start position:0%
um the bill money that the governor's
 
04:13:51.170 --> 04:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
office allowed us to put in the
 
04:13:54.010 --> 04:13:54.020 align:start position:0%
operating budget this year for 24.25
 
04:13:56.330 --> 04:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
recognizing the fact that that money is
 
04:13:57.469 --> 04:13:57.479 align:start position:0%
going to be coming to this apartment
 
04:14:00.889 --> 04:14:00.899 align:start position:0%
every year for the next five years
 
04:14:03.290 --> 04:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
rather than us going and asking fiscal
 
04:14:05.630 --> 04:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
committee to add all of this money
 
04:14:07.670 --> 04:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
um just so you know Opera money is not
 
04:14:08.870 --> 04:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
in here
 
04:14:11.870 --> 04:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
there's no offer money in here
 
04:14:11.880 --> 04:14:13.969 align:start position:0%
there's no offer money in here
um

04:14:13.969 --> 04:14:13.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:18.290 --> 04:14:18.300 align:start position:0%
and for 24 to 25 we are basically
 
04:14:20.570 --> 04:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
flatlining the budget across the two
 
04:14:20.580 --> 04:14:21.530 align:start position:0%
flatlining the budget across the two
years

04:14:21.530 --> 04:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:14:21.540 --> 04:14:22.910 align:start position:0%
years
yeah

04:14:22.910 --> 04:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:14:25.790 --> 04:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
and as you can see there's an unusual
 
04:14:29.689 --> 04:14:29.699 align:start position:0%
event happening from 24 to 25. loans go
 
04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
down by seven million dollars and
 
04:14:34.429 --> 04:14:34.439 align:start position:0%
contracts go up by 7.7 million
 
04:14:37.250 --> 04:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
the reasons loans goes down by seven
 
04:14:39.590 --> 04:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars is because one of our
 
04:14:42.349 --> 04:14:42.359 align:start position:0%
loan programs is the pfas Loan program
 
04:14:45.710 --> 04:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
we have a maximum budget for loans of 50
 
04:14:49.429 --> 04:14:49.439 align:start position:0%
million dollars we anticipate hitting
 
04:14:53.330 --> 04:14:53.340 align:start position:0%
that maximum amount in fy25
 
04:14:56.150 --> 04:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
we expect to be putting out loans this
 
04:14:59.269 --> 04:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
year and then 24 and we reduce our
 
04:15:01.189 --> 04:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
budget because we were anticipating hit
 
04:15:05.150 --> 04:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
our Max in 24 and 25. contracts on the
 
04:15:07.370 --> 04:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
other hand went up 7.7 million dollars
 
04:15:10.309 --> 04:15:10.319 align:start position:0%
that is primarily sitting in one
 
04:15:13.670 --> 04:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
accounting unit which is our super fund
 
04:15:18.110 --> 04:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
EPA has been able to identify a lot of
 
04:15:19.809 --> 04:15:19.819 align:start position:0%
additional money
 
04:15:22.550 --> 04:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
and is going to be passing that money
 
04:15:25.550 --> 04:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
through to the state to work on current
 
04:15:28.370 --> 04:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
Superfund sites to do pfas remediation
 
04:15:28.380 --> 04:15:29.450 align:start position:0%
Superfund sites to do pfas remediation
work

04:15:29.450 --> 04:15:29.460 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:15:32.030 --> 04:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
we are jumping as you can see the
 
04:15:35.630 --> 04:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
contracts jump 16 million dollars and 20
 
04:15:39.410 --> 04:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
23 to 24 about 6.4 of that is an
 
04:15:41.750 --> 04:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
increase in super fund contracts and
 
04:15:43.490 --> 04:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
then that seven million dollars is a
 
04:15:46.670 --> 04:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
second increase on top of that for even
 
04:15:51.710 --> 04:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
more contract work in 25 for Superfund
 
04:15:51.720 --> 04:15:53.269 align:start position:0%
more contract work in 25 for Superfund
representative

04:15:53.269 --> 04:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:15:57.650 --> 04:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
yeah so we have a bill to add uh like 2
 
04:16:01.010 --> 04:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
million for pfas related things testing
 
04:16:03.530 --> 04:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
and and some other things but you're
 
04:16:06.650 --> 04:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
talking in the tens 30 you know 20
 
04:16:09.349 --> 04:16:09.359 align:start position:0%
million kind of category so is this 2
 
04:16:12.050 --> 04:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
million maybe not not too entirely
 
04:16:14.650 --> 04:16:14.660 align:start position:0%
separate things this is super font size
 
04:16:17.750 --> 04:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
oh okay okay these are just work on
 
04:16:19.309 --> 04:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
super fun sites
 
04:16:21.170 --> 04:16:21.180 align:start position:0%
and this is just for additional
 
04:16:23.450 --> 04:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
remediation work on those Superfund
 
04:16:26.570 --> 04:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
sites is the problem area in Merrimack a
 
04:16:28.750 --> 04:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
Superfund Site
 
04:16:32.330 --> 04:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
no okay so but it might become one or
 
04:16:33.849 --> 04:16:33.859 align:start position:0%
something is this
 
04:16:37.309 --> 04:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
we don't know okay we don't know
 
04:16:40.790 --> 04:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:45.710 --> 04:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
um our next slide on Slide 10.
 
04:16:48.830 --> 04:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
um gives us the same cost broken down by
 
04:16:51.349 --> 04:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
sources of funds so that you can see
 
04:16:55.189 --> 04:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
where our increase in our budget is
 
04:16:58.969 --> 04:16:58.979 align:start position:0%
um we had a um for a general funds we
 
04:17:01.670 --> 04:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
had a 1.3 million dollar increase which
 
04:17:04.670 --> 04:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
is approximately nine percent our srf
 
04:17:07.790 --> 04:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
funds went up 53 million dollars which
 
04:17:11.450 --> 04:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
is 150 percent increase all our other
 
04:17:14.150 --> 04:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
Federal programs went up by nearly 24
 
04:17:16.370 --> 04:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars again nearly a 90
 
04:17:16.380 --> 04:17:18.710 align:start position:0%
million dollars again nearly a 90
increase

04:17:18.710 --> 04:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
increase
 
04:17:21.110 --> 04:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
um our srf repayment funds went up by
 
04:17:23.330 --> 04:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
nine million dollars
 
04:17:25.370 --> 04:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
um our drinking water groundwater trusts
 
04:17:27.290 --> 04:17:27.300 align:start position:0%
went up by approximately two million
 
04:17:29.990 --> 04:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
dollars and then all other funds from
 
04:17:32.330 --> 04:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
all other sources went down slightly by
 
04:17:34.610 --> 04:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
one percent
 
04:17:38.389 --> 04:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
um you can see in from 24 to 25 again
 
04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
the two biggest change areas is federal
 
04:17:44.750 --> 04:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
funds went up by 5 million again in
 
04:17:46.790 --> 04:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
large part because that is reflected of
 
04:17:49.010 --> 04:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
the super fund contract money that is
 
04:17:52.070 --> 04:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
coming through and all other funds went
 
04:17:55.790 --> 04:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
down by 6.3 again that's the pfas loan
 
04:17:57.950 --> 04:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
money that has decreased by seven
 
04:18:00.050 --> 04:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
million dollars offset by operating
 
04:18:05.030 --> 04:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:07.250 --> 04:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:18:09.469 --> 04:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
division members while we're
 
04:18:10.849 --> 04:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
04:18:12.590 --> 04:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
end of budget
 
04:18:14.630 --> 04:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
presentation before we go into house
 
04:18:17.450 --> 04:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
bill two sections any issues
 
04:18:19.910 --> 04:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none must be doing a good job
 
04:18:23.990 --> 04:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
Susan yes we always expect
 
04:18:25.490 --> 04:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
thank you so so again as the chair
 
04:18:27.769 --> 04:18:27.779 align:start position:0%
mentioned so next in our presentation
 
04:18:31.250 --> 04:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about House Bill 2
 
04:18:33.469 --> 04:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
positions and then some of our
 
04:18:35.210 --> 04:18:35.220 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs and our additional
 
04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
asks just to give you a preview uh so if
 
04:18:41.809 --> 04:18:41.819 align:start position:0%
looking at slide 11 uh on House Bill 2
 
04:18:43.969 --> 04:18:43.979 align:start position:0%
uh we tried to call it the things that
 
04:18:48.170 --> 04:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
were more directly involving us so uh in
 
04:18:51.110 --> 04:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
order of what you see on the slide is
 
04:18:51.120 --> 04:18:51.889 align:start position:0%
order of what you see on the slide is
um

04:18:51.889 --> 04:18:51.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
that the first line is referencing some
 
04:18:56.809 --> 04:18:56.819 align:start position:0%
changes we we've asked to have made uh
 
04:18:58.309 --> 04:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
within the organization of the
 
04:18:59.750 --> 04:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office so there's really
 
04:19:04.849 --> 04:19:04.859 align:start position:0%
no budgetary uh impact to that uh the
 
04:19:08.210 --> 04:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
second line has to do with our
 
04:19:10.070 --> 04:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
environmental appeals councils we have
 
04:19:13.429 --> 04:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
four councils that help with rules as
 
04:19:16.370 --> 04:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
well as appeals and chair so I'm going
 
04:19:18.590 --> 04:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
to slow you down a bit because what I do
 
04:19:20.929 --> 04:19:20.939 align:start position:0%
is have the members of the division
 
04:19:23.570 --> 04:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
weigh in on your proposed changes so we
 
04:19:25.729 --> 04:19:25.739 align:start position:0%
can check them off and not have to come
 
04:19:27.469 --> 04:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
back to them if there's a question you
 
04:19:29.769 --> 04:19:29.779 align:start position:0%
won't be here to answer that okay
 
04:19:32.809 --> 04:19:32.819 align:start position:0%
yes represent McGuire so I have that
 
04:19:34.670 --> 04:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
we've checked off everything except
 
04:19:38.090 --> 04:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
section 18 from 1 to 19.
 
04:19:42.229 --> 04:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:44.870 --> 04:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
04:19:49.250 --> 04:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
yeah we we checked off
 
04:19:54.769 --> 04:19:54.779 align:start position:0%
16 no I'm sorry uh 17 and 19 and
 
04:19:58.610 --> 04:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:00.950 --> 04:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
on my page I have checkoffs at one two
 
04:20:03.130 --> 04:20:03.140 align:start position:0%
three oh but those are different yeah
 
04:20:08.090 --> 04:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
I understand so what is 18. 18 was the
 
04:20:11.150 --> 04:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
doj part of it so I I think that section
 
04:20:13.389 --> 04:20:13.399 align:start position:0%
had to do with the
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
rearranging that you're doing with your
 
04:20:18.170 --> 04:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
various councils so we were going to
 
04:20:20.030 --> 04:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
have them just talk to us a little bit
 
04:20:23.210 --> 04:20:23.220 align:start position:0%
about that but 19.
 
04:20:23.220 --> 04:20:24.830 align:start position:0%
about that but 19.
so

04:20:24.830 --> 04:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:20:27.290 --> 04:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
so let's go let's go back to 17 that's
 
04:20:31.010 --> 04:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
everyone okay with 17.
 
04:20:33.530 --> 04:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
okay so that's good
 
04:20:38.030 --> 04:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
so uh now 18. 18 we did checks
 
04:20:43.189 --> 04:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:43.199 --> 04:20:47.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:20:47.650 --> 04:20:47.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:52.130 --> 04:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:56.269 --> 04:20:56.279 align:start position:0%
yeah so 19. oh there it is
 
04:20:56.279 --> 04:20:58.689 align:start position:0%
yeah so 19. oh there it is
yeah

04:20:58.689 --> 04:20:58.699 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:21:06.050 --> 04:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:08.510 --> 04:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
so some of these here was some overlap
 
04:21:10.610 --> 04:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
with like the Department of Justice so
 
04:21:19.849 --> 04:21:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:21.830 --> 04:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
helpful is there are several sections
 
04:21:24.110 --> 04:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
here one applies to waste management
 
04:21:25.969 --> 04:21:25.979 align:start position:0%
Council one applies to water and one
 
04:21:27.710 --> 04:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
applies to air why don't you just sort
 
04:21:30.950 --> 04:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
of describe your overall thought here
 
04:21:34.370 --> 04:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
sure there are multiple sections so so
 
04:21:36.410 --> 04:21:36.420 align:start position:0%
the doj part of it maybe I can start
 
04:21:38.389 --> 04:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
with that so right now the councils are
 
04:21:41.210 --> 04:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the to the
 
04:21:43.790 --> 04:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
agency but they hear appeals of the
 
04:21:46.550 --> 04:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
agency's permit so one one issue we
 
04:21:49.250 --> 04:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
would like to we were attempting within
 
04:21:51.889 --> 04:21:51.899 align:start position:0%
hp2 to accomplish is to provide some
 
04:21:54.769 --> 04:21:54.779 align:start position:0%
distance uh certainly for the Optics of
 
04:21:58.070 --> 04:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
it if you will that we're not the people
 
04:22:00.530 --> 04:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
who are supporting the council's work
 
04:22:02.090 --> 04:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
for me right now
 
04:22:04.490 --> 04:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
and the councils are judging whether the
 
04:22:06.710 --> 04:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
the permits that went under my name or
 
04:22:09.530 --> 04:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
are okay or not so the Optics in my
 
04:22:11.210 --> 04:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
opinion are not really
 
04:22:13.250 --> 04:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
great for the public you know we can say
 
04:22:15.290 --> 04:22:15.300 align:start position:0%
yes there's a dotted line and we have a
 
04:22:17.630 --> 04:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
Chinese wall Etc all we want but I think
 
04:22:21.290 --> 04:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
that's not ideal so we're trying to and
 
04:22:23.210 --> 04:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
I think the Attorney General meta
 
04:22:24.410 --> 04:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
mentioned to this yesterday I talked to
 
04:22:27.170 --> 04:22:27.180 align:start position:0%
him this morning again about it uh
 
04:22:28.790 --> 04:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
it will have been asked for a technical
 
04:22:30.769 --> 04:22:30.779 align:start position:0%
correction later on in our presentation
 
04:22:34.309 --> 04:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
but the desire was to move that
 
04:22:36.290 --> 04:22:36.300 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the Attorney General's
 
04:22:38.809 --> 04:22:38.819 align:start position:0%
office to give you a preview we also
 
04:22:40.189 --> 04:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
want to move a position within the
 
04:22:42.769 --> 04:22:42.779 align:start position:0%
agency as a technical correction that
 
04:22:45.410 --> 04:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
currently supports the councils to the
 
04:22:48.229 --> 04:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice so I guess I it's
 
04:22:49.550 --> 04:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
not much of a preview I gave you the
 
04:22:52.670 --> 04:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
whole whole show uh on that end so so
 
04:22:55.130 --> 04:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
that was kind of the the doj part of
 
04:22:58.790 --> 04:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
that uh that crossover uh the other
 
04:23:00.830 --> 04:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
desire was we had been tasked to look at
 
04:23:03.469 --> 04:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
our whole permitting process from start
 
04:23:05.929 --> 04:23:05.939 align:start position:0%
through appeals and look for ways to
 
04:23:09.189 --> 04:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
streamline and so some of that language
 
04:23:11.809 --> 04:23:11.819 align:start position:0%
as representative evil mentioned that it
 
04:23:13.610 --> 04:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
goes Council by Council but it's really
 
04:23:16.010 --> 04:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
the same the intent would be right
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
currently the Department of Justice uh
 
04:23:21.530 --> 04:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
will appoint a hearing officer for uh
 
04:23:24.410 --> 04:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
Council appeals and they look at the
 
04:23:27.110 --> 04:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
legality of the aspects and then they
 
04:23:30.110 --> 04:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
they convene the councils uh once they
 
04:23:33.650 --> 04:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
get a quorum and they they adjudicate
 
04:23:37.610 --> 04:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
the the appeals uh they're some
 
04:23:39.110 --> 04:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
efficiencies in our opinion that be
 
04:23:41.030 --> 04:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
gained by
 
04:23:41.040 --> 04:23:41.769 align:start position:0%
gained by
um

04:23:41.769 --> 04:23:41.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:44.030 --> 04:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of this is just a legal
 
04:23:45.889 --> 04:23:45.899 align:start position:0%
interpretation so
 
04:23:48.410 --> 04:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
what we want to do is is streamline the
 
04:23:50.150 --> 04:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
process but get the best of both worlds
 
04:23:52.969 --> 04:23:52.979 align:start position:0%
so the intent in the hp2 is our is
 
04:23:54.950 --> 04:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
another in front of me but as I remember
 
04:23:59.210 --> 04:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
it is to allow for the hearing officer
 
04:24:01.130 --> 04:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
to have more
 
04:24:02.990 --> 04:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
the ultimate decision making but be
 
04:24:05.150 --> 04:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
guided by the councils and the other
 
04:24:07.010 --> 04:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
part of that is because the councils
 
04:24:08.689 --> 04:24:08.699 align:start position:0%
often have
 
04:24:11.870 --> 04:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
their volunteers uh understandably uh
 
04:24:13.790 --> 04:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
getting getting Quorum is sometimes
 
04:24:16.189 --> 04:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
difficult and we've seen some delays in
 
04:24:19.550 --> 04:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
getting permitting appeal decisions done
 
04:24:23.330 --> 04:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
is to reduce the Quorum that's needed to
 
04:24:26.570 --> 04:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
advise the hearing officers so that all
 
04:24:28.490 --> 04:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
all said is what the attempt is is to
 
04:24:30.410 --> 04:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
allow the council still to have input
 
04:24:33.110 --> 04:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
but to help help move the process along
 
04:24:34.550 --> 04:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
a little bit quicker so that's the
 
04:24:37.189 --> 04:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
attempt but the budgetary impacts are
 
04:24:40.550 --> 04:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
really the Department of Justice would
 
04:24:42.889 --> 04:24:42.899 align:start position:0%
would take over instead of the dotted
 
04:24:44.150 --> 04:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
line for us it would be them
 
04:24:45.769 --> 04:24:45.779 align:start position:0%
administering that
 
04:24:49.309 --> 04:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:52.309 --> 04:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
any issues there folks
 
04:24:55.550 --> 04:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
I would support that we include this in
 
04:24:59.210 --> 04:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
hb2 so it's 19 to 26 those are the
 
04:24:59.220 --> 04:25:01.670 align:start position:0%
hb2 so it's 19 to 26 those are the
sections

04:25:01.670 --> 04:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
sections
 
04:25:04.729 --> 04:25:04.739 align:start position:0%
19 through 26
 
04:25:08.349 --> 04:25:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:12.309 --> 04:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
no but seeing none will check those off
 
04:25:15.110 --> 04:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
Melissa and Mr Hoffman
 
04:25:17.870 --> 04:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
so actually starting at 17 and going
 
04:25:22.630 --> 04:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:29.030 --> 04:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:31.670 --> 04:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
right into the wetlands so so going back
 
04:25:34.610 --> 04:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
last biennium so we have uh multiple
 
04:25:36.170 --> 04:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
programs under our land resource
 
04:25:40.870 --> 04:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
management uh Bureau uh and we we merged
 
04:25:44.210 --> 04:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
uh wetlands and sherlin Shoreland fees
 
04:25:47.149 --> 04:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
last year into the same account and we
 
04:25:48.769 --> 04:25:48.779 align:start position:0%
basically were asking to complete that
 
04:25:50.630 --> 04:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
we also want to add alteration and
 
04:25:52.370 --> 04:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
training fees into the same account to
 
04:25:53.630 --> 04:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
give a little bit more flexibility for
 
04:25:56.510 --> 04:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
the programs to operate absolutely
 
04:25:59.030 --> 04:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
oh it's just sub Circle oh I'm sorry I I
 
04:26:01.490 --> 04:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
get the wrong programs aot was last year
 
04:26:03.649 --> 04:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
we liked subsurface to be added to that
 
04:26:06.290 --> 04:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
I had the wrong program I apologize
 
04:26:07.969 --> 04:26:07.979 align:start position:0%
that's why I have Sue sitting next to me
 
04:26:14.149 --> 04:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:17.809 --> 04:26:17.819 align:start position:0%
okay any questions representative evil
 
04:26:20.149 --> 04:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
um I think we should make the changes
 
04:26:25.070 --> 04:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
recommended in HB to the 27 to 31 second
 
04:26:27.530 --> 04:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
let me uh represent Maguire is a
 
04:26:30.530 --> 04:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
question yeah so um like in section 29
 
04:26:33.590 --> 04:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
and and others you're adding to the
 
04:26:36.530 --> 04:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
funds that are non-lapsing the words and
 
04:26:38.990 --> 04:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
continuously appropriated which you put
 
04:26:39.000 --> 04:26:41.570 align:start position:0%
continuously appropriated which you put
significance

04:26:41.570 --> 04:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:43.790 --> 04:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
um continuously appropriately allows us
 
04:26:46.790 --> 04:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
to make necessary budget budgetary
 
04:26:50.389 --> 04:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
changes if needed without having
 
04:26:52.849 --> 04:26:52.859 align:start position:0%
um to go before either Governor Council
 
04:26:54.710 --> 04:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
or Facebook committee for the small
 
04:26:56.689 --> 04:26:56.699 align:start position:0%
changes that we need
 
04:26:59.149 --> 04:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
it it is
 
04:27:01.429 --> 04:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the Water Resources
 
04:27:05.389 --> 04:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
fund as established all the sections
 
04:27:07.130 --> 04:27:07.140 align:start position:0%
have the continuously appropriated
 
04:27:09.110 --> 04:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
language in there so we wanted
 
04:27:12.590 --> 04:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
consistency with all the rest of these
 
04:27:15.110 --> 04:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
to have that same Authority
 
04:27:17.090 --> 04:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
is there some dollar amount that where
 
04:27:18.710 --> 04:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
you would go to the fiscal committee
 
04:27:20.210 --> 04:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
instead or not
 
04:27:23.030 --> 04:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
no no in all honesty no
 
04:27:26.090 --> 04:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
but we um we don't these
 
04:27:28.250 --> 04:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
these programs we don't run with big
 
04:27:31.490 --> 04:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
changes it just allows us if there is a
 
04:27:33.290 --> 04:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
changes that we absolutely have to make
 
04:27:36.590 --> 04:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
like on rent or utilities or other
 
04:27:38.870 --> 04:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
things that we can do this
 
04:27:41.689 --> 04:27:41.699 align:start position:0%
yeah most of our other fee programs have
 
04:27:45.050 --> 04:27:45.060 align:start position:0%
the standard language okay thank you
 
04:27:48.170 --> 04:27:48.180 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:27:52.130 --> 04:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:55.809 --> 04:27:55.819 align:start position:0%
representative evil you okay
 
04:28:00.229 --> 04:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
so we're all set with 27 to
 
04:28:02.689 --> 04:28:02.699 align:start position:0%
30 actually
 
04:28:07.030 --> 04:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:10.510 --> 04:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
27 to 31.
 
04:28:15.170 --> 04:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
everybody's to 30. 30 and then 31 is a
 
04:28:20.389 --> 04:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:22.490 --> 04:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
that one's all right with me thinking
 
04:28:25.729 --> 04:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:28.490 --> 04:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
so I'm just going to back up if I could
 
04:28:31.550 --> 04:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
Susan to represent a McGuire's question
 
04:28:34.309 --> 04:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
about the continuously appropriate you
 
04:28:37.189 --> 04:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
said it's a small amount what do you
 
04:28:40.370 --> 04:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:42.950 --> 04:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
well my definition of small has grown
 
04:28:47.570 --> 04:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:50.929 --> 04:28:50.939 align:start position:0%
um generally these are our changes are
 
04:28:53.510 --> 04:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
are realignments of funds and we're
 
04:28:57.530 --> 04:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
generally we stay you know
 
04:29:00.410 --> 04:29:00.420 align:start position:0%
we range anywhere from seven hundred
 
04:29:02.870 --> 04:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
dollars to maybe twenty twenty five
 
04:29:06.170 --> 04:29:06.180 align:start position:0%
thousand Max most of the changes we ask
 
04:29:08.689 --> 04:29:08.699 align:start position:0%
um most of every one of our funds has
 
04:29:10.610 --> 04:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
this continually appropriated language
 
04:29:11.809 --> 04:29:11.819 align:start position:0%
in it
 
04:29:14.090 --> 04:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
um and it just allows us to to fix
 
04:29:16.130 --> 04:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
things as we need them
 
04:29:19.849 --> 04:29:19.859 align:start position:0%
um but for the most part I try not to
 
04:29:22.370 --> 04:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
let people use this unless they
 
04:29:24.170 --> 04:29:24.180 align:start position:0%
absolutely less programs absolutely need
 
04:29:24.180 --> 04:29:25.849 align:start position:0%
absolutely less programs absolutely need
it

04:29:25.849 --> 04:29:25.859 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:29:28.189 --> 04:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
um the if you ask the staff in the
 
04:29:29.990 --> 04:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
department the program staff I'm a bit
 
04:29:32.689 --> 04:29:32.699 align:start position:0%
of a penny pincher with them so we only
 
04:29:37.729 --> 04:29:37.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:43.070 --> 04:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
all right so okay so so we're up to 31
 
04:29:45.769 --> 04:29:45.779 align:start position:0%
that just had a deadline that's good
 
04:29:45.779 --> 04:29:51.050 align:start position:0%
that just had a deadline that's good
yeah

04:29:51.050 --> 04:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:55.070 --> 04:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:55.080 --> 04:29:57.590 align:start position:0%
 
34.

04:29:57.590 --> 04:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
34.
 
04:30:00.189 --> 04:30:00.199 align:start position:0%
32 looks like big thoughts yeah
 
04:30:04.729 --> 04:30:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:07.010 --> 04:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
04:30:10.070 --> 04:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
yes Mr Hoffman this lines up with that
 
04:30:12.370 --> 04:30:12.380 align:start position:0%
house bill 311
 
04:30:17.050 --> 04:30:17.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:19.370 --> 04:30:19.380 align:start position:0%
in the trailer build we're not in
 
04:30:19.380 --> 04:30:21.229 align:start position:0%
in the trailer build we're not in
hospital

04:30:21.229 --> 04:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
04:30:24.830 --> 04:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's Tom bucco boxes
 
04:30:27.229 --> 04:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
some people call it I'm glad to see
 
04:30:29.090 --> 04:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
actually put it in so representative
 
04:30:31.790 --> 04:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
Buco didn't have to fight as he has for
 
04:30:31.800 --> 04:30:34.189 align:start position:0%
Buco didn't have to fight as he has for
decades

04:30:34.189 --> 04:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
decades
 
04:30:37.010 --> 04:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
so we're okay with that I believe right
 
04:30:37.020 --> 04:30:40.729 align:start position:0%
so we're okay with that I believe right
okay

04:30:40.729 --> 04:30:40.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:40.739 --> 04:30:42.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:30:42.830 --> 04:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:30:42.840 --> 04:30:45.530 align:start position:0%
so
34

04:30:45.530 --> 04:30:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:45.540 --> 04:30:46.570 align:start position:0%
 
.

04:30:46.570 --> 04:30:46.580 align:start position:0%
.
 
04:30:54.889 --> 04:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:56.149 --> 04:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
if it helps the community I could
 
04:30:58.670 --> 04:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
describe that real quick so so this is
 
04:31:00.590 --> 04:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
again uh
 
04:31:03.710 --> 04:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
we we charge on a application fee for
 
04:31:05.450 --> 04:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
many of our permits in this case is for
 
04:31:08.510 --> 04:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
alteration of terrain and this would
 
04:31:10.849 --> 04:31:10.859 align:start position:0%
clarify right now if somebody comes in
 
04:31:13.969 --> 04:31:13.979 align:start position:0%
with the amendment so it was unclear
 
04:31:16.849 --> 04:31:16.859 align:start position:0%
that applicants uh whether they had to
 
04:31:20.689 --> 04:31:20.699 align:start position:0%
pay additional fees for as if they were
 
04:31:22.729 --> 04:31:22.739 align:start position:0%
starting from scratch if they had an
 
04:31:24.769 --> 04:31:24.779 align:start position:0%
amendment which is kind of the the plain
 
04:31:27.349 --> 04:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
language or the the current statute
 
04:31:29.510 --> 04:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
Our intention is they would pay an
 
04:31:31.510 --> 04:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
additional fee based on the additional
 
04:31:34.729 --> 04:31:34.739 align:start position:0%
impacted land that they are are being
 
04:31:37.130 --> 04:31:37.140 align:start position:0%
charged for so for so this will actually
 
04:31:39.950 --> 04:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
save applicants money uh but that was
 
04:31:41.510 --> 04:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
always our intent anyway so it's really
 
04:31:43.910 --> 04:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
a clarification
 
04:31:45.889 --> 04:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
so is that the hundred thousand square
 
04:31:45.899 --> 04:31:47.570 align:start position:0%
so is that the hundred thousand square
what

04:31:47.570 --> 04:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
yes or Surface disruption and this again
 
04:31:52.790 --> 04:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
this is only meant to the application
 
04:31:55.070 --> 04:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
amendment fee is only meant to impact
 
04:31:57.229 --> 04:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
the amount you're amending your project
 
04:31:59.750 --> 04:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
by not the whole starting from scratch
 
04:32:02.330 --> 04:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
the whole project again so all right so
 
04:32:04.370 --> 04:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
also you're not paying the 500 again
 
04:32:07.910 --> 04:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
right is that the idea you're adding a
 
04:32:09.710 --> 04:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
thousand feet so it's another hundred
 
04:32:12.290 --> 04:32:12.300 align:start position:0%
but not yeah something like that yeah
 
04:32:12.300 --> 04:32:14.030 align:start position:0%
but not yeah something like that yeah
okay

04:32:14.030 --> 04:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:32:15.889 --> 04:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
so representative McGuire is good with
 
04:32:20.389 --> 04:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:28.969 --> 04:32:28.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:31.189 --> 04:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
can you describe it
 
04:32:33.649 --> 04:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
now you're probably easier for you to
 
04:32:36.229 --> 04:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
describe yes I guess our reading is good
 
04:32:38.630 --> 04:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
so this has to do with the Winnipesaukee
 
04:32:41.149 --> 04:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
River Basin and this goes this language
 
04:32:45.889 --> 04:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
goes back to 1986 uh and it limits the
 
04:32:48.410 --> 04:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
barring ability of the municipalities to
 
04:32:51.590 --> 04:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
support the Winnipesaukee River Basin uh
 
04:32:55.070 --> 04:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
to three million dollars a year uh
 
04:32:56.809 --> 04:32:56.819 align:start position:0%
that's historically been overwritten by
 
04:32:59.210 --> 04:32:59.220 align:start position:0%
Capital budgets anyways I'll say two
 
04:33:01.490 --> 04:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
points to that one is obviously three
 
04:33:03.889 --> 04:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
million dollars in 1986 is not three
 
04:33:05.990 --> 04:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars today it doesn't buy
 
04:33:08.750 --> 04:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
nearly as much today and second of all
 
04:33:10.849 --> 04:33:10.859 align:start position:0%
as a practical matter and Sue can
 
04:33:11.810 --> 04:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
correct me
 
04:33:13.789 --> 04:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
it doesn't operate that way in practice
 
04:33:16.490 --> 04:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
any anymore anyways if it ever did in
 
04:33:20.090 --> 04:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
that we bond for the state and the
 
04:33:22.369 --> 04:33:22.379 align:start position:0%
municipalities the 10 uh municipalities
 
04:33:25.070 --> 04:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
that are involved uh pay for their fees
 
04:33:28.490 --> 04:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
so this is really not doesn't help this
 
04:33:30.590 --> 04:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
being in this language being in so we're
 
04:33:31.970 --> 04:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
being asked for that to be taking out
 
04:33:37.250 --> 04:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:39.470 --> 04:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
all right everybody represent McGuire
 
04:33:42.709 --> 04:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
should there maybe be a new limit
 
04:33:45.410 --> 04:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
because this sort of says unlimited
 
04:33:48.529 --> 04:33:48.539 align:start position:0%
borrowing right well the the way it
 
04:33:51.109 --> 04:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
works when prasaki River Basin as state
 
04:33:54.769 --> 04:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
agency we come into the house and the
 
04:33:54.779 --> 04:33:55.670 align:start position:0%
agency we come into the house and the
Senate

04:33:55.670 --> 04:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
04:33:57.890 --> 04:33:57.900 align:start position:0%
um capital budget committees with a
 
04:34:00.349 --> 04:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
capital budget request that gets
 
04:34:02.689 --> 04:34:02.699 align:start position:0%
approved by the legislature
 
04:34:05.570 --> 04:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
um and that's our bonding Authority
 
04:34:07.970 --> 04:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
um to do this what the commissioner was
 
04:34:09.890 --> 04:34:09.900 align:start position:0%
saying with the 10 communities is what
 
04:34:11.449 --> 04:34:11.459 align:start position:0%
happens is
 
04:34:14.269 --> 04:34:14.279 align:start position:0%
we expand the capital money is we go
 
04:34:16.789 --> 04:34:16.799 align:start position:0%
into repayment because
 
04:34:18.410 --> 04:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
um and then the 10 communities is part
 
04:34:19.789 --> 04:34:19.799 align:start position:0%
of their annual assessment will pay
 
04:34:21.289 --> 04:34:21.299 align:start position:0%
their proportional share of any Debt
 
04:34:21.299 --> 04:34:25.789 align:start position:0%
their proportional share of any Debt
Service

04:34:25.789 --> 04:34:25.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:28.789 --> 04:34:28.799 align:start position:0%
and and just so you know we we
 
04:34:31.070 --> 04:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
um routinely meet with the 10 member
 
04:34:33.349 --> 04:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
committees they form an advisory Council
 
04:34:35.929 --> 04:34:35.939 align:start position:0%
or Advisory Board
 
04:34:38.810 --> 04:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
um and we clear any Capital requests
 
04:34:40.849 --> 04:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
that we tend to make with them before we
 
04:34:43.310 --> 04:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
submit anything to the legislature but
 
04:34:44.929 --> 04:34:44.939 align:start position:0%
you're directed to do that by some other
 
04:34:47.810 --> 04:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
section of law
 
04:34:50.150 --> 04:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
or is that just no we do that as a
 
04:34:52.670 --> 04:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
matter of course
 
04:34:55.310 --> 04:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
so I mean there is an Advisory board
 
04:34:57.470 --> 04:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
that we do meet with but we make an
 
04:34:59.209 --> 04:34:59.219 align:start position:0%
extra effort to make sure that they are
 
04:35:02.810 --> 04:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
on board before we ever expend a lot of
 
04:35:05.510 --> 04:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
money on capital projects
 
04:35:09.590 --> 04:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
so how many users use that state waste
 
04:35:11.449 --> 04:35:11.459 align:start position:0%
what a treatment plan I know it's a huge
 
04:35:26.390 --> 04:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:28.250 --> 04:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
and as far as
 
04:35:47.269 --> 04:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:50.029 --> 04:35:50.039 align:start position:0%
okay Mission are you and perhaps Remain
 
04:35:51.289 --> 04:35:51.299 align:start position:0%
the future
 
04:35:53.390 --> 04:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
discussion on a future slide too just to
 
04:35:55.970 --> 04:35:55.980 align:start position:0%
remind the the committee uh obviously
 
04:35:57.590 --> 04:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
where Kanye Center rate payer money here
 
04:35:59.209 --> 04:35:59.219 align:start position:0%
but there's no General funds associated
 
04:36:00.890 --> 04:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
with this this is totally supported by
 
04:36:03.010 --> 04:36:03.020 align:start position:0%
the member communities
 
04:36:06.830 --> 04:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure all of us know what this is
 
04:36:09.109 --> 04:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
It's a wastewater treatment plant that
 
04:36:11.810 --> 04:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
sure so thank you for that so I I think
 
04:36:14.330 --> 04:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
we're unique in the nation so the so
 
04:36:16.369 --> 04:36:16.379 align:start position:0%
there's the Winnipesaukee River Basin
 
04:36:19.429 --> 04:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
project uh was was a is a wastewater
 
04:36:21.470 --> 04:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
treatment facility with collection lines
 
04:36:24.289 --> 04:36:24.299 align:start position:0%
and pumping stations uh there's a
 
04:36:27.709 --> 04:36:27.719 align:start position:0%
station in uh Laconia uh and and the
 
04:36:29.390 --> 04:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
main treatment facilities in Franklin
 
04:36:32.689 --> 04:36:32.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh and we we basically
 
04:36:35.090 --> 04:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
treat sewage for those communities in in
 
04:36:38.029 --> 04:36:38.039 align:start position:0%
those 10 communities in that area
 
04:36:40.070 --> 04:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
um so I think we're pretty unique
 
04:36:42.410 --> 04:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
because my understanding is so so that's
 
04:36:44.510 --> 04:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
owned and operated by the state Des
 
04:36:48.109 --> 04:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
staff uh run run the facility and as
 
04:36:50.209 --> 04:36:50.219 align:start position:0%
alluded to uh there's an Advisory Board
 
04:36:53.330 --> 04:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
of the member communities uh the the
 
04:36:57.170 --> 04:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
expenses for it for in uh for the the
 
04:36:58.429 --> 04:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
project or the waste right treatment
 
04:37:01.551 --> 04:37:01.561 align:start position:0%
facilities are paid for by user fees for
 
04:37:03.830 --> 04:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
for those 10 communities
 
04:37:07.250 --> 04:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
and again the intent is you know I I
 
04:37:08.750 --> 04:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
don't go back that far but Randy
 
04:37:10.970 --> 04:37:10.980 align:start position:0%
Pelletier does uh that was a slam at him
 
04:37:13.131 --> 04:37:13.141 align:start position:0%
I guess uh is is you know this was
 
04:37:15.529 --> 04:37:15.539 align:start position:0%
originally intended to reduce uh water
 
04:37:17.449 --> 04:37:17.459 align:start position:0%
impacts for Lake Winnipesaukee in that
 
04:37:21.470 --> 04:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:24.289 --> 04:37:24.299 align:start position:0%
all right see no further questions on
 
04:37:25.689 --> 04:37:25.699 align:start position:0%
this we can
 
04:37:29.209 --> 04:37:29.219 align:start position:0%
check this one oh did you have represent
 
04:37:29.219 --> 04:37:30.670 align:start position:0%
check this one oh did you have represent
why

04:37:30.670 --> 04:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:37:32.631 --> 04:37:32.641 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire would like to see
 
04:37:35.390 --> 04:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
a lemon I believe yeah I mean 30 million
 
04:37:37.609 --> 04:37:37.619 align:start position:0%
or something I mean I don't know
 
04:37:40.029 --> 04:37:40.039 align:start position:0%
when this paragraph was first written
 
04:37:42.410 --> 04:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
whoever wrote it thought that the limit
 
04:37:44.750 --> 04:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
meant something
 
04:37:44.760 --> 04:37:49.310 align:start position:0%
meant something
um

04:37:49.310 --> 04:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:51.529 --> 04:37:51.539 align:start position:0%
30 million that's fine it's just at this
 
04:37:54.590 --> 04:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
point none of the communities are and
 
04:37:57.289 --> 04:37:57.299 align:start position:0%
even this agency understands why the
 
04:37:59.631 --> 04:37:59.641 align:start position:0%
limit was set at three million dollars
 
04:38:02.330 --> 04:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
it's it's an Antiquated dollar amount
 
04:38:04.929 --> 04:38:04.939 align:start position:0%
and we're just trying to
 
04:38:08.209 --> 04:38:08.219 align:start position:0%
adjust the statute so that I mean are
 
04:38:10.189 --> 04:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
you bumping against this limit is that
 
04:38:15.070 --> 04:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:17.510 --> 04:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Pelletier if you could grab a
 
04:38:23.929 --> 04:38:23.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:23.939 --> 04:38:28.570 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:38:28.570 --> 04:38:28.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:31.810 --> 04:38:31.820 align:start position:0%
I I think to answer that question uh
 
04:38:35.029 --> 04:38:35.039 align:start position:0%
representative there's uh pipelines are
 
04:38:38.330 --> 04:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
bursting in Berlin the 140 Route just to
 
04:38:40.131 --> 04:38:40.141 align:start position:0%
replace that pipeline six and a half
 
04:38:41.449 --> 04:38:41.459 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
04:38:45.051 --> 04:38:45.061 align:start position:0%
it used to be when I was younger we
 
04:38:46.970 --> 04:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
could put in a mile of pipeline for
 
04:38:51.349 --> 04:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 850 to 900 000 today to
 
04:38:53.029 --> 04:38:53.039 align:start position:0%
put in a mile of pipeline is well over
 
04:38:56.090 --> 04:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
two million so when you look at
 
04:38:58.369 --> 04:38:58.379 align:start position:0%
infrastructure improvements for not only
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
this plant but I Wastewater plants all
 
04:39:03.590 --> 04:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
over the state the like Portsmouth just
 
04:39:06.949 --> 04:39:06.959 align:start position:0%
completed their upgrade 87 million
 
04:39:10.369 --> 04:39:10.379 align:start position:0%
I mean so the when you start to cap an
 
04:39:12.051 --> 04:39:12.061 align:start position:0%
issue and let's say we had multiple
 
04:39:14.570 --> 04:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
failures at Winnipesaukee River if we
 
04:39:16.670 --> 04:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
had to clarifier go down or we had a
 
04:39:19.490 --> 04:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
major pipeline leak that could easily
 
04:39:22.250 --> 04:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
get into a 10 million dollar ticket but
 
04:39:24.051 --> 04:39:24.061 align:start position:0%
I also want to note that because I meet
 
04:39:26.570 --> 04:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
with the Advisory Board every month and
 
04:39:28.609 --> 04:39:28.619 align:start position:0%
they do have a 10-year Capital
 
04:39:31.490 --> 04:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
Improvements plan so anytime a project
 
04:39:35.209 --> 04:39:35.219 align:start position:0%
comes before to be bonded it's approved
 
04:39:38.690 --> 04:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
by this 10-member Advisory board so it's
 
04:39:44.750 --> 04:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:47.448 --> 04:39:47.458 align:start position:0%
good reason there was limit put on it
 
04:39:50.090 --> 04:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
and I think he suggested what 30 million
 
04:39:55.250 --> 04:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah at least may call attention
 
04:39:56.868 --> 04:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
04:39:59.510 --> 04:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
is that right yeah okay representative
 
04:40:02.270 --> 04:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
Kimbrell's thank you Mr chair so what is
 
04:40:04.788 --> 04:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
currently with that language that is in
 
04:40:06.650 --> 04:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
there now how did that affect you
 
04:40:11.150 --> 04:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:13.788 --> 04:40:13.798 align:start position:0%
uh stop the department from
 
04:40:15.948 --> 04:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
so whether we put 30 million or 100
 
04:40:18.470 --> 04:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
million it doesn't matter anyway
 
04:40:20.770 --> 04:40:20.780 align:start position:0%
so I don't know
 
04:40:23.208 --> 04:40:23.218 align:start position:0%
and to add on to that so again as I
 
04:40:25.430 --> 04:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned is this historically is
 
04:40:27.410 --> 04:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
overridden but this this limit is
 
04:40:29.810 --> 04:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
overridden by the capital budget so so
 
04:40:31.970 --> 04:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
you know I won't say you you're a
 
04:40:33.530 --> 04:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
different committee but but they put
 
04:40:35.570 --> 04:40:35.580 align:start position:0%
language in the capital budget to say
 
04:40:38.810 --> 04:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
correct I see I see okay but at least it
 
04:40:40.730 --> 04:40:40.740 align:start position:0%
has to be overridden by somebody if
 
04:40:42.288 --> 04:40:42.298 align:start position:0%
there's no limit there it doesn't have
 
04:40:44.570 --> 04:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
to be overridden by anybody yeah
 
04:40:47.510 --> 04:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
all right so can I move the the we
 
04:40:47.520 --> 04:40:48.250 align:start position:0%
all right so can I move the the we
change

04:40:48.250 --> 04:40:48.260 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:40:51.288 --> 04:40:51.298 align:start position:0%
change section 35 so it keeps the
 
04:40:53.750 --> 04:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
language but changes three million to 30
 
04:40:57.350 --> 04:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
million it's been moved is it second is
 
04:40:59.630 --> 04:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded by uh
 
04:40:59.640 --> 04:41:01.430 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded by uh
representative

04:41:01.430 --> 04:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:41:04.130 --> 04:41:04.140 align:start position:0%
Dave Hewitt is there any further
 
04:41:06.288 --> 04:41:06.298 align:start position:0%
discussion I'm bringing the limit to 30
 
04:41:09.590 --> 04:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
million seeing none just to show it
 
04:41:11.810 --> 04:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
hands please
 
04:41:17.030 --> 04:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:27.708 --> 04:41:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:34.850 --> 04:41:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:34.860 --> 04:41:37.910 align:start position:0%
 
commissionary

04:41:37.910 --> 04:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:39.530 --> 04:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
X I'm going to let Sue Carlson do this
 
04:41:41.690 --> 04:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
she'll do a little bit better but really
 
04:41:45.050 --> 04:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
right now the the law requires a certain
 
04:41:48.110 --> 04:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
date for issuance date specific of
 
04:41:50.750 --> 04:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
issuance of quarterly bills again we the
 
04:41:52.610 --> 04:41:52.620 align:start position:0%
rate payers from those communities pay
 
04:41:54.708 --> 04:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
for that and we want a little bit more
 
04:41:57.350 --> 04:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
flexibility than that so we can add to
 
04:41:59.930 --> 04:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
that yeah what
 
04:42:01.730 --> 04:42:01.740 align:start position:0%
um the current law says we are supposed
 
04:42:03.770 --> 04:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
to issue the bills on the July 15th
 
04:42:07.430 --> 04:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
October 15th January and April 15th
 
04:42:10.850 --> 04:42:10.860 align:start position:0%
um it is nion impossible for us to issue
 
04:42:13.970 --> 04:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
bills especially on July 15th
 
04:42:15.590 --> 04:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
um mainly because we can't even close
 
04:42:18.050 --> 04:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
the books by July 15th in order to send
 
04:42:20.150 --> 04:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
the next Bills out so we were just
 
04:42:21.948 --> 04:42:21.958 align:start position:0%
looking to maintain the quarterly
 
04:42:24.230 --> 04:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
billing but just remove those action set
 
04:42:26.868 --> 04:42:26.878 align:start position:0%
dates where was that Maguire no problem
 
04:42:26.878 --> 04:42:31.910 align:start position:0%
dates where was that Maguire no problem
yeah

04:42:31.910 --> 04:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:33.350 --> 04:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:42:33.360 --> 04:42:34.208 align:start position:0%
all right
um

04:42:34.208 --> 04:42:34.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:38.750 --> 04:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:38.760 --> 04:42:41.150 align:start position:0%
 
PCB

04:42:41.150 --> 04:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
PCB
 
04:42:44.990 --> 04:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
so if I could so the the PCB fund that
 
04:42:47.090 --> 04:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
this would establish so I'll go back in
 
04:42:51.050 --> 04:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
time a little bit so uh this the funds
 
04:42:53.510 --> 04:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
that went to the general fund uh stem
 
04:42:57.050 --> 04:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
from a a settlement that the doj was
 
04:42:59.810 --> 04:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
able to work with Monsanto uh The
 
04:43:02.270 --> 04:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
Chemical Corporation for contamination
 
04:43:05.930 --> 04:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
in different parts of the State uh so
 
04:43:07.550 --> 04:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
you know right or wrong depending on
 
04:43:09.770 --> 04:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
your point of view typically the the
 
04:43:11.750 --> 04:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice would try to
 
04:43:15.530 --> 04:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
Target a where this money goes uh they
 
04:43:17.690 --> 04:43:17.700 align:start position:0%
the settlement happened so quickly they
 
04:43:19.430 --> 04:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
it just went to the general fund which I
 
04:43:21.948 --> 04:43:21.958 align:start position:0%
think is fine and and the the amount
 
04:43:23.930 --> 04:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
that went to the general fund was I
 
04:43:25.788 --> 04:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
think 20 million Mike wimp said it's
 
04:43:27.230 --> 04:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
gonna either
 
04:43:29.330 --> 04:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
not his head or shake his head behind me
 
04:43:33.910 --> 04:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
he's going both wins is this the MTB no
 
04:43:37.550 --> 04:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
it is PCP so so I started I say that
 
04:43:39.110 --> 04:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
because if I remember correctly 25
 
04:43:44.030 --> 04:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
million was was what was was uh that was
 
04:43:47.208 --> 04:43:47.218 align:start position:0%
was he agreed upon monies and we had the
 
04:43:48.770 --> 04:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
state had to pay off their their
 
04:43:51.890 --> 04:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
external attorneys Etc and then the rest
 
04:43:55.010 --> 04:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
went into the uh general fund so the
 
04:43:57.410 --> 04:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
intent was always that some of these
 
04:44:00.470 --> 04:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
funds would go towards some mediation
 
04:44:03.350 --> 04:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
and other work for pcbs and this is an
 
04:44:05.270 --> 04:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
attempt to do that so again a majority
 
04:44:06.170 --> 04:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
of this is still going to the general
 
04:44:08.690 --> 04:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
fund but we're asking for for this
 
04:44:11.810 --> 04:44:11.820 align:start position:0%
amount to to go towards some a fund that
 
04:44:13.070 --> 04:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
we could use towards cleanup and
 
04:44:16.730 --> 04:44:16.740 align:start position:0%
Associated things with PCB contamination
 
04:44:20.208 --> 04:44:20.218 align:start position:0%
is PCB still a significant problem in
 
04:44:21.770 --> 04:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
the state or
 
04:44:24.050 --> 04:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
uh well let me if if I could I can bring
 
04:44:25.670 --> 04:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
up Mike website I wouldn't want him to
 
04:44:27.708 --> 04:44:27.718 align:start position:0%
lose out since you had Randy Pelletier
 
04:44:32.570 --> 04:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:34.070 --> 04:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
so again Mike's with our Waste
 
04:44:36.530 --> 04:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
Management division good afternoon yes
 
04:44:39.050 --> 04:44:39.060 align:start position:0%
and actually um I think Rainey might be
 
04:44:40.190 --> 04:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
the right person to answer this because
 
04:44:42.230 --> 04:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
much of these funds are going to be used
 
04:44:44.690 --> 04:44:44.700 align:start position:0%
for um looking at water quality and
 
04:44:46.788 --> 04:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
sediments and such that's where we're an
 
04:44:47.990 --> 04:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
area where we can still make some
 
04:44:51.708 --> 04:44:51.718 align:start position:0%
progress in PCB assessment and cleanup
 
04:44:54.410 --> 04:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
um pcbs we to answer the direct question
 
04:44:57.948 --> 04:44:57.958 align:start position:0%
pcbs were used in so many uh products
 
04:44:59.930 --> 04:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
they were in addition to what most
 
04:45:02.410 --> 04:45:02.420 align:start position:0%
people associate them with which is uh
 
04:45:04.788 --> 04:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
dielectric fluids and Transformers and
 
04:45:06.650 --> 04:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
such they also went into paints they
 
04:45:08.750 --> 04:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
went into caulking they went into window
 
04:45:11.810 --> 04:45:11.820 align:start position:0%
glazing and floor tile cement so they
 
04:45:13.970 --> 04:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
occur in many many places but this fund
 
04:45:15.708 --> 04:45:15.718 align:start position:0%
is really not focused on that I believe
 
04:45:18.670 --> 04:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
it's going to be focused on looking at
 
04:45:20.930 --> 04:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
monitoring over time and understanding
 
04:45:22.970 --> 04:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
the impacts of sediment and water
 
04:45:25.550 --> 04:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
quality issues with pcbs on biota and
 
04:45:28.610 --> 04:45:28.620 align:start position:0%
such and rainy is welcome to add more if
 
04:45:30.650 --> 04:45:30.660 align:start position:0%
you need is a question for the director
 
04:45:30.660 --> 04:45:32.570 align:start position:0%
you need is a question for the director
representative

04:45:32.570 --> 04:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:45:34.970 --> 04:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so again two
 
04:45:37.550 --> 04:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
questions that are kind of in one how do
 
04:45:41.810 --> 04:45:41.820 align:start position:0%
1929 to 1977 seems like very specific
 
04:45:43.970 --> 04:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
for in terms of us knowing that it was
 
04:45:45.708 --> 04:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
dumped into the water
 
04:45:48.230 --> 04:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
are we confident there hasn't been any
 
04:45:52.310 --> 04:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
dumping since 77 and what other ways of
 
04:45:55.550 --> 04:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
studying have we done so far on this I
 
04:45:58.250 --> 04:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
believe that manufacturing ceased after
 
04:46:00.230 --> 04:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
that time and so what we're really
 
04:46:04.070 --> 04:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
looking at is essentially Legacy impacts
 
04:46:05.810 --> 04:46:05.820 align:start position:0%
that were even though they stopped
 
04:46:08.570 --> 04:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
manufacturing them they were still
 
04:46:10.970 --> 04:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
well Statewide thousands probably
 
04:46:13.070 --> 04:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
nationally millions of Transformers that
 
04:46:15.650 --> 04:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
contain PCB fluids and that were in
 
04:46:17.810 --> 04:46:17.820 align:start position:0%
service and then when they would fail or
 
04:46:19.550 --> 04:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
blow up in some cases as they do those
 
04:46:21.410 --> 04:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
release so releases certainly occurred
 
04:46:24.170 --> 04:46:24.180 align:start position:0%
after 1977 but I think the manufacturing
 
04:46:28.730 --> 04:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
ceased at that time thank you all set
 
04:46:30.590 --> 04:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
represent Hewitt followed by
 
04:46:32.650 --> 04:46:32.660 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz
 
04:46:36.050 --> 04:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
oh okay I'm sorry representations and
 
04:46:38.390 --> 04:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
isn't this similar to some of the other
 
04:46:42.948 --> 04:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
quality issues of isn't it more that we
 
04:46:46.310 --> 04:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
have a better idea by detection that has
 
04:46:49.070 --> 04:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
improved like isn't this easier to Now
 
04:46:52.368 --> 04:46:52.378 align:start position:0%
find and detect compared to even a
 
04:46:54.830 --> 04:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
decade ago or am I
 
04:46:56.330 --> 04:46:56.340 align:start position:0%
you know because that would make it
 
04:46:58.430 --> 04:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
similar to
 
04:47:00.770 --> 04:47:00.780 align:start position:0%
um why am I blanking on the acronym be
 
04:47:03.170 --> 04:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
fast thank you pfas yeah just say
 
04:47:03.180 --> 04:47:06.410 align:start position:0%
fast thank you pfas yeah just say
feedback

04:47:06.410 --> 04:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:08.690 --> 04:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
very very true you're certainly correct
 
04:47:11.150 --> 04:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
with respect to pfas I think with pcbs
 
04:47:13.190 --> 04:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not specifically familiar with the
 
04:47:14.690 --> 04:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
advancements that have been made since
 
04:47:16.670 --> 04:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
you know in the last 10 years on pcbs
 
04:47:19.070 --> 04:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
but I think we've had a pretty good uh
 
04:47:20.628 --> 04:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
pretty low detection limits and pretty
 
04:47:22.910 --> 04:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
good analytic capabilities for pcbs for
 
04:47:26.330 --> 04:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:29.090 --> 04:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
all right thanks uh yes represent
 
04:47:33.110 --> 04:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
Griffin so as as I'm looking at this and
 
04:47:33.120 --> 04:47:34.368 align:start position:0%
Griffin so as as I'm looking at this and
listening

04:47:34.368 --> 04:47:34.378 align:start position:0%
listening
 
04:47:37.070 --> 04:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh the six million dollars has already
 
04:47:39.230 --> 04:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
been received
 
04:47:41.208 --> 04:47:41.218 align:start position:0%
as part of the settlement
 
04:47:43.368 --> 04:47:43.378 align:start position:0%
so again all the settlement monies went
 
04:47:45.830 --> 04:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
into the general fund we're asking for
 
04:47:47.868 --> 04:47:47.878 align:start position:0%
to take some out of the general fund and
 
04:47:51.350 --> 04:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
section 39 makes us effective
 
04:47:54.830 --> 04:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
June 30 23.
 
04:47:57.470 --> 04:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
so it really doesn't affect
 
04:48:00.670 --> 04:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
the 24-25 budget
 
04:48:04.030 --> 04:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
well it's in the collapse yeah
 
04:48:06.948 --> 04:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead
 
04:48:08.628 --> 04:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
um before we add a big section like this
 
04:48:10.150 --> 04:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
could we
 
04:48:12.288 --> 04:48:12.298 align:start position:0%
informally consult maybe with the
 
04:48:14.090 --> 04:48:14.100 align:start position:0%
resources committee or whoever would
 
04:48:16.310 --> 04:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
normally if this was a bill would
 
04:48:18.708 --> 04:48:18.718 align:start position:0%
normally hear this
 
04:48:21.110 --> 04:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
yeah have you had any discussions with
 
04:48:23.090 --> 04:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
the resources environment and
 
04:48:25.850 --> 04:48:25.860 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and well I think it's it's
 
04:48:29.930 --> 04:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
resources that's water right right yeah
 
04:48:31.550 --> 04:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any discussions with
 
04:48:34.070 --> 04:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
them so you know just just to get an
 
04:48:34.080 --> 04:48:35.288 align:start position:0%
them so you know just just to get an
okay

04:48:35.288 --> 04:48:35.298 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:48:38.990 --> 04:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative evil where are the pcbs
 
04:48:41.930 --> 04:48:41.940 align:start position:0%
found like in groundwater are they
 
04:48:44.930 --> 04:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
coming out landfills or is that part of
 
04:48:46.670 --> 04:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
the idea of this there are a handful of
 
04:48:49.550 --> 04:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
sites really extreme cases where we had
 
04:48:51.288 --> 04:48:51.298 align:start position:0%
releases where we do see PCB
 
04:48:53.208 --> 04:48:53.218 align:start position:0%
concentrations in groundwater but most
 
04:48:55.430 --> 04:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
of the time we don't typically they are
 
04:48:57.830 --> 04:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
bound up and associated with soil and
 
04:49:00.230 --> 04:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
sediments so the big risk that they
 
04:49:02.990 --> 04:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
represent really uh if we if we put it
 
04:49:05.868 --> 04:49:05.878 align:start position:0%
all in context around the state the real
 
04:49:07.670 --> 04:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
area of focus here and the focus of
 
04:49:09.890 --> 04:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
these funds as I understand it is to
 
04:49:11.990 --> 04:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
look at sediment quality in our water
 
04:49:14.030 --> 04:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
bodies because there are a lot of
 
04:49:17.810 --> 04:49:17.820 align:start position:0%
Wildlife and Fish and such that who's uh
 
04:49:19.788 --> 04:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
who are impacted by the content of
 
04:49:21.350 --> 04:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
sediment since and they can be
 
04:49:23.390 --> 04:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
concentrated in fish as a result of the
 
04:49:25.010 --> 04:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:49:26.990 --> 04:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
organisms that they feed on in a water
 
04:49:28.368 --> 04:49:28.378 align:start position:0%
body that are interacting with the
 
04:49:30.050 --> 04:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
sediments so that's really where the
 
04:49:31.670 --> 04:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
focus of this money is is try to
 
04:49:33.470 --> 04:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
understand that understand where we have
 
04:49:35.390 --> 04:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
impaired water bodies that are impaired
 
04:49:37.310 --> 04:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
as a result of that and try to you know
 
04:49:39.590 --> 04:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
take steps to address that
 
04:49:42.050 --> 04:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Michael Mr Hoffman and Melissa
 
04:49:43.430 --> 04:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask representative McGuire
 
04:49:45.288 --> 04:49:45.298 align:start position:0%
to touch base with the chairman of
 
04:49:45.298 --> 04:49:46.670 align:start position:0%
to touch base with the chairman of
resources

04:49:46.670 --> 04:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
resources
 
04:49:51.010 --> 04:49:51.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:54.530 --> 04:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry representative yes thank
 
04:49:56.930 --> 04:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so I would think
 
04:49:58.788 --> 04:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
um when you're talking sediments the
 
04:50:00.948 --> 04:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
Merrimack River would be one of the main
 
04:50:02.628 --> 04:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
things you'd want to study because there
 
04:50:04.490 --> 04:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
were a lot of factories back in the day
 
04:50:06.890 --> 04:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
that probably dumped into there or had
 
04:50:09.890 --> 04:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
releases into there have not studies
 
04:50:13.190 --> 04:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
been done already since 1977 like when
 
04:50:16.550 --> 04:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
the Clean Water acts went into effect so
 
04:50:19.250 --> 04:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
why are we doing more studies now if if
 
04:50:21.890 --> 04:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
in fact I'm assuming a ton of studies
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
must have been done in the previous
 
04:50:26.270 --> 04:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
years I'll preface my remarks by saying
 
04:50:28.850 --> 04:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
I am not at the esa expert on that body
 
04:50:31.250 --> 04:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
of data but my understanding is that um
 
04:50:34.010 --> 04:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
we have uh relatively little data we
 
04:50:36.050 --> 04:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
probably know in certain reaches of
 
04:50:37.730 --> 04:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
certain Rivers where we've done a lot of
 
04:50:39.650 --> 04:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
studies we probably know quite a bit but
 
04:50:41.390 --> 04:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
we have thousands of water bodies in the
 
04:50:43.788 --> 04:50:43.798 align:start position:0%
state where we may not have any PCB data
 
04:50:45.830 --> 04:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
at all for a given water body so I think
 
04:50:47.510 --> 04:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
the idea of this is over time and this
 
04:50:48.770 --> 04:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
will be implemented over a number of
 
04:50:51.770 --> 04:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
years to try to incorporate PCB analysis
 
04:50:53.570 --> 04:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
and we may be going out to those water
 
04:50:55.430 --> 04:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
bodies and taking samples and looking at
 
04:50:57.590 --> 04:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
a number of water sediment parameters
 
04:50:59.690 --> 04:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
but pcbs isn't one of them and the
 
04:51:01.910 --> 04:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
analyzes are expensive so this would
 
04:51:05.150 --> 04:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
provide funding to try to add pcbs as a
 
04:51:07.550 --> 04:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
to the list of compounds that are that
 
04:51:09.230 --> 04:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
are tested for when we do those sediment
 
04:51:09.240 --> 04:51:12.410 align:start position:0%
are tested for when we do those sediment
studies

04:51:12.410 --> 04:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:14.330 --> 04:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
you raise a good question represent
 
04:51:16.490 --> 04:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
cambrell's because a whosatonic river
 
04:51:19.610 --> 04:51:19.620 align:start position:0%
was known for its PCP loading and
 
04:51:21.830 --> 04:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
there's been some different views
 
04:51:23.448 --> 04:51:23.458 align:start position:0%
whether it should be just left alone
 
04:51:25.788 --> 04:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
because once you start digging it brings
 
04:51:28.368 --> 04:51:28.378 align:start position:0%
it to the surface and there's signs all
 
04:51:30.110 --> 04:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
down through the adanta eat the fish
 
04:51:32.690 --> 04:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
because it's so saturated but again
 
04:51:35.570 --> 04:51:35.580 align:start position:0%
there's a number of different uh views
 
04:51:37.670 --> 04:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
on what to do with pcbs but represent
 
04:51:39.948 --> 04:51:39.958 align:start position:0%
evil I think has a question
 
04:51:42.170 --> 04:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
I was just we were talking about the
 
04:51:44.330 --> 04:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
bill I don't remember what number it was
 
04:51:46.730 --> 04:51:46.740 align:start position:0%
uh earlier before you guys came where
 
04:51:48.530 --> 04:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
you had requested the two or the bill
 
04:51:51.410 --> 04:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
requested two million dollars for study
 
04:51:55.010 --> 04:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
in addition House Bill 212 for the study
 
04:51:58.010 --> 04:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
of pfas remember you had 6 million and
 
04:51:59.510 --> 04:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
then you were trying to replace that and
 
04:52:01.310 --> 04:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
you didn't feel like you could use the
 
04:52:04.190 --> 04:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
pfas fund for anything but loans if
 
04:52:07.850 --> 04:52:07.860 align:start position:0%
we're really trying to cut or try to do
 
04:52:09.890 --> 04:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
better with some of the money that we
 
04:52:12.170 --> 04:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
have could some of this money be used
 
04:52:14.628 --> 04:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
for the pfas study too is it a similar
 
04:52:17.990 --> 04:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
kind of a study this piece this PCB
 
04:52:20.390 --> 04:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like well the the I
 
04:52:22.788 --> 04:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
guess if if the full settlement for 25
 
04:52:24.890 --> 04:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
million went into the general funds it
 
04:52:27.288 --> 04:52:27.298 align:start position:0%
must not have had guard rails on it for
 
04:52:30.890 --> 04:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
use for pcbs so you're trying to reclaim
 
04:52:36.470 --> 04:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:39.530 --> 04:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
I think that's all correct
 
04:52:39.540 --> 04:52:40.208 align:start position:0%
I think that's all correct
yeah

04:52:40.208 --> 04:52:40.218 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:52:43.610 --> 04:52:43.620 align:start position:0%
well it's just a it's just a thought
 
04:52:45.830 --> 04:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
I mean if it was the choice between not
 
04:52:48.830 --> 04:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
having the pfest money or or just sort
 
04:52:50.930 --> 04:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
of setting up kind of a study fund for
 
04:52:54.288 --> 04:52:54.298 align:start position:0%
pcbs in pfas she's asking about a
 
04:52:58.490 --> 04:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
hospital 212. yes understood
 
04:53:00.288 --> 04:53:00.298 align:start position:0%
know you don't want to give up
 
04:53:02.990 --> 04:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
use between your children exactly it was
 
04:53:07.550 --> 04:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:10.610 --> 04:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll get an answer we'll
 
04:53:12.288 --> 04:53:12.298 align:start position:0%
get an answer from representative
 
04:53:14.150 --> 04:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
McGuire once he talks to the folks at
 
04:53:17.390 --> 04:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
resources on 38 which will also affect
 
04:53:17.400 --> 04:53:20.570 align:start position:0%
resources on 38 which will also affect
39.

04:53:20.570 --> 04:53:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:23.330 --> 04:53:23.340 align:start position:0%
all right so we have
 
04:53:27.948 --> 04:53:27.958 align:start position:0%
section 47 removes nhdes name from
 
04:53:27.958 --> 04:53:29.690 align:start position:0%
section 47 removes nhdes name from
statute

04:53:29.690 --> 04:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:53:32.510 --> 04:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
okay so so again this is just clean up
 
04:53:36.590 --> 04:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh the department of energy this was
 
04:53:36.600 --> 04:53:38.090 align:start position:0%
uh the department of energy this was
was

04:53:38.090 --> 04:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:53:39.830 --> 04:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
really in the department of energies
 
04:53:41.390 --> 04:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
bailiwick so it's something that we
 
04:53:43.430 --> 04:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
don't really have a say over or or feel
 
04:53:45.350 --> 04:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
we should uh and we're just asking for
 
04:53:47.990 --> 04:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
our name to be taken out I do believe
 
04:53:50.750 --> 04:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
this uh there's also a bill and I
 
04:53:53.030 --> 04:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
apologize I think this is duplicate so I
 
04:53:54.530 --> 04:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
think it's in the House Bill 2 here and
 
04:53:55.850 --> 04:53:55.860 align:start position:0%
I think there's a separate Standalone
 
04:53:58.970 --> 04:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
Bill if I remember right
 
04:54:05.868 --> 04:54:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:07.610 --> 04:54:07.620 align:start position:0%
all right that sounds pretty simple
 
04:54:10.128 --> 04:54:10.138 align:start position:0%
we're okay with that in House Bill 211 I
 
04:54:12.170 --> 04:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
will say the the prime sponsor is the
 
04:54:13.910 --> 04:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
first is the same person who put the
 
04:54:20.390 --> 04:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:25.070 --> 04:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:25.080 --> 04:54:26.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:54:26.390 --> 04:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:54:27.830 --> 04:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
I kind of went here already but I
 
04:54:29.930 --> 04:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh in the discussion about the
 
04:54:31.868 --> 04:54:31.878 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and our councils
 
04:54:35.390 --> 04:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh that we we are asking for technical
 
04:54:38.448 --> 04:54:38.458 align:start position:0%
amendments uh so that we can move our
 
04:54:43.490 --> 04:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
the position uh listed here uh 19491 the
 
04:54:45.368 --> 04:54:45.378 align:start position:0%
legal aid position from our department
 
04:54:47.628 --> 04:54:47.638 align:start position:0%
and move it over to Department of
 
04:54:49.368 --> 04:54:49.378 align:start position:0%
Justice so they can support the councils
 
04:54:52.070 --> 04:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
from there instead so uh to the extent
 
04:54:55.670 --> 04:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
that that those elements are
 
04:54:57.770 --> 04:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
put forth and passed in hospital two
 
04:54:59.510 --> 04:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
we'd want this to happen also and I
 
04:55:01.430 --> 04:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
think attorney general formula may have
 
04:55:03.470 --> 04:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned this yesterday also
 
04:55:06.170 --> 04:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
so Michael and Melissa's Amendment for
 
04:55:10.490 --> 04:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:10.500 --> 04:55:13.430 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:55:13.430 --> 04:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:15.650 --> 04:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
and we're I'm clocking in a time too so
 
04:55:17.208 --> 04:55:17.218 align:start position:0%
I don't know how much you want to go the
 
04:55:19.510 --> 04:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
next slides talk about the new positions
 
04:55:22.010 --> 04:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
uh obviously we can go one by one if you
 
04:55:24.890 --> 04:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
like but I I uh we do have some uh
 
04:55:26.810 --> 04:55:26.820 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs I very much want to
 
04:55:29.448 --> 04:55:29.458 align:start position:0%
talk about but I will say for the the
 
04:55:32.750 --> 04:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
positions that you see by and large they
 
04:55:34.190 --> 04:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
you'll note they have to do with
 
04:55:37.310 --> 04:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
accounting or information technology
 
04:55:40.730 --> 04:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
systems and much of that has to do with
 
04:55:43.010 --> 04:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
we mentioned the large amount of new
 
04:55:44.150 --> 04:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
money we're getting through the federal
 
04:55:46.788 --> 04:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
government over the next five years uh
 
04:55:48.530 --> 04:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
to the extent we have to service those
 
04:55:51.410 --> 04:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
loans meet all the requirements from the
 
04:55:53.930 --> 04:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
federal government and and meet all the
 
04:55:55.610 --> 04:55:55.620 align:start position:0%
auditing requirements that's kind of the
 
04:55:57.288 --> 04:55:57.298 align:start position:0%
gift that keeps on giving those loans
 
04:56:00.050 --> 04:56:00.060 align:start position:0%
and we need staff to support those uh
 
04:56:02.628 --> 04:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
similarly we need to you know we are in
 
04:56:04.810 --> 04:56:04.820 align:start position:0%
the middle of trying to upgrade our our
 
04:56:07.430 --> 04:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
electronic systems uh and there's 10
 
04:56:08.990 --> 04:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
rules on both sides of that so that's
 
04:56:10.490 --> 04:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
the majority of those we do have some
 
04:56:11.930 --> 04:56:11.940 align:start position:0%
other positions and again I don't know
 
04:56:13.670 --> 04:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
how you want to how do you want to
 
04:56:16.128 --> 04:56:16.138 align:start position:0%
attack those
 
04:56:19.850 --> 04:56:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:22.128 --> 04:56:22.138 align:start position:0%
so these are all within your budget
 
04:56:24.708 --> 04:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
these are not an additional ask as you
 
04:56:30.288 --> 04:56:30.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:32.628 --> 04:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
questions representative Sweeney thank
 
04:56:34.430 --> 04:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so just for these
 
04:56:37.250 --> 04:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
positions on page 13 how many are
 
04:56:39.110 --> 04:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
General funds and how many are funded by
 
04:56:40.788 --> 04:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
the grants and the loans that they're
 
04:56:40.798 --> 04:56:42.590 align:start position:0%
the grants and the loans that they're
yeah

04:56:42.590 --> 04:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:56:46.970 --> 04:56:46.980 align:start position:0%
um there are five general fund positions
 
04:56:49.250 --> 04:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
um and then the rest are funded a
 
04:56:55.250 --> 04:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:59.208 --> 04:56:59.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:01.070 --> 04:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
because I knew you were going to ask the
 
04:57:01.080 --> 04:57:07.788 align:start position:0%
because I knew you were going to ask the
question

04:57:07.788 --> 04:57:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:11.150 --> 04:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
um of those of the other remaining
 
04:57:13.610 --> 04:57:13.620 align:start position:0%
there's one two three four five federal
 
04:57:16.250 --> 04:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
funds and one two three four that are
 
04:57:18.110 --> 04:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
funded with fees
 
04:57:20.030 --> 04:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:57:22.310 --> 04:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire is a question yes
 
04:57:26.270 --> 04:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
so you have 478 current employees or
 
04:57:29.810 --> 04:57:29.820 align:start position:0%
positions how many are vacant
 
04:57:32.990 --> 04:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
right now we have 71 positions that are
 
04:57:43.368 --> 04:57:43.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:45.530 --> 04:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
and the question you're not asking is we
 
04:57:51.948 --> 04:57:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:54.708 --> 04:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
so whether we add the what is this 15 or
 
04:57:57.830 --> 04:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
no 14 14.
 
04:57:59.890 --> 04:57:59.900 align:start position:0%
won't make that much difference
 
04:58:03.830 --> 04:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:06.708 --> 04:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
any further questions on
 
04:58:10.310 --> 04:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
slide 13.
 
04:58:13.670 --> 04:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:15.770 --> 04:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
I know there's some questions on the
 
04:58:18.830 --> 04:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
next slide I believe
 
04:58:21.288 --> 04:58:21.298 align:start position:0%
so if I could it probably I'll just
 
04:58:23.270 --> 04:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
outline and then the next slide actually
 
04:58:24.890 --> 04:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
goes into detail on our additional
 
04:58:26.628 --> 04:58:26.638 align:start position:0%
funding requests from our prioritized
 
04:58:29.868 --> 04:58:29.878 align:start position:0%
needs so uh you'll see the figures in
 
04:58:31.250 --> 04:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
the first one are for the Winnipesaukee
 
04:58:34.788 --> 04:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
River Basin uh and I'll talk to that to
 
04:58:37.730 --> 04:58:37.740 align:start position:0%
the next slide as detail uh the the and
 
04:58:39.410 --> 04:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
you'll see the figures for the the next
 
04:58:44.030 --> 04:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
line down is for two uh one for one of a
 
04:58:46.128 --> 04:58:46.138 align:start position:0%
better word orphan landfills that need
 
04:58:47.690 --> 04:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
some servicing so they don't cause an
 
04:58:50.628 --> 04:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
environmental problem and then uh we
 
04:58:54.050 --> 04:58:54.060 align:start position:0%
also have have a we'd like to to move a
 
04:58:56.628 --> 04:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
position to to full time which I'll talk
 
04:58:59.110 --> 04:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
about in a moment also so we had other
 
04:59:01.490 --> 04:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
uh prioritized needs but these are the
 
04:59:05.390 --> 04:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
ones that we really mean if you will
 
04:59:07.550 --> 04:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
so the the first one going to the next
 
04:59:10.610 --> 04:59:10.620 align:start position:0%
slide 15 is uh the Winnipesaukee River
 
04:59:12.470 --> 04:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
Basin project as we mentioned we've
 
04:59:13.788 --> 04:59:13.798 align:start position:0%
talked to that already a little bit and
 
04:59:16.730 --> 04:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
again this is uh as we discussed this is
 
04:59:16.740 --> 04:59:17.990 align:start position:0%
again this is uh as we discussed this is
uh

04:59:17.990 --> 04:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:59:20.030 --> 04:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
find it out of those communities so
 
04:59:22.730 --> 04:59:22.740 align:start position:0%
we've had as you may imagine moving
 
04:59:25.670 --> 04:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
water and waste is very energy intensive
 
04:59:29.050 --> 04:59:29.060 align:start position:0%
uh requires a lot of chemicals
 
04:59:32.330 --> 04:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
and certainly periodic and ongoing
 
04:59:36.650 --> 04:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
upkeep so uh a lot of this increase that
 
04:59:39.490 --> 04:59:39.500 align:start position:0%
we're asking for is for utility costs
 
04:59:42.050 --> 04:59:42.060 align:start position:0%
unless you I'm not not that you would
 
04:59:43.310 --> 04:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
but unless you're living under a rock
 
04:59:45.170 --> 04:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
everybody's paying for a lot you know
 
04:59:47.270 --> 04:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
their heat and electricity is a lot more
 
04:59:51.368 --> 04:59:51.378 align:start position:0%
now uh the plant has the same same
 
04:59:53.690 --> 04:59:53.700 align:start position:0%
impacts uh and they're again a high
 
04:59:57.050 --> 04:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
energy user uh the supply chain issues
 
04:59:59.330 --> 04:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
especially given kovid uh you know it's
 
05:00:00.650 --> 05:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
hard to predict when things will get
 
05:00:04.010 --> 05:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
better but we the chemicals needed at
 
05:00:05.868 --> 05:00:05.878 align:start position:0%
the plant are have gone up exponentially
 
05:00:09.890 --> 05:00:09.900 align:start position:0%
as well uh during covert covid uh
 
05:00:12.050 --> 05:00:12.060 align:start position:0%
between just being able to get some of
 
05:00:15.770 --> 05:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
this work done uh contract work uh and
 
05:00:18.530 --> 05:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
to get materials again the supply chain
 
05:00:21.470 --> 05:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
issues we were forced to defer some
 
05:00:24.708 --> 05:00:24.718 align:start position:0%
maintenance during during covid uh we
 
05:00:28.150 --> 05:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to defer longer the the a
 
05:00:31.010 --> 05:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
putting off today to tomorrow is not a
 
05:00:32.930 --> 05:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
good strategy to save money uh
 
05:00:35.390 --> 05:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in a lot of these cases so
 
05:00:37.490 --> 05:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
this really is is our biggest
 
05:00:39.288 --> 05:00:39.298 align:start position:0%
prioritized need that you know we have
 
05:00:40.910 --> 05:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
an obligation to run these plans for the
 
05:00:43.070 --> 05:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
community as the communities as a state
 
05:00:46.730 --> 05:00:46.740 align:start position:0%
and this unfortunately this increase is
 
05:00:49.910 --> 05:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
needed in order to make that happen so
 
05:00:54.350 --> 05:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
um that's our biggest biggest ask uh in
 
05:00:56.628 --> 05:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
our prioritized needs I can stop there
 
05:00:59.270 --> 05:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
and keep going I don't representative so
 
05:01:00.350 --> 05:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
it says
 
05:01:02.628 --> 05:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
funding mix it says a hundred percent
 
05:01:02.638 --> 05:01:03.650 align:start position:0%
funding mix it says a hundred percent
other

05:01:03.650 --> 05:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:01:05.690 --> 05:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
correct what's the other so again this
 
05:01:07.610 --> 05:01:07.620 align:start position:0%
everything that happens at that plan is
 
05:01:09.230 --> 05:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
funded through those communities and
 
05:01:11.448 --> 05:01:11.458 align:start position:0%
their rates they're expecting this uh
 
05:01:12.890 --> 05:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
again so this has all been vetted
 
05:01:15.948 --> 05:01:15.958 align:start position:0%
through that their boards uh and is
 
05:01:18.110 --> 05:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
they're already a lot of the communities
 
05:01:19.550 --> 05:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
have their own collection systems and
 
05:01:21.770 --> 05:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
then feed to our collection system so
 
05:01:24.350 --> 05:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
they they've actually started uh
 
05:01:25.850 --> 05:01:25.860 align:start position:0%
assuming this is going to happen and
 
05:01:28.010 --> 05:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
started embedding this because again I
 
05:01:29.810 --> 05:01:29.820 align:start position:0%
think nobody wants to pay higher rates
 
05:01:31.430 --> 05:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
but they understand that if you don't
 
05:01:33.170 --> 05:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
fix something now it it doesn't get
 
05:01:35.390 --> 05:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
cheaper later
 
05:01:38.150 --> 05:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire What's the total
 
05:01:41.208 --> 05:01:41.218 align:start position:0%
budget in this group so what kind of
 
05:01:45.410 --> 05:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
percent increases is this 1.3
 
05:01:47.690 --> 05:01:47.700 align:start position:0%
um for women this
 
05:01:50.570 --> 05:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
um would be a 25 increase in the rate in
 
05:01:53.090 --> 05:01:53.100 align:start position:0%
the cost of our budget if you have the
 
05:01:55.970 --> 05:01:55.980 align:start position:0%
budget open it's page 694.
 
05:01:59.208 --> 05:01:59.218 align:start position:0%
so the users will find see a 25 higher
 
05:01:59.218 --> 05:02:02.030 align:start position:0%
so the users will find see a 25 higher
bill

05:02:02.030 --> 05:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:04.670 --> 05:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:07.910 --> 05:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:10.010 --> 05:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
um so we're not sure what their rate
 
05:02:12.288 --> 05:02:12.298 align:start position:0%
increases will be because they have in
 
05:02:14.150 --> 05:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
addition to feeding into the system they
 
05:02:16.610 --> 05:02:16.620 align:start position:0%
have pieces that are their own as I
 
05:02:18.708 --> 05:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned those those entities also have
 
05:02:20.208 --> 05:02:20.218 align:start position:0%
their own collection systems and their
 
05:02:23.510 --> 05:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
own staff and that all feeds us so it's
 
05:02:24.948 --> 05:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
hard to answer that so certainly yes
 
05:02:27.310 --> 05:02:27.320 align:start position:0%
that's a an increase in that a 25
 
05:02:30.530 --> 05:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
increase in that portion of their budget
 
05:02:32.330 --> 05:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
and again we don't do that lightly but
 
05:02:34.368 --> 05:02:34.378 align:start position:0%
we don't really see a lot of choice okay
 
05:02:36.530 --> 05:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Sweeney has a
 
05:02:38.390 --> 05:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr merch on that same
 
05:02:40.670 --> 05:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
topic so would the towns that have
 
05:02:42.890 --> 05:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
budget meeting have to vote
 
05:02:44.930 --> 05:02:44.940 align:start position:0%
to increase their rates and pay for part
 
05:02:47.510 --> 05:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
of this or would that just be dealt with
 
05:02:51.230 --> 05:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
their select boards setting the rates
 
05:02:53.270 --> 05:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
I believe I don't know let me ask Mr
 
05:02:55.730 --> 05:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
Pelletier if I could so it may depend on
 
05:03:03.530 --> 05:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:05.868 --> 05:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
I think most of these whenever they have
 
05:03:08.810 --> 05:03:08.820 align:start position:0%
rates depending on their local structure
 
05:03:11.030 --> 05:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
they go to town meeting and it'll have a
 
05:03:13.250 --> 05:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
discussion and I would like to note that
 
05:03:16.610 --> 05:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
of this 25 increase that Susan was
 
05:03:18.708 --> 05:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
talking about the average household
 
05:03:21.170 --> 05:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
increase caused by the Basin just the
 
05:03:23.930 --> 05:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
Basin not their infrastructure costs is
 
05:03:27.410 --> 05:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
probably around two dollars
 
05:03:28.850 --> 05:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
per user
 
05:03:28.860 --> 05:03:30.170 align:start position:0%
per user
so

05:03:30.170 --> 05:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:03:33.910 --> 05:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
is like Bob explained almost like
 
05:03:37.610 --> 05:03:37.620 align:start position:0%
Laconia is 50 of our flow but we have 60
 
05:03:40.550 --> 05:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
miles of pipeline to get to Franklin all
 
05:03:42.590 --> 05:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
of the other infrastructure is owned by
 
05:03:45.770 --> 05:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
the 10 municipalities so a lot of their
 
05:03:45.780 --> 05:03:46.910 align:start position:0%
the 10 municipalities so a lot of their
piping

05:03:46.910 --> 05:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
piping
 
05:03:50.270 --> 05:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
they're responsible for yet we have 60
 
05:03:53.150 --> 05:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
miles of collection pipe that they all
 
05:03:57.110 --> 05:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:58.550 --> 05:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
05:04:01.910 --> 05:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
this number is more like one dollar per
 
05:04:04.128 --> 05:04:04.138 align:start position:0%
everyone in New Hampshire right there's
 
05:04:07.070 --> 05:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
a 1.4 million people in New Hampshire so
 
05:04:09.830 --> 05:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
if the Lakes Region or the people in
 
05:04:12.770 --> 05:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
those 10 communities that are using this
 
05:04:16.368 --> 05:04:16.378 align:start position:0%
right they've got to be 10 or less of
 
05:04:18.708 --> 05:04:18.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so it's really got to be
 
05:04:20.810 --> 05:04:20.820 align:start position:0%
at least ten dollars a person kind of
 
05:04:24.170 --> 05:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:27.590 --> 05:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
just our cost when you look at what we
 
05:04:29.510 --> 05:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
charge the increase over what they've
 
05:04:31.788 --> 05:04:31.798 align:start position:0%
been paying us is not anywhere near ten
 
05:04:31.798 --> 05:04:35.990 align:start position:0%
been paying us is not anywhere near ten
dollars

05:04:35.990 --> 05:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:39.670 --> 05:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
oh monthly yes okay
 
05:04:44.270 --> 05:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
well yeah it's okay thank you
 
05:04:50.990 --> 05:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:53.810 --> 05:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
further questions on this side well I
 
05:04:55.670 --> 05:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
would just say I'm I'm all right with
 
05:04:57.470 --> 05:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
this I think that they need it in order
 
05:04:59.330 --> 05:04:59.340 align:start position:0%
to operate their wastewater treatment
 
05:05:02.810 --> 05:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
and it's really up to the communities to
 
05:05:04.250 --> 05:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
deal with it
 
05:05:07.610 --> 05:05:07.620 align:start position:0%
right the division's pleasure everybody
 
05:05:10.010 --> 05:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
okay with that
 
05:05:15.110 --> 05:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
an ad Mr Hoffman and Melissa please
 
05:05:19.788 --> 05:05:19.798 align:start position:0%
okay item a on page 15 right
 
05:05:23.990 --> 05:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:26.390 --> 05:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
and on page 14 they'll have the numbers
 
05:05:32.150 --> 05:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:36.230 --> 05:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
all right Solid Waste program contracts
 
05:05:39.350 --> 05:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
so again we have two online landfills as
 
05:05:41.150 --> 05:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
I mentioned I call them orphans that
 
05:05:43.510 --> 05:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
there there is no responsible party for
 
05:05:47.090 --> 05:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
and this line item again it's roughly
 
05:05:48.890 --> 05:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
sixty thousand dollars a year but it is
 
05:05:52.310 --> 05:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
from the general fund uh they ask uh is
 
05:05:55.010 --> 05:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
to to basically to to get conduct
 
05:05:57.288 --> 05:05:57.298 align:start position:0%
maintenance and modern monitoring to
 
05:06:00.350 --> 05:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
keep those uh in line so we have some
 
05:06:02.030 --> 05:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
some idea what's going on with those and
 
05:06:04.368 --> 05:06:04.378 align:start position:0%
keep those from becoming a problem so I
 
05:06:06.830 --> 05:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
I don't like the idea as staff will know
 
05:06:09.050 --> 05:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
of Orphan landfills but we feel a
 
05:06:10.670 --> 05:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility to make sure those two
 
05:06:11.990 --> 05:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
communities are not impacted
 
05:06:14.448 --> 05:06:14.458 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin has a question I
 
05:06:16.550 --> 05:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
I guess I'd like to know how we end up
 
05:06:18.250 --> 05:06:18.260 align:start position:0%
with them often
 
05:06:21.310 --> 05:06:21.320 align:start position:0%
landfilled with no responsible party
 
05:06:23.208 --> 05:06:23.218 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
05:06:26.750 --> 05:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:28.670 --> 05:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that it is a good question and
 
05:06:30.650 --> 05:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
these two particular landfills one of
 
05:06:33.530 --> 05:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
them um was abandoned the owner died and
 
05:06:36.948 --> 05:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
through the uh the dissolution of the
 
05:06:38.690 --> 05:06:38.700 align:start position:0%
estate this essentially became an
 
05:06:40.850 --> 05:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
abandoned piece of property
 
05:06:42.830 --> 05:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
um it needs to have some groundwater
 
05:06:45.050 --> 05:06:45.060 align:start position:0%
monitoring done and some basic cap
 
05:06:47.868 --> 05:06:47.878 align:start position:0%
maintenance we are working to try to
 
05:06:49.610 --> 05:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
find a solution and an owner for the
 
05:06:51.410 --> 05:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
site and a use for the site where a
 
05:06:52.730 --> 05:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
private owner would take care of the
 
05:06:55.430 --> 05:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities but in the meantime we
 
05:06:57.650 --> 05:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that we understand the
 
05:06:59.330 --> 05:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
conditions at the landfill to ensure
 
05:07:01.610 --> 05:07:01.620 align:start position:0%
that it's not posing a risk to any
 
05:07:04.070 --> 05:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
nearby residents or what have you and
 
05:07:06.110 --> 05:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
then the other one is a landfill that
 
05:07:06.120 --> 05:07:06.890 align:start position:0%
then the other one is a landfill that
was

05:07:06.890 --> 05:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:07:09.170 --> 05:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
it's a very complicated story it's the
 
05:07:10.970 --> 05:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
dummy yard landfill in Berlin and
 
05:07:13.070 --> 05:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
success It's associated with the former
 
05:07:15.288 --> 05:07:15.298 align:start position:0%
paper mills it went through a bankruptcy
 
05:07:17.270 --> 05:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
there was a trust established that
 
05:07:19.550 --> 05:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
provided a modest amount of money for
 
05:07:21.170 --> 05:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
its care and feeding if you will it's
 
05:07:22.730 --> 05:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
you know I mean it's the cap and
 
05:07:26.150 --> 05:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
monitoring but that money has since
 
05:07:28.310 --> 05:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
um has since been expended and there's
 
05:07:30.170 --> 05:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
no more money and no responsible party
 
05:07:32.030 --> 05:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
that we can look to there were some
 
05:07:33.830 --> 05:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
agreements the state made going way back
 
05:07:33.840 --> 05:07:34.970 align:start position:0%
agreements the state made going way back
that

05:07:34.970 --> 05:07:34.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:07:38.090 --> 05:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
could read that we we we're not sure we
 
05:07:39.590 --> 05:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
can say we just don't want to do this
 
05:07:42.590 --> 05:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
plus we obviously once again we want to
 
05:07:44.930 --> 05:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
make sure that the facility isn't posing
 
05:07:46.670 --> 05:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
any risk to the nearby properties and
 
05:07:46.680 --> 05:07:48.350 align:start position:0%
any risk to the nearby properties and
Residences

05:07:48.350 --> 05:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
Residences
 
05:07:48.360 --> 05:07:51.110 align:start position:0%
Residences
representative

05:07:51.110 --> 05:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:07:53.270 --> 05:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
if this isn't appropriated what happens
 
05:07:56.208 --> 05:07:56.218 align:start position:0%
we just aren't monitored right it'd be
 
05:07:58.250 --> 05:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to I don't know I'm not
 
05:08:01.490 --> 05:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
sure how we'd get that work done
 
05:08:03.590 --> 05:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you so just
 
05:08:05.448 --> 05:08:05.458 align:start position:0%
want Clarity so it says maintenance and
 
05:08:07.490 --> 05:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
monitoring I'm not a I can't imagine
 
05:08:09.788 --> 05:08:09.798 align:start position:0%
we're taking two landfills
 
05:08:11.990 --> 05:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
rehabilitating the land for future use
 
05:08:14.810 --> 05:08:14.820 align:start position:0%
like they're going to stay as unused no
 
05:08:17.030 --> 05:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
sir this is very modest work this is
 
05:08:18.650 --> 05:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
just making sure when the landfill is
 
05:08:21.110 --> 05:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
closed typically it gets capped at the
 
05:08:23.090 --> 05:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
very least if not with the synthetic
 
05:08:26.330 --> 05:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
cover with a appropriate soil cover and
 
05:08:28.730 --> 05:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
you know wood Chucks and things to play
 
05:08:29.990 --> 05:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
around with that and so there's a
 
05:08:31.670 --> 05:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
certain amount and you have to mow it um
 
05:08:33.830 --> 05:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
you should vegetate the cap so there's a
 
05:08:35.270 --> 05:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
certain amount of Maintenance of a soil
 
05:08:37.670 --> 05:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
cap that's needed in order to ensure
 
05:08:39.650 --> 05:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
that it continues to do what what the
 
05:08:41.270 --> 05:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
cap is intended to do is essentially to
 
05:08:42.890 --> 05:08:42.900 align:start position:0%
limit the amount of rain water
 
05:08:44.510 --> 05:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
infiltration of the landfill so you
 
05:08:46.490 --> 05:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of
 
05:08:48.650 --> 05:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
um uh leachate that's collected in the
 
05:08:50.990 --> 05:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
potential impact slave that the landfill
 
05:08:52.750 --> 05:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
can have on groundwater
 
05:08:55.250 --> 05:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz so you mentioned
 
05:08:57.350 --> 05:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
Berlin is where one of those are do you
 
05:09:00.110 --> 05:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
mind naming where the other one is oh
 
05:09:05.270 --> 05:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:09.470 --> 05:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
all right the division's pleasure on uh
 
05:09:13.670 --> 05:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste program contracts
 
05:09:14.948 --> 05:09:14.958 align:start position:0%
so yeah
 
05:09:17.570 --> 05:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
everybody okay with that
 
05:09:18.788 --> 05:09:18.798 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:09:24.250 --> 05:09:24.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:26.470 --> 05:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
so C
 
05:09:29.330 --> 05:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
Administration and support the main
 
05:09:30.410 --> 05:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
issue is
 
05:09:33.590 --> 05:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
if you set a precedent that that you can
 
05:09:35.448 --> 05:09:35.458 align:start position:0%
walk away from your landfill and the
 
05:09:37.490 --> 05:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
state will take care of it right you
 
05:09:40.250 --> 05:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
know but that's the main problem I think
 
05:09:42.830 --> 05:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
the department and justice department
 
05:09:44.628 --> 05:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
has been pretty aggressive in the past
 
05:09:46.910 --> 05:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
right and holding people responsible
 
05:09:48.050 --> 05:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
where there's someone to hold
 
05:09:50.510 --> 05:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
responsible is that correct and not to
 
05:09:52.490 --> 05:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
be trite but the one in Danbury the
 
05:09:54.890 --> 05:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
owner died and you know I'm not sure
 
05:09:57.610 --> 05:09:57.620 align:start position:0%
there's a harsher penalty than that
 
05:10:03.288 --> 05:10:03.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:05.628 --> 05:10:05.638 align:start position:0%
problem is since these are unlined
 
05:10:07.850 --> 05:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
landfills if there is a lot of pollution
 
05:10:09.948 --> 05:10:09.958 align:start position:0%
coming out of them then who deals with
 
05:10:12.110 --> 05:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
that so it's
 
05:10:14.628 --> 05:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
anyway too bad they're orphans all right
 
05:10:16.850 --> 05:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
moving right along commissioner so the
 
05:10:19.430 --> 05:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
last ask we have is again this is a mix
 
05:10:23.090 --> 05:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
of funding but it is 53 Journal funds uh
 
05:10:25.910 --> 05:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
is for uh there are many of our front
 
05:10:28.190 --> 05:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
desk we are we are looking to upgrade a
 
05:10:31.730 --> 05:10:31.740 align:start position:0%
position to full-time uh and what we've
 
05:10:33.470 --> 05:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
seen is there's that expectation in the
 
05:10:35.690 --> 05:10:35.700 align:start position:0%
public we try to do a lot online clearly
 
05:10:39.288 --> 05:10:39.298 align:start position:0%
and and whatnot but we for obvious
 
05:10:40.970 --> 05:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
reasons I hope you all agree we have a
 
05:10:43.010 --> 05:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
front desk there at Hazen drive and when
 
05:10:44.690 --> 05:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in we want a live body to
 
05:10:46.788 --> 05:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
answer their questions and help them and
 
05:10:48.470 --> 05:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
that's been a little bit problematic so
 
05:10:52.788 --> 05:10:52.798 align:start position:0%
we're looking to to do this uh with this
 
05:10:52.798 --> 05:10:54.650 align:start position:0%
we're looking to to do this uh with this
increase

05:10:54.650 --> 05:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
increase
 
05:10:57.110 --> 05:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
we okay with this
 
05:10:57.120 --> 05:10:59.390 align:start position:0%
we okay with this
everybody

05:10:59.390 --> 05:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
05:11:02.628 --> 05:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:04.610 --> 05:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
small ones all add up representative
 
05:11:04.620 --> 05:11:05.830 align:start position:0%
small ones all add up representative
McGuire

05:11:05.830 --> 05:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
McGuire
 
05:11:15.170 --> 05:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:15.180 --> 05:11:19.490 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:11:19.490 --> 05:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:22.670 --> 05:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
so moving to budget adjustments so again
 
05:11:25.490 --> 05:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
these are all uh
 
05:11:28.368 --> 05:11:28.378 align:start position:0%
no cost yeah we'll quickly ask some
 
05:11:29.750 --> 05:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
Carlson to do that
 
05:11:32.448 --> 05:11:32.458 align:start position:0%
uh yes essentially
 
05:11:34.010 --> 05:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
um the first
 
05:11:36.230 --> 05:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
um the first two items
 
05:11:39.170 --> 05:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
um we are moving um the P2 which is
 
05:11:41.270 --> 05:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
pollution prevention and the Small
 
05:11:43.070 --> 05:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
Business technical assistant programs
 
05:11:46.910 --> 05:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
those two programs were until
 
05:11:48.830 --> 05:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
um right now housed in the
 
05:11:50.270 --> 05:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
Commissioner's Office what we're doing
 
05:11:53.030 --> 05:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
is sending those two programs part of it
 
05:11:54.890 --> 05:11:54.900 align:start position:0%
back to the air division part of it back
 
05:11:57.350 --> 05:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
to the waste division so we're just
 
05:12:00.050 --> 05:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
taking the accounting units and moving
 
05:12:02.330 --> 05:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
them out of one the commissioner's
 
05:12:04.368 --> 05:12:04.378 align:start position:0%
office and sending some of it back to
 
05:12:06.650 --> 05:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
the air and some of it back to to waste
 
05:12:08.930 --> 05:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
and it is detailed on the technical
 
05:12:11.090 --> 05:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
adjustment sheet here
 
05:12:13.310 --> 05:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
um so that you can see the pluses and
 
05:12:15.410 --> 05:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
minus it's a zero-sum game to our budget
 
05:12:20.090 --> 05:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
it just is moving them between divisions
 
05:12:22.070 --> 05:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
um the coastal resiliency infrastructure
 
05:12:25.730 --> 05:12:25.740 align:start position:0%
program we are simply moving money
 
05:12:28.730 --> 05:12:28.740 align:start position:0%
between classes when we set up the
 
05:12:31.190 --> 05:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
budget back in August
 
05:12:34.550 --> 05:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
um we anticipated 2.8 million dollars
 
05:12:37.970 --> 05:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
um in class 85 for interagency Grant
 
05:12:37.980 --> 05:12:39.530 align:start position:0%
um in class 85 for interagency Grant
transfers

05:12:39.530 --> 05:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
transfers
 
05:12:41.750 --> 05:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
um with prices as they are we understand
 
05:12:44.150 --> 05:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a price increase so
 
05:12:46.368 --> 05:12:46.378 align:start position:0%
we're decreasing the contract line by
 
05:12:49.910 --> 05:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
125 000 in 24 and increasing the
 
05:12:53.448 --> 05:12:53.458 align:start position:0%
interagency transfer line by 125 so it's
 
05:12:56.110 --> 05:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
again another zero-sum game
 
05:13:00.230 --> 05:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
the state air permit program which is
 
05:13:02.990 --> 05:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
the last of our ass
 
05:13:03.000 --> 05:13:03.890 align:start position:0%
the last of our ass
um

05:13:03.890 --> 05:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:06.708 --> 05:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
this is a correction and I must
 
05:13:08.810 --> 05:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
apologize to the committee I should have
 
05:13:11.750 --> 05:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
had it fixed in the governor's phase and
 
05:13:13.868 --> 05:13:13.878 align:start position:0%
I just didn't get to it
 
05:13:17.090 --> 05:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
what is happening is
 
05:13:17.100 --> 05:13:18.410 align:start position:0%
what is happening is
um

05:13:18.410 --> 05:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:22.610 --> 05:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
this is an idiosyncrasy of the um the
 
05:13:25.128 --> 05:13:25.138 align:start position:0%
bars system
 
05:13:27.948 --> 05:13:27.958 align:start position:0%
which is the state's budgeting system we
 
05:13:31.368 --> 05:13:31.378 align:start position:0%
had put on a prioritized need to this
 
05:13:34.010 --> 05:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
account to partially fund this account
 
05:13:38.030 --> 05:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
by 250 000 of General funds we attempted
 
05:13:40.070 --> 05:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
to make this prioritized need a revenue
 
05:13:41.690 --> 05:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
adjustment only
 
05:13:44.510 --> 05:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
bars cannot handle a revenue adjustment
 
05:13:47.810 --> 05:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
only so administrative services in order
 
05:13:50.628 --> 05:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
to get this into the budget created a
 
05:13:53.030 --> 05:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
class 103 contracts for operational
 
05:13:56.570 --> 05:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
Services of 250 000 we're asking for
 
05:13:56.580 --> 05:13:57.470 align:start position:0%
Services of 250 000 we're asking for
that

05:13:57.470 --> 05:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:14:01.010 --> 05:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
expenditure class to be eliminated and
 
05:14:03.590 --> 05:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
to reduce the agency income by the same
 
05:14:06.550 --> 05:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:09.170 --> 05:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
any questions on that representative
 
05:14:10.850 --> 05:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
McGuire so this is really just
 
05:14:17.810 --> 05:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:20.090 --> 05:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
so don't run away yet we do have further
 
05:14:20.100 --> 05:14:23.030 align:start position:0%
so don't run away yet we do have further
questions

05:14:23.030 --> 05:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:25.128 --> 05:14:25.138 align:start position:0%
so I see it was the chairman of Public
 
05:14:27.948 --> 05:14:27.958 align:start position:0%
Works still back there
 
05:14:30.650 --> 05:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
nice to see you sir if you'd like to sit
 
05:14:41.810 --> 05:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:45.830 --> 05:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
so a house bill 276.
 
05:14:48.070 --> 05:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
um the bacteria mitigation
 
05:14:50.448 --> 05:14:50.458 align:start position:0%
what can you tell us about that
 
05:14:52.190 --> 05:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
representative Ebel had asked if we
 
05:14:54.288 --> 05:14:54.298 align:start position:0%
could send that to you for your advice
 
05:14:56.930 --> 05:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
and wisdom
 
05:15:00.708 --> 05:15:00.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman the
 
05:15:04.490 --> 05:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
we were surprised to see that uh House
 
05:15:07.190 --> 05:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
Bill 276 did not come through Public
 
05:15:08.990 --> 05:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
Works which is where we thought it
 
05:15:11.270 --> 05:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
should have come through and then to
 
05:15:15.410 --> 05:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
find out it's a 25 million dollar uh
 
05:15:17.090 --> 05:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
Capital uh
 
05:15:20.448 --> 05:15:20.458 align:start position:0%
uh mitigation fund that they want to set
 
05:15:24.948 --> 05:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
up and we're a bit perplexed that where
 
05:15:28.368 --> 05:15:28.378 align:start position:0%
our entire budget is only in the 120
 
05:15:30.650 --> 05:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
million dollar range how we could ever
 
05:15:32.628 --> 05:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
afford that
 
05:15:36.230 --> 05:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
and so I was uh I I see absolutely
 
05:15:39.410 --> 05:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
nowhere that we can find 25 million
 
05:15:42.128 --> 05:15:42.138 align:start position:0%
dollars out of that budget I guess
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
you're no stranger to this but there
 
05:15:46.850 --> 05:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
were over a billion dollars worth of
 
05:15:49.788 --> 05:15:49.798 align:start position:0%
requests and you know we're down to 120
 
05:15:53.390 --> 05:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
million so I I don't see that we have
 
05:15:56.448 --> 05:15:56.458 align:start position:0%
room for it I understand that I don't
 
05:15:58.610 --> 05:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
know what action you've taken on it and
 
05:16:00.650 --> 05:16:00.660 align:start position:0%
if I should have further conversation
 
05:16:03.770 --> 05:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
with you Mr chairman on that or no we
 
05:16:05.810 --> 05:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
trust your guidance that we're hearing
 
05:16:07.788 --> 05:16:07.798 align:start position:0%
right now sir okay
 
05:16:09.590 --> 05:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's why we thought it should head
 
05:16:11.150 --> 05:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
over to you it seemed like a more
 
05:16:13.670 --> 05:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate place for it we try to send
 
05:16:15.830 --> 05:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
anything that with a major policy or
 
05:16:17.570 --> 05:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
something that should be in another
 
05:16:19.970 --> 05:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
committee there first to get a read
 
05:16:21.110 --> 05:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
because we're supposed to be just
 
05:16:23.030 --> 05:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the numbers okay we try to
 
05:16:24.708 --> 05:16:24.718 align:start position:0%
hold by that we appreciate that and we
 
05:16:26.690 --> 05:16:26.700 align:start position:0%
appreciate the courtesy of referring it
 
05:16:28.910 --> 05:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
over to us well not at all however that
 
05:16:30.410 --> 05:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
process will happen we won't get out of
 
05:16:31.730 --> 05:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
here without a question from
 
05:16:34.250 --> 05:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire well no I'm going
 
05:16:35.690 --> 05:16:35.700 align:start position:0%
to say let me give you a statement so
 
05:16:38.690 --> 05:16:38.700 align:start position:0%
earlier today we decided to retain this
 
05:16:42.230 --> 05:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
bill because of the problematic funding
 
05:16:44.570 --> 05:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
and then look at it this one we're
 
05:16:45.948 --> 05:16:45.958 align:start position:0%
really going to look at it over the
 
05:16:48.770 --> 05:16:48.780 align:start position:0%
summer and figure out where we can find
 
05:16:51.050 --> 05:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
money for it how much is needed all that
 
05:16:53.448 --> 05:16:53.458 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff because effectively this
 
05:16:56.510 --> 05:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
bill is borrowing money and giving it
 
05:16:58.550 --> 05:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
away in Grants right and that doesn't
 
05:17:01.190 --> 05:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
really make sense so you know that
 
05:17:03.230 --> 05:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
that's the idea representative McGuire I
 
05:17:05.090 --> 05:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
agree with your approach okay thank you
 
05:17:07.550 --> 05:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
very good thank you thank you so much
 
05:17:07.560 --> 05:17:12.948 align:start position:0%
very good thank you thank you so much
thanks

05:17:12.948 --> 05:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:15.230 --> 05:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
so on another note
 
05:17:17.990 --> 05:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
um I know Mr Wimsatt will appreciate
 
05:17:19.750 --> 05:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
this perhaps
 
05:17:23.390 --> 05:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh the division did support unanimously
 
05:17:25.970 --> 05:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
the uh two million dollars for the solid
 
05:17:27.948 --> 05:17:27.958 align:start position:0%
waste management fund to be put in the
 
05:17:27.958 --> 05:17:30.650 align:start position:0%
waste management fund to be put in the
budget

05:17:30.650 --> 05:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:33.470 --> 05:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
thank all you for helping representative
 
05:17:37.070 --> 05:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:38.750 --> 05:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
um anything else that the division has
 
05:17:41.270 --> 05:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney sorry I not a
 
05:17:44.510 --> 05:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
problem uh 212 on the pfas
 
05:17:49.850 --> 05:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
fund yeah if if if we can get uh either
 
05:17:53.390 --> 05:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
a one-pager or a spreadsheet of where
 
05:17:55.128 --> 05:17:55.138 align:start position:0%
the current fund is what is going to
 
05:17:57.890 --> 05:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
lapse over the next year there was
 
05:17:59.570 --> 05:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
mention of six million dollars lapsing
 
05:18:01.368 --> 05:18:01.378 align:start position:0%
this year
 
05:18:03.770 --> 05:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
um and just what the trajectory and
 
05:18:08.448 --> 05:18:08.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:13.030 --> 05:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:15.590 --> 05:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
so too yes this is the one you were
 
05:18:17.690 --> 05:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
doing yeah yeah it was coming back in
 
05:18:20.810 --> 05:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
brief if I may in brief answer to your
 
05:18:22.910 --> 05:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
question yes that was requested at your
 
05:18:24.708 --> 05:18:24.718 align:start position:0%
session on Friday and we'll have that
 
05:18:26.090 --> 05:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
letter for you probably tomorrow it'll
 
05:18:35.288 --> 05:18:35.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:38.030 --> 05:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
I know we spoke about representative
 
05:18:40.550 --> 05:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
Evil's two million dollars I thought no
 
05:18:42.890 --> 05:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
but it was HP 300 the one on the food
 
05:18:45.170 --> 05:18:45.180 align:start position:0%
waste we voted to include oh okay okay
 
05:18:45.180 --> 05:18:46.690 align:start position:0%
waste we voted to include oh okay okay
okay

05:18:46.690 --> 05:18:46.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:18:51.470 --> 05:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
not to jump ahead that was like 78 000.
 
05:18:53.208 --> 05:18:53.218 align:start position:0%
and I was very happy
 
05:18:56.690 --> 05:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
I can't I can't take it back I'm afraid
 
05:18:59.270 --> 05:18:59.280 align:start position:0%

for your presentation and if you could
 
05:19:07.270 --> 05:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
get that information to the LBA was just
 
05:19:09.670 --> 05:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney's question
 
05:19:11.930 --> 05:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
answered that'd be great
 
05:19:14.390 --> 05:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your time I don't see
 
05:19:16.788 --> 05:19:16.798 align:start position:0%
a need to have you come back so
 
05:19:18.948 --> 05:19:18.958 align:start position:0%
I will let you know obviously if you do
 
05:24:52.850 --> 05:24:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:55.368 --> 05:24:55.378 align:start position:0%
so we'll open up the budget Works
 
05:24:57.350 --> 05:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
session on the Department of Business
 
05:25:00.230 --> 05:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
and economic Affairs and I see the
 
05:25:02.150 --> 05:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner here
 
05:25:05.830 --> 05:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
we have a package and we'll let you
 
05:25:08.570 --> 05:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
take it away and just looking to see
 
05:25:13.390 --> 05:25:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:17.930 --> 05:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:22.310 --> 05:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
you're on page 545 for those
 
05:25:44.150 --> 05:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:44.160 --> 05:25:54.350 align:start position:0%
 
545

05:25:54.350 --> 05:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:56.690 --> 05:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
all right commissioner it's all yours to
 
05:25:58.430 --> 05:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
well uh Mr chairman thank you for having
 
05:26:00.410 --> 05:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
us I I don't have a whole ton of
 
05:26:02.510 --> 05:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
prepared remarks just because we have
 
05:26:04.850 --> 05:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
had a conversation just about two weeks
 
05:26:06.650 --> 05:26:06.660 align:start position:0%
ago about the department itself and what
 
05:26:08.150 --> 05:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
we do
 
05:26:09.890 --> 05:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
um you know I think from the standpoint
 
05:26:12.350 --> 05:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
just a brief overview uh the Department
 
05:26:14.270 --> 05:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
of Business and economic Affairs has
 
05:26:16.190 --> 05:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
within it two main divisions the
 
05:26:18.110 --> 05:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
division of travel tourism development
 
05:26:20.150 --> 05:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
and the division of Economic Development
 
05:26:23.050 --> 05:26:23.060 align:start position:0%
we have also within us a number of other
 
05:26:25.610 --> 05:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
organizations and offices including the
 
05:26:27.890 --> 05:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
office of outdoor recreation industry
 
05:26:29.930 --> 05:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
development the office of Workforce
 
05:26:32.090 --> 05:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
opportunity the office of international
 
05:26:35.208 --> 05:26:35.218 align:start position:0%
Commerce so we do a lot of work in the
 
05:26:38.150 --> 05:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
International Space in creating markets
 
05:26:40.190 --> 05:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire businesses and working
 
05:26:42.288 --> 05:26:42.298 align:start position:0%
with those businesses to access those
 
05:26:45.410 --> 05:26:45.420 align:start position:0%
markets and we have uh you know maybe
 
05:26:47.208 --> 05:26:47.218 align:start position:0%
another couple of other offices
 
05:26:49.330 --> 05:26:49.340 align:start position:0%
including our administrative office
 
05:26:52.128 --> 05:26:52.138 align:start position:0%
so when we look at the budget that we
 
05:26:54.890 --> 05:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
have here today we don't have a real a
 
05:26:56.628 --> 05:26:56.638 align:start position:0%
very significant increase of requests
 
05:26:59.690 --> 05:26:59.700 align:start position:0%
over our previous biennium we don't have
 
05:27:03.350 --> 05:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
any sort of like major changes within
 
05:27:06.050 --> 05:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
that budget from the last biennium I
 
05:27:09.470 --> 05:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
think as far as positions go we current
 
05:27:11.948 --> 05:27:11.958 align:start position:0%
we currently have around 76
 
05:27:16.010 --> 05:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
positions listed uh in our budget
 
05:27:19.610 --> 05:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
um and we have a a requesting for two
 
05:27:21.410 --> 05:27:21.420 align:start position:0%
funding two additional positions one
 
05:27:25.250 --> 05:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
both within our administrative office
 
05:27:28.250 --> 05:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
um I would say really those are kind of
 
05:27:30.530 --> 05:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
the highlights but I'm certainly here to
 
05:27:32.628 --> 05:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
be able to discuss or to go into detail
 
05:27:34.430 --> 05:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
on any subjects related to the
 
05:27:36.590 --> 05:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
Department of our or our budget that you
 
05:27:39.170 --> 05:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
uh that you want to bring up today
 
05:27:41.270 --> 05:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
well they're always budget questions do
 
05:27:44.390 --> 05:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
you have a budget in front of you or I
 
05:27:45.850 --> 05:27:45.860 align:start position:0%
do okay
 
05:27:48.708 --> 05:27:48.718 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire has a question
 
05:27:51.170 --> 05:27:51.180 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:27:54.770 --> 05:27:54.780 align:start position:0%
for coming so uh let's go to page 561
 
05:27:57.410 --> 05:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
the kind of the end of the budget
 
05:28:01.430 --> 05:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
um and uh these are the grand totals and
 
05:28:03.708 --> 05:28:03.718 align:start position:0%
it looks like the most variability is in
 
05:28:06.530 --> 05:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
your federal funds so you actually
 
05:28:11.030 --> 05:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
receive 6.7 in 2022
 
05:28:15.288 --> 05:28:15.298 align:start position:0%
um 2023 was was expected to be 10 I
 
05:28:18.350 --> 05:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
don't know if it is or not and then and
 
05:28:19.610 --> 05:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
then for the next two years you're
 
05:28:23.410 --> 05:28:23.420 align:start position:0%
expecting big increases right 11.3
 
05:28:26.390 --> 05:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
14.8 so what's going on with several
 
05:28:28.910 --> 05:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
certainly so we have within uh ba a
 
05:28:29.930 --> 05:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
number of offices that are almost
 
05:28:32.750 --> 05:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
exclusively federally funded uh and each
 
05:28:34.368 --> 05:28:34.378 align:start position:0%
of those are seeing increases on the
 
05:28:36.110 --> 05:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
federal side so the office of Workforce
 
05:28:39.110 --> 05:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity administers the Department
 
05:28:41.570 --> 05:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
of Labor's Workforce Innovation and
 
05:28:44.510 --> 05:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
Opportunity Act funds we owe a funds uh
 
05:28:47.330 --> 05:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
the uh procurement technical assistance
 
05:28:50.270 --> 05:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
center PTAC works with businesses that
 
05:28:51.410 --> 05:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
are looking to access government
 
05:28:53.448 --> 05:28:53.458 align:start position:0%
contracts that's funded by the
 
05:28:55.850 --> 05:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense we have the office
 
05:28:58.128 --> 05:28:58.138 align:start position:0%
of international Commerce which is
 
05:29:00.230 --> 05:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
largely funded by the small business
 
05:29:02.690 --> 05:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
administration through a step Grant so
 
05:29:05.170 --> 05:29:05.180 align:start position:0%
each of those three right there
 
05:29:07.850 --> 05:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
saw increases over the last several
 
05:29:09.288 --> 05:29:09.298 align:start position:0%
years since covid and I think that's
 
05:29:11.990 --> 05:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
what you're seeing reflected here
 
05:29:15.110 --> 05:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
further yes but I noticed the total
 
05:29:18.470 --> 05:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
number of employees is unchanging so are
 
05:29:20.570 --> 05:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
most of these extra federal funds going
 
05:29:22.850 --> 05:29:22.860 align:start position:0%
out back out as grants yes sir they're
 
05:29:25.850 --> 05:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
programmatic funds gotcha okay now you
 
05:29:28.490 --> 05:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
said you wanted two more employees is
 
05:29:28.500 --> 05:29:30.368 align:start position:0%
said you wanted two more employees is
that

05:29:30.368 --> 05:29:30.378 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:29:33.650 --> 05:29:33.660 align:start position:0%
unfunded employees from previously or is
 
05:29:37.368 --> 05:29:37.378 align:start position:0%
it so uh yes these are positions that
 
05:29:39.410 --> 05:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
were not previously funded in the last
 
05:29:42.650 --> 05:29:42.660 align:start position:0%
biennium one of them is human resources
 
05:29:45.170 --> 05:29:45.180 align:start position:0%
position uh which we it was a position
 
05:29:48.230 --> 05:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
that we lost just before covid came in
 
05:29:50.690 --> 05:29:50.700 align:start position:0%
and at that time as you'll recall we
 
05:29:52.490 --> 05:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
went into a budgetary lockdown
 
05:29:55.430 --> 05:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
effectively and so we did not fill that
 
05:29:57.288 --> 05:29:57.298 align:start position:0%
position and we made went through the
 
05:29:59.150 --> 05:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
last biennium without having funding
 
05:30:02.270 --> 05:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
Associated for that while we have 76
 
05:30:04.190 --> 05:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
employees a good portion of those
 
05:30:06.770 --> 05:30:06.780 align:start position:0%
employees are on our rest area and
 
05:30:09.530 --> 05:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
welcome center side and that does demand
 
05:30:12.890 --> 05:30:12.900 align:start position:0%
a lot of a lot of effort to continue to
 
05:30:14.868 --> 05:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
do all the Recruitment and all the
 
05:30:16.310 --> 05:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
things that we've spoken about before
 
05:30:19.610 --> 05:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
for that for that part of our office we
 
05:30:24.470 --> 05:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
do also have uh some a new office the
 
05:30:26.570 --> 05:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
office of planning and development that
 
05:30:28.310 --> 05:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
came over as part of the Department of
 
05:30:31.990 --> 05:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
energy uh split that came last biennium
 
05:30:35.208 --> 05:30:35.218 align:start position:0%
that added about six employees I believe
 
05:30:37.730 --> 05:30:37.740 align:start position:0%
to us so since the time that we lost
 
05:30:39.470 --> 05:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
that HR position we have seen some
 
05:30:41.448 --> 05:30:41.458 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of positions and
 
05:30:42.890 --> 05:30:42.900 align:start position:0%
I think the HR needs are really pretty
 
05:30:45.050 --> 05:30:45.060 align:start position:0%
substantial so we asked for that okay
 
05:30:47.990 --> 05:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
and how many of the 76 positions are
 
05:30:48.000 --> 05:30:51.170 align:start position:0%
and how many of the 76 positions are
vacant

05:30:51.170 --> 05:30:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:55.368 --> 05:30:55.378 align:start position:0%
not too many right now uh the we have as
 
05:30:57.410 --> 05:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
far as our Concord staff and the
 
05:30:59.030 --> 05:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
immediate policy staff I don't believe
 
05:31:02.030 --> 05:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
we have any openings all of our uh
 
05:31:03.770 --> 05:31:03.780 align:start position:0%
openings are on the rest area Welcome
 
05:31:07.730 --> 05:31:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:11.930 --> 05:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:15.350 --> 05:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:18.170 --> 05:31:18.180 align:start position:0%
no there's never a dumb question maybe
 
05:31:19.730 --> 05:31:19.740 align:start position:0%
this one is
 
05:31:19.740 --> 05:31:20.570 align:start position:0%
this one is
um

05:31:20.570 --> 05:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:23.810 --> 05:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
I know that there has been there have in
 
05:31:25.670 --> 05:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
recent years been a number of programs
 
05:31:28.128 --> 05:31:28.138 align:start position:0%
to give certain industries in New
 
05:31:28.138 --> 05:31:29.690 align:start position:0%
to give certain industries in New
Hampshire

05:31:29.690 --> 05:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:31:33.050 --> 05:31:33.060 align:start position:0%
um an incentive for workers by forgiving
 
05:31:35.448 --> 05:31:35.458 align:start position:0%
their student loans to some degree
 
05:31:38.810 --> 05:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
does that money come from your
 
05:31:41.510 --> 05:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
Department okay no ma'am that's uh so
 
05:31:43.670 --> 05:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's a proposal I believe that's in
 
05:31:45.770 --> 05:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
hb2 for this year and it would run
 
05:31:47.330 --> 05:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
through the business Finance Authority
 
05:31:49.610 --> 05:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
who we work with but it's a separate uh
 
05:31:55.010 --> 05:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:58.368 --> 05:31:58.378 align:start position:0%
there is a biotech one already don't
 
05:31:59.868 --> 05:31:59.878 align:start position:0%
close the door because it doesn't work
 
05:32:02.390 --> 05:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's gonna get it locked in oh
 
05:32:04.610 --> 05:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
interesting nobody wants it it would be
 
05:32:07.730 --> 05:32:07.740 align:start position:0%
your fault yeah
 
05:32:10.788 --> 05:32:10.798 align:start position:0%
you will not make friends
 
05:32:12.708 --> 05:32:12.718 align:start position:0%
it was I was under the impression that
 
05:32:15.708 --> 05:32:15.718 align:start position:0%
there were already ongoing programs uh
 
05:32:19.250 --> 05:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
that for example were targeted for Dean
 
05:32:20.990 --> 05:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
cayman's companies but I believe they
 
05:32:23.330 --> 05:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
were expanded to biotech so so I don't
 
05:32:24.948 --> 05:32:24.958 align:start position:0%
know what your involvement in those type
 
05:32:27.110 --> 05:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
of obviously maybe the budget is
 
05:32:29.810 --> 05:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
different but you must at some degree be
 
05:32:31.490 --> 05:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
involved with those type of programs
 
05:32:33.470 --> 05:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
development you are correct so there is
 
05:32:36.050 --> 05:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
a program that is specific for uh
 
05:32:38.170 --> 05:32:38.180 align:start position:0%
companies that locate in New Hampshire
 
05:32:40.610 --> 05:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
uh that are qualified under the
 
05:32:44.090 --> 05:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
regenerative manufacturing uh thing so
 
05:32:46.850 --> 05:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
uh companies that come to New Hampshire
 
05:32:49.190 --> 05:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
and there have been a couple are
 
05:32:51.230 --> 05:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
eligible to work with the business
 
05:32:55.490 --> 05:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority uh for that benefit
 
05:32:57.948 --> 05:32:57.958 align:start position:0%
and I think what you're seeing in hb2 is
 
05:32:59.750 --> 05:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
a potential expansion
 
05:33:02.750 --> 05:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
of that program to a broader number of
 
05:33:02.760 --> 05:33:05.810 align:start position:0%
of that program to a broader number of
Industries

05:33:05.810 --> 05:33:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:09.590 --> 05:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:11.810 --> 05:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
05:33:14.330 --> 05:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:33:17.750 --> 05:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
is it Liz Gray she's here on behalf of
 
05:33:20.448 --> 05:33:20.458 align:start position:0%
the sbdc and there is a letter here that
 
05:33:22.190 --> 05:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
you were hoping to increase the
 
05:33:24.110 --> 05:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation from the governor's
 
05:33:26.510 --> 05:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
recommended budget I didn't know
 
05:33:28.910 --> 05:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
who should talk about that
 
05:33:30.890 --> 05:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
well I could say uh you know we work
 
05:33:32.390 --> 05:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
very closely with the Small Business
 
05:33:34.850 --> 05:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
Development Center uh and with Liz and
 
05:33:37.990 --> 05:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
her team our retention team
 
05:33:41.628 --> 05:33:41.638 align:start position:0%
that is out in the field every day is
 
05:33:44.868 --> 05:33:44.878 align:start position:0%
constantly working with sbdc we had
 
05:33:48.430 --> 05:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
requested I think 500 000 per
 
05:33:52.190 --> 05:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
biennium uh to to provide help provide
 
05:33:54.590 --> 05:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
funding to sbdc that's a necessary part
 
05:33:58.250 --> 05:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
of their uh of their funding scheme with
 
05:33:59.690 --> 05:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
the number that we have in the budget
 
05:34:02.990 --> 05:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
right now is I believe at 390 yes
 
05:34:05.448 --> 05:34:05.458 align:start position:0%
so could you describe a little bit more
 
05:34:08.390 --> 05:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
what their function is so small Business
 
05:34:10.070 --> 05:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
Development Center list is probably a
 
05:34:11.570 --> 05:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
better job than I do in describing this
 
05:34:13.670 --> 05:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
but they work with very very small
 
05:34:16.368 --> 05:34:16.378 align:start position:0%
businesses uh in a whole host of
 
05:34:18.410 --> 05:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
different Industries to help those
 
05:34:18.420 --> 05:34:19.670 align:start position:0%
different Industries to help those
companies

05:34:19.670 --> 05:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
companies
 
05:34:22.850 --> 05:34:22.860 align:start position:0%
um get to a point where they uh uh can
 
05:34:24.530 --> 05:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
either start a business or continue to
 
05:34:26.448 --> 05:34:26.458 align:start position:0%
operate a business
 
05:34:29.510 --> 05:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
um and give them assistance that is you
 
05:34:31.970 --> 05:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
know of no cost to the to the uh to the
 
05:34:31.980 --> 05:34:32.810 align:start position:0%
know of no cost to the to the uh to the
company

05:34:32.810 --> 05:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
company
 
05:34:36.230 --> 05:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
so where we are seeing a lot of those
 
05:34:38.208 --> 05:34:38.218 align:start position:0%
businesses in our day-to-day business
 
05:34:40.910 --> 05:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
operations we would generally refer them
 
05:34:43.550 --> 05:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
to sbdc for additional assistance
 
05:34:45.770 --> 05:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
so it's there's a very there's a very
 
05:34:48.470 --> 05:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
close relationship between us
 
05:34:48.480 --> 05:34:50.750 align:start position:0%
close relationship between us
really

05:34:50.750 --> 05:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:34:53.448 --> 05:34:53.458 align:start position:0%
say would you like us to consider this
 
05:34:55.490 --> 05:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
additional request it was a request that
 
05:35:00.708 --> 05:35:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:04.670 --> 05:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
so I have a question going back to uh
 
05:35:06.890 --> 05:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
earlier what representative McGuire was
 
05:35:08.570 --> 05:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
asking about some of the
 
05:35:12.708 --> 05:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
funding I see obviously that your
 
05:35:15.170 --> 05:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
general fund line has gone up for the
 
05:35:16.788 --> 05:35:16.798 align:start position:0%
next biennium
 
05:35:20.690 --> 05:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
pretty substantially 2.2 million and two
 
05:35:24.288 --> 05:35:24.298 align:start position:0%
point a little more than 2.3 million
 
05:35:26.930 --> 05:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
in for 25 could you tell us where some
 
05:35:28.868 --> 05:35:28.878 align:start position:0%
of those
 
05:35:32.330 --> 05:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
significant general fund or is it
 
05:35:34.610 --> 05:35:34.620 align:start position:0%
um smaller amounts that just add up to a
 
05:35:36.410 --> 05:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
significant amount I think it's a little
 
05:35:38.628 --> 05:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
bit the former but I would also say to
 
05:35:41.690 --> 05:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
remember that the funding that we put
 
05:35:44.150 --> 05:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
forward for the state's tourism
 
05:35:47.448 --> 05:35:47.458 align:start position:0%
marketing is reflective of the revenue
 
05:35:49.250 --> 05:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
the revenue that comes in under the
 
05:35:52.250 --> 05:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax so under our
 
05:35:54.948 --> 05:35:54.958 align:start position:0%
statute we submit a budget that
 
05:35:58.190 --> 05:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
represents 3.15 percent of those
 
05:35:58.200 --> 05:35:59.410 align:start position:0%
represents 3.15 percent of those
revenues

05:35:59.410 --> 05:35:59.420 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
05:36:02.390 --> 05:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
and as a result I would say of the fine
 
05:36:04.610 --> 05:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
work of Lori harnoy's and the team at
 
05:36:05.990 --> 05:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
travel and tourism we have seen
 
05:36:08.930 --> 05:36:08.940 align:start position:0%
increases in those Revenue numbers over
 
05:36:12.050 --> 05:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
the last two years and so naturally the
 
05:36:15.530 --> 05:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
number that we request and that comes
 
05:36:15.540 --> 05:36:16.628 align:start position:0%
number that we request and that comes
through

05:36:16.628 --> 05:36:16.638 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:36:19.850 --> 05:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
that we spend on the funding for that
 
05:36:22.670 --> 05:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
marketing uh naturally sees an increase
 
05:36:25.970 --> 05:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
in those years I would add to that that
 
05:36:29.330 --> 05:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
this year the data that we have
 
05:36:32.208 --> 05:36:32.218 align:start position:0%
indicates that for every dollar that we
 
05:36:34.490 --> 05:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
invest in marketing the state of New
 
05:36:38.170 --> 05:36:38.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the uh meals and rentals tax
 
05:36:41.690 --> 05:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
increases by about 16 so we it's it's
 
05:36:43.550 --> 05:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
one dollar for every 16 that we see in
 
05:36:43.560 --> 05:36:47.868 align:start position:0%
one dollar for every 16 that we see in
return

05:36:47.868 --> 05:36:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:50.150 --> 05:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
where are the questions representative
 
05:36:50.160 --> 05:36:55.670 align:start position:0%
where are the questions representative
McGuire

05:36:55.670 --> 05:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:58.610 --> 05:36:58.620 align:start position:0%
represents Sweden thank you Mr chairman
 
05:37:01.128 --> 05:37:01.138 align:start position:0%
in the past when there has ever been an
 
05:37:04.610 --> 05:37:04.620 align:start position:0%
economic softening do we see how long is
 
05:37:04.620 --> 05:37:05.750 align:start position:0%
economic softening do we see how long is
the

05:37:05.750 --> 05:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:37:07.850 --> 05:37:07.860 align:start position:0%
delay in seeing that impact on either
 
05:37:11.448 --> 05:37:11.458 align:start position:0%
tourism or the amusement rooms Revenue
 
05:37:14.090 --> 05:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
um that's one of the first places we
 
05:37:16.310 --> 05:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
start to see the impact of an economic
 
05:37:18.530 --> 05:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
downturn and people stop you know
 
05:37:21.350 --> 05:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
spending money to to travel or to go out
 
05:37:23.510 --> 05:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
to dinner so it is one of the first
 
05:37:26.868 --> 05:37:26.878 align:start position:0%
places we would see an indicator of
 
05:37:28.490 --> 05:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
things going down but you're I think
 
05:37:30.190 --> 05:37:30.200 align:start position:0%
where you're going is that yes when we
 
05:37:32.810 --> 05:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
are in a position where we see a
 
05:37:35.990 --> 05:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
downturn in the level of tourism in the
 
05:37:38.030 --> 05:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
state the marketing funds that we have
 
05:37:39.708 --> 05:37:39.718 align:start position:0%
available to us actually also go down
 
05:37:42.230 --> 05:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
one one could argue that's backwards but
 
05:37:44.448 --> 05:37:44.458 align:start position:0%
I yeah that's the system that we have
 
05:37:45.770 --> 05:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
and that's the way it works and so we
 
05:37:47.750 --> 05:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
deal with that when that comes up thank
 
05:37:53.030 --> 05:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:56.150 --> 05:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking commissioner at the Small
 
05:37:58.250 --> 05:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
Business Development Center
 
05:38:04.128 --> 05:38:04.138 align:start position:0%
funding which I believe is on page 555
 
05:38:06.288 --> 05:38:06.298 align:start position:0%
and the governor's recommended amount is
 
05:38:06.298 --> 05:38:08.030 align:start position:0%
and the governor's recommended amount is
390

05:38:08.030 --> 05:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
390
 
05:38:08.868 --> 05:38:08.878 align:start position:0%
000 and
 
05:38:11.270 --> 05:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
so this request that we just received
 
05:38:14.208 --> 05:38:14.218 align:start position:0%
would be for again the additional five
 
05:38:16.910 --> 05:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand
 
05:38:18.708 --> 05:38:18.718 align:start position:0%
it would be an additional 110. okay
 
05:38:22.250 --> 05:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:25.788 --> 05:38:25.798 align:start position:0%
so they're 500 000 is here
 
05:38:28.190 --> 05:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
total watch not an additional watch
 
05:38:28.200 --> 05:38:36.650 align:start position:0%
total watch not an additional watch
correct

05:38:36.650 --> 05:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:39.050 --> 05:38:39.060 align:start position:0%
return on investment they it looks
 
05:38:55.128 --> 05:38:55.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:59.750 --> 05:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:02.448 --> 05:39:02.458 align:start position:0%
we do have a number of House Bill 2
 
05:39:04.730 --> 05:39:04.740 align:start position:0%
items I think I saw
 
05:39:06.430 --> 05:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
your department
 
05:39:10.430 --> 05:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
listed next to and while we're going
 
05:39:10.440 --> 05:39:11.510 align:start position:0%
listed next to and while we're going
there

05:39:11.510 --> 05:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:39:13.730 --> 05:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
you have a role in invest New Hampshire
 
05:39:15.708 --> 05:39:15.718 align:start position:0%
is that right yes sir
 
05:39:17.990 --> 05:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
so tell us what that's about because
 
05:39:20.090 --> 05:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
there's a pretty significant want for
 
05:39:25.850 --> 05:39:25.860 align:start position:0%
that yes so if SNH is a program that ba
 
05:39:28.390 --> 05:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
has been operating since the summer of
 
05:39:31.730 --> 05:39:31.740 align:start position:0%
2022. this is a total of 100 million
 
05:39:35.510 --> 05:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
dollars that was allocated to Bea for
 
05:39:37.010 --> 05:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
the purposes of addressing affordable
 
05:39:40.628 --> 05:39:40.638 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing in the state we have
 
05:39:43.788 --> 05:39:43.798 align:start position:0%
divided that fund into a number of
 
05:39:47.030 --> 05:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
different programs the first program is
 
05:39:50.208 --> 05:39:50.218 align:start position:0%
the capital grant program and that was a
 
05:39:53.208 --> 05:39:53.218 align:start position:0%
a program that has been underway since
 
05:39:55.190 --> 05:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
awards were approved by the executive
 
05:39:57.610 --> 05:39:57.620 align:start position:0%
Council in early November of
 
05:40:01.128 --> 05:40:01.138 align:start position:0%
2022. those are funds that are designed
 
05:40:05.570 --> 05:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
for affordable housing that that is a
 
05:40:07.850 --> 05:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
rental in nature new build already
 
05:40:10.190 --> 05:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
underway these funds were designed to
 
05:40:13.570 --> 05:40:13.580 align:start position:0%
help supplement the resources to those
 
05:40:16.368 --> 05:40:16.378 align:start position:0%
programs to those projects to be able to
 
05:40:20.270 --> 05:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
get those units online more quickly we
 
05:40:22.430 --> 05:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
are currently operating that program and
 
05:40:25.430 --> 05:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
funds are being dispersed under that
 
05:40:28.970 --> 05:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
program the other program has to do with
 
05:40:33.128 --> 05:40:33.138 align:start position:0%
support for municipalities as part of
 
05:40:36.770 --> 05:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
the addressing the housing crisis within
 
05:40:39.410 --> 05:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
that are three programs the first
 
05:40:41.810 --> 05:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
program is a Planning and Zoning grant
 
05:40:43.730 --> 05:40:43.740 align:start position:0%
program to help communities that choose
 
05:40:45.830 --> 05:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
to look at their planning and zoning
 
05:40:48.288 --> 05:40:48.298 align:start position:0%
rules whether they want to update those
 
05:40:52.128 --> 05:40:52.138 align:start position:0%
or they want to look at making changes a
 
05:40:54.230 --> 05:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
lot of times the cost of doing that
 
05:40:56.690 --> 05:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
through a consultant or otherwise is a
 
05:40:58.788 --> 05:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
prohibitive cost on that municipality so
 
05:41:00.770 --> 05:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
these funds are made available for them
 
05:41:03.590 --> 05:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to accomplish that there are
 
05:41:07.270 --> 05:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
also funds that we are currently
 
05:41:10.910 --> 05:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
dispersing that are related to the
 
05:41:15.110 --> 05:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
demolition of of properties in a
 
05:41:19.390 --> 05:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
municipal reality that would assist in
 
05:41:21.708 --> 05:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
improving the housing situation in that
 
05:41:23.628 --> 05:41:23.638 align:start position:0%
Community we're seeing the first round
 
05:41:26.270 --> 05:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
of those funds starting to disperse now
 
05:41:29.330 --> 05:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
and then the final program is designed
 
05:41:32.110 --> 05:41:32.120 align:start position:0%
for municipalities who
 
05:41:35.930 --> 05:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
are permitting these types of Workforce
 
05:41:38.448 --> 05:41:38.458 align:start position:0%
housing units in their community and
 
05:41:40.810 --> 05:41:40.820 align:start position:0%
allowing them to apply for
 
05:41:43.550 --> 05:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
a grant in the amount of ten thousand
 
05:41:48.350 --> 05:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
dollars per unit of of permitted units
 
05:41:51.050 --> 05:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
in their communities and that those
 
05:41:52.850 --> 05:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
grants are pretty flexible in terms of
 
05:41:55.310 --> 05:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
what they can be used for so all that
 
05:41:57.530 --> 05:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
total is uh is a hundred million dollar
 
05:42:00.470 --> 05:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
program now what's an hb2
 
05:42:02.690 --> 05:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry go ahead everybody's trying to
 
05:42:07.270 --> 05:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
find this it's page 20 sections 40 45 to
 
05:42:11.390 --> 05:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:14.750 --> 05:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that representative
 
05:42:16.250 --> 05:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
yeah I should if you need me to stop
 
05:42:18.910 --> 05:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
just start waving sometimes I get going
 
05:42:23.330 --> 05:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
invest New Hampshire started on page 19.
 
05:42:26.770 --> 05:42:26.780 align:start position:0%
was section 43. okay
 
05:42:31.610 --> 05:42:31.620 align:start position:0%
so under hb2 there is a request for 30
 
05:42:34.850 --> 05:42:34.860 align:start position:0%
million dollars uh to that would
 
05:42:38.150 --> 05:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
effectively go toward the
 
05:42:39.890 --> 05:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
um the first program that I was
 
05:42:41.410 --> 05:42:41.420 align:start position:0%
described in the capital grant program
 
05:42:45.050 --> 05:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
uh when we ran that program uh we gave
 
05:42:46.850 --> 05:42:46.860 align:start position:0%
30 Awards
 
05:42:49.250 --> 05:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
to projects all around the state we had
 
05:42:51.890 --> 05:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
150 applications most of which I would
 
05:42:54.230 --> 05:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
say 90 of those were eligible projects
 
05:42:57.530 --> 05:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
so we really felt that there was a
 
05:42:59.628 --> 05:42:59.638 align:start position:0%
substantial need that still existed for
 
05:43:02.690 --> 05:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
that type of funding and so the governor
 
05:43:06.230 --> 05:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
included 30 million dollars in his
 
05:43:10.190 --> 05:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
budget to effectively do a second round
 
05:43:13.070 --> 05:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
of that program
 
05:43:15.830 --> 05:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
and again this is all General funds yes
 
05:43:15.840 --> 05:43:16.550 align:start position:0%
and again this is all General funds yes
sir

05:43:16.550 --> 05:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
sir
 
05:43:23.030 --> 05:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:25.550 --> 05:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative Schultz thank you
 
05:43:28.070 --> 05:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
so when you by the way I'm very happy
 
05:43:29.448 --> 05:43:29.458 align:start position:0%
that you're not just talking about
 
05:43:32.628 --> 05:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
so-called Workforce housing which I
 
05:43:35.628 --> 05:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
assume to be at the higher end pay but
 
05:43:37.670 --> 05:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
you also are talking about affordable
 
05:43:39.590 --> 05:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
housing because you can't have one
 
05:43:41.930 --> 05:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
without the other correct by way of a
 
05:43:41.940 --> 05:43:42.770 align:start position:0%
without the other correct by way of a
market

05:43:42.770 --> 05:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
market
 
05:43:45.650 --> 05:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
you also need workers who don't make
 
05:43:48.230 --> 05:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
higher wages so but what is the
 
05:43:50.090 --> 05:43:50.100 align:start position:0%
definition or sort of cut off as we
 
05:43:52.730 --> 05:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
continue to have that conversation do
 
05:43:55.548 --> 05:43:55.558 align:start position:0%
you have a like um a press a price point
 
05:43:59.330 --> 05:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
for rentals or houses in mind we do so
 
05:44:03.830 --> 05:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
we use a a figure that equates to 80 of
 
05:44:06.230 --> 05:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
the area median income or below
 
05:44:08.510 --> 05:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
so in order to be eligible for the funds
 
05:44:10.850 --> 05:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
under the program that I described the
 
05:44:13.548 --> 05:44:13.558 align:start position:0%
the capital grant program uh the units
 
05:44:16.490 --> 05:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
that are being funded have to uh be at
 
05:44:18.610 --> 05:44:18.620 align:start position:0%
80 or below
 
05:44:20.810 --> 05:44:20.820 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
05:44:23.750 --> 05:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
05:44:29.090 --> 05:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:35.150 --> 05:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:39.530 --> 05:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:45.310 --> 05:44:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:47.570 --> 05:44:47.580 align:start position:0%
Melissa Mr Hoffman I'll go ahead
 
05:44:49.910 --> 05:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative thank you so so there
 
05:44:52.250 --> 05:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
seems to be two similar ones the the
 
05:44:55.368 --> 05:44:55.378 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund 25 million and
 
05:44:57.590 --> 05:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
invest in age 30 million so how do they
 
05:45:00.350 --> 05:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
oh right how do they differ so the
 
05:45:02.990 --> 05:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund is a fund that
 
05:45:04.910 --> 05:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
is administered by New Hampshire Housing
 
05:45:08.270 --> 05:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority and so last I believe
 
05:45:10.548 --> 05:45:10.558 align:start position:0%
in the last biennium
 
05:45:13.010 --> 05:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
um there was also a very similar
 
05:45:15.470 --> 05:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
provision to provide 25 million dollars
 
05:45:19.430 --> 05:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
to um to capitalize that program uh this
 
05:45:22.190 --> 05:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
would do that same thing again so not
 
05:45:24.288 --> 05:45:24.298 align:start position:0%
within Bea but under New Hampshire
 
05:45:24.298 --> 05:45:25.548 align:start position:0%
within Bea but under New Hampshire
housing

05:45:25.548 --> 05:45:25.558 align:start position:0%
housing
 
05:45:29.030 --> 05:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's the 25 the 30 is for for the the
 
05:45:33.350 --> 05:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
invest in age is the 25 loans or is it
 
05:45:37.250 --> 05:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
no I I I'm I'm not 100 certain exactly
 
05:45:38.868 --> 05:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
how they use the funds but I do know
 
05:45:41.510 --> 05:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
that it is a grant program that they use
 
05:45:44.690 --> 05:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
to help supplement uh projects that they
 
05:45:46.788 --> 05:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
fund under the low income housing tax
 
05:45:49.610 --> 05:45:49.620 align:start position:0%
credit program so good the the same
 
05:45:52.310 --> 05:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
organization get grants from both
 
05:45:55.010 --> 05:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
of course yes
 
05:45:57.110 --> 05:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
and that's not a I should say that's not
 
05:45:58.910 --> 05:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
atypical in the world of Housing
 
05:46:02.330 --> 05:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
Development uh oftentimes when you're
 
05:46:04.250 --> 05:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
talking about projects that have
 
05:46:08.868 --> 05:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
anywhere between 15 or 500 units there
 
05:46:10.910 --> 05:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
are multiple funding sources that are
 
05:46:13.910 --> 05:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
used in order to achieve that across a
 
05:46:17.868 --> 05:46:17.878 align:start position:0%
whole host of state and federal entities
 
05:46:20.690 --> 05:46:20.700 align:start position:0%
another question yes thank you I and I I
 
05:46:23.150 --> 05:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
thought I heard you say that to apply
 
05:46:26.628 --> 05:46:26.638 align:start position:0%
this has to be an existing project in
 
05:46:28.250 --> 05:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
some sense the project's already started
 
05:46:31.310 --> 05:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
well yes so we wanted basically shovel
 
05:46:33.830 --> 05:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
ready projects we didn't want and again
 
05:46:36.410 --> 05:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
under the under the I should reiterate
 
05:46:39.048 --> 05:46:39.058 align:start position:0%
that under arpa we have to have all
 
05:46:41.930 --> 05:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
funds obligated by the end of 2024 and
 
05:46:44.390 --> 05:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
we have to have all funds expended by
 
05:46:47.930 --> 05:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
the end of 2026. so in the world of
 
05:46:50.510 --> 05:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
development construction that's not far
 
05:46:53.390 --> 05:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
away so we weren't looking to to use
 
05:46:55.730 --> 05:46:55.740 align:start position:0%
those funds to get into projects that
 
05:46:57.170 --> 05:46:57.180 align:start position:0%
are just now you know getting in the
 
05:46:59.330 --> 05:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
ground we needed projects that were
 
05:47:01.310 --> 05:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
experiencing funding shortfalls either
 
05:47:03.010 --> 05:47:03.020 align:start position:0%
in their Capital stack or through
 
05:47:05.090 --> 05:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
inflationary costs that you know of
 
05:47:08.230 --> 05:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
supplies or labor costs or something so
 
05:47:10.610 --> 05:47:10.620 align:start position:0%
we were looking for projects that had
 
05:47:12.708 --> 05:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
already been permitted and and to some
 
05:47:15.230 --> 05:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
degree were ready to to Begin work
 
05:47:16.670 --> 05:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
immediately so that they could be done
 
05:47:19.010 --> 05:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
in time to expend those under the arpa
 
05:47:21.110 --> 05:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
deadlines but these new things that's
 
05:47:22.788 --> 05:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
not our this is that's correct General
 
05:47:24.590 --> 05:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
funds that's right we don't have those
 
05:47:31.070 --> 05:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:33.708 --> 05:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
questions representative people no I
 
05:47:35.750 --> 05:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
don't I was just looking at
 
05:47:37.788 --> 05:47:37.798 align:start position:0%
Melissa yes
 
05:47:40.190 --> 05:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
sure I have a few of them to go through
 
05:47:41.510 --> 05:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
if you want a couple of them we can
 
05:47:43.850 --> 05:47:43.860 align:start position:0%
start uh section 40 which is the office
 
05:47:45.830 --> 05:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
of regulatory review reduction in
 
05:47:49.548 --> 05:47:49.558 align:start position:0%
government efficiency yes uh so this is
 
05:47:52.250 --> 05:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
a uh that's page 16.
 
05:47:55.310 --> 05:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
thank you myself this is a program that
 
05:47:56.930 --> 05:47:56.940 align:start position:0%
the governor has asked to have
 
05:47:59.628 --> 05:47:59.638 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to Bea it's
 
05:48:02.570 --> 05:48:02.580 align:start position:0%
not a program or Pro or a uh or a unit
 
05:48:03.890 --> 05:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
of government that we would have
 
05:48:06.350 --> 05:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily authority over but the idea
 
05:48:09.470 --> 05:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
with this is to look at
 
05:48:11.750 --> 05:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
um state regulations that are
 
05:48:14.090 --> 05:48:14.100 align:start position:0%
administered by state agencies from the
 
05:48:16.850 --> 05:48:16.860 align:start position:0%
perspective of an employer whether
 
05:48:18.650 --> 05:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
that's a for-profit or non-profit
 
05:48:22.850 --> 05:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
employer and be able to have some degree
 
05:48:27.190 --> 05:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
of input on behalf of those employers
 
05:48:30.770 --> 05:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
as part of the rulemaking process it
 
05:48:34.810 --> 05:48:34.820 align:start position:0%
also allows for an opportunity for
 
05:48:38.110 --> 05:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
the state to look at the way that
 
05:48:41.288 --> 05:48:41.298 align:start position:0%
different let's say big picture
 
05:48:43.970 --> 05:48:43.980 align:start position:0%
programs and initiatives are
 
05:48:47.690 --> 05:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
administered so for example
 
05:48:49.730 --> 05:48:49.740 align:start position:0%
um you know child care where there might
 
05:48:51.708 --> 05:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
be multiple agencies that are involved
 
05:48:55.610 --> 05:48:55.620 align:start position:0%
in in initiatives that are designed to
 
05:48:58.190 --> 05:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
help address the child care issue in the
 
05:49:01.390 --> 05:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
state this would allow this organization
 
05:49:05.570 --> 05:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
to take a look at all of those programs
 
05:49:07.970 --> 05:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
how they interact with each other and
 
05:49:10.190 --> 05:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
seek to improve the interaction of that
 
05:49:11.448 --> 05:49:11.458 align:start position:0%
and that's the government efficiency
 
05:49:13.150 --> 05:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
side of things so
 
05:49:16.070 --> 05:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's really sort of the overview of
 
05:49:16.080 --> 05:49:17.208 align:start position:0%
that's really sort of the overview of
this

05:49:17.208 --> 05:49:17.218 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:49:18.708 --> 05:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
um there that I think there is a
 
05:49:22.090 --> 05:49:22.100 align:start position:0%
provision for three or four staff people
 
05:49:26.330 --> 05:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
to administer this office and again I
 
05:49:29.090 --> 05:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
would say the role of ba is purely from
 
05:49:31.128 --> 05:49:31.138 align:start position:0%
an administrative standpoint to help
 
05:49:34.670 --> 05:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
this entity meet their needs uh from an
 
05:49:36.110 --> 05:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
administrative standpoint
 
05:49:40.010 --> 05:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
so the sum of 750 000 that would be
 
05:49:44.090 --> 05:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
all General funds pretty soon now do you
 
05:49:47.930 --> 05:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
have a budget with any breakdown of the
 
05:49:51.530 --> 05:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
750 uh I do not but I could tell you
 
05:49:53.150 --> 05:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
that it would be almost all exclusively
 
05:49:56.448 --> 05:49:56.458 align:start position:0%
for salaries maybe with you know with
 
05:49:58.368 --> 05:49:58.378 align:start position:0%
the supporting costs for technology and
 
05:50:00.530 --> 05:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
so on but it would just be basically in
 
05:50:02.868 --> 05:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
that category
 
05:50:05.448 --> 05:50:05.458 align:start position:0%
area we'll take a look at that yeah
 
05:50:10.548 --> 05:50:10.558 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire so on page 17 line of
 
05:50:13.310 --> 05:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
the House Bill 2 line 18 there's a
 
05:50:15.410 --> 05:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
section here that says the objective
 
05:50:17.690 --> 05:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
scoring criteria
 
05:50:19.970 --> 05:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
Etc what are the what is being scored
 
05:50:22.368 --> 05:50:22.378 align:start position:0%
what are they talking about so I that's
 
05:50:24.470 --> 05:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
a mechanism that was designed to be able
 
05:50:30.048 --> 05:50:30.058 align:start position:0%
to uh allow this entity to look at new
 
05:50:33.590 --> 05:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
regulations from the standpoint of a
 
05:50:35.330 --> 05:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
scoring Matrix that they would
 
05:50:38.990 --> 05:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
themselves develop in order to measure
 
05:50:40.548 --> 05:50:40.558 align:start position:0%
the potential
 
05:50:43.548 --> 05:50:43.558 align:start position:0%
a positive or negative impact of those
 
05:50:43.558 --> 05:50:45.110 align:start position:0%
a positive or negative impact of those
regulations

05:50:45.110 --> 05:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
05:50:47.510 --> 05:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's I believe it's designed to be just
 
05:50:50.448 --> 05:50:50.458 align:start position:0%
basically a prioritization system
 
05:50:57.048 --> 05:50:57.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:59.868 --> 05:50:59.878 align:start position:0%
all right Melissa next
 
05:51:02.150 --> 05:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
sure I think the last part is on page
 
05:51:02.160 --> 05:51:03.288 align:start position:0%
sure I think the last part is on page
five

05:51:03.288 --> 05:51:03.298 align:start position:0%
five
 
05:51:04.670 --> 05:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
um there's just some various Provisions
 
05:51:08.330 --> 05:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
from section 58 to section 63.
 
05:51:11.090 --> 05:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
if like repeals Department of DEA
 
05:51:13.070 --> 05:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
Department of B it looks like cleanup
 
05:51:15.708 --> 05:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
language yeah so these last Provisions
 
05:51:18.590 --> 05:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
are are related to
 
05:51:21.530 --> 05:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
um sort of the ongoing development over
 
05:51:24.110 --> 05:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
time since we split dread up there were
 
05:51:25.970 --> 05:51:25.980 align:start position:0%
a number of Provisions that carried into
 
05:51:29.448 --> 05:51:29.458 align:start position:0%
our statute that we really don't have
 
05:51:32.628 --> 05:51:32.638 align:start position:0%
any have no operational function
 
05:51:36.590 --> 05:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
so we just wanted to clean those up and
 
05:51:49.970 --> 05:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:59.570 --> 05:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:03.350 --> 05:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
so this man sure absolutely yeah so this
 
05:52:06.288 --> 05:52:06.298 align:start position:0%
new chapter 12 piece stuff is all about
 
05:52:10.010 --> 05:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and so I'd like to ask Carol
 
05:52:13.368 --> 05:52:13.378 align:start position:0%
about it and give comments sorry oh
 
05:52:16.070 --> 05:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely so we'll ask representative
 
05:52:18.288 --> 05:52:18.298 align:start position:0%
Carol Maguire to take a look at this
 
05:52:18.298 --> 05:52:19.548 align:start position:0%
Carol Maguire to take a look at this
section

05:52:19.548 --> 05:52:19.558 align:start position:0%
section
 
05:52:22.510 --> 05:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
take care of that representative
 
05:52:25.250 --> 05:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
or something yeah write a very detailed
 
05:52:25.260 --> 05:52:26.090 align:start position:0%
or something yeah write a very detailed
letter

05:52:26.090 --> 05:52:26.100 align:start position:0%
letter
 
05:52:26.100 --> 05:52:27.890 align:start position:0%
letter
yeah

05:52:27.890 --> 05:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:52:30.948 --> 05:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
question sure so on page 83 then section
 
05:52:35.090 --> 05:52:35.100 align:start position:0%
258 so you're repealing programs New
 
05:52:38.570 --> 05:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire grip micro Enterprise Relief
 
05:52:38.580 --> 05:52:40.070 align:start position:0%
Hampshire grip micro Enterprise Relief
Fund

05:52:40.070 --> 05:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
Fund
 
05:52:42.708 --> 05:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
those are those are programs that came
 
05:52:45.470 --> 05:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
up during covid uh that we haven't
 
05:52:48.948 --> 05:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
really been able sought to operate and
 
05:52:50.208 --> 05:52:50.218 align:start position:0%
have not been successful in their
 
05:52:51.890 --> 05:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
operation or have not been necessary so
 
05:52:55.970 --> 05:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 micro Enterprise program
 
05:52:58.368 --> 05:52:58.378 align:start position:0%
um when we when we ran the at the state
 
05:53:00.948 --> 05:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
level the Main Street Relief Fund and
 
05:53:02.690 --> 05:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
the gap program and the cell phone so
 
05:53:05.208 --> 05:53:05.218 align:start position:0%
those programs generally took care of
 
05:53:07.670 --> 05:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
those populations so they were passed
 
05:53:10.070 --> 05:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
and they were included in our statute
 
05:53:11.390 --> 05:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
um but in the end we felt pretty
 
05:53:14.448 --> 05:53:14.458 align:start position:0%
strongly that those resources had been
 
05:53:16.610 --> 05:53:16.620 align:start position:0%
deployed effectively to the same
 
05:53:16.620 --> 05:53:20.030 align:start position:0%
deployed effectively to the same
populations

05:53:20.030 --> 05:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:22.190 --> 05:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
over there nope
 
05:53:26.868 --> 05:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
so was it just 258 you have to vote on
 
05:53:29.150 --> 05:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do
 
05:53:32.270 --> 05:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
it's 258 through 263.
 
05:53:32.280 --> 05:53:34.910 align:start position:0%
it's 258 through 263.
63.

05:53:34.910 --> 05:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
63.
 
05:53:37.010 --> 05:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask the
 
05:53:40.070 --> 05:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
Edna committee to take a look
 
05:53:42.890 --> 05:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
votes items
 
05:53:45.770 --> 05:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
Melissa you got that those several items
 
05:53:49.250 --> 05:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:50.690 --> 05:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
05:53:54.830 --> 05:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:57.590 --> 05:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
there was a Sweeney my name is Chairman
 
05:53:59.448 --> 05:53:59.458 align:start position:0%
so I do have a question about the letter
 
05:54:03.470 --> 05:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
from sbdc so it states that if the if we
 
05:54:04.970 --> 05:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
were to do the additional funding to get
 
05:54:08.390 --> 05:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
it to 500 000 uh they would likely hire
 
05:54:10.788 --> 05:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
a full-time business advisor to support
 
05:54:13.548 --> 05:54:13.558 align:start position:0%
the Biotech Industry can we can we just
 
05:54:16.670 --> 05:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
go over the need for that I'm sort of
 
05:54:19.430 --> 05:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
so I I'm aware of Army and other larger
 
05:54:21.530 --> 05:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
players in the field but in terms of
 
05:54:24.048 --> 05:54:24.058 align:start position:0%
other businesses emerging in the biotech
 
05:54:26.270 --> 05:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
what is the role a business advisor
 
05:54:28.070 --> 05:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
these seem like established firms that
 
05:54:30.288 --> 05:54:30.298 align:start position:0%
would have a business advisor of their
 
05:54:33.770 --> 05:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
own I I would say uh that first off that
 
05:54:36.470 --> 05:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
biotechs and life science sector is one
 
05:54:38.150 --> 05:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
of the fastest growing in the state
 
05:54:40.970 --> 05:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
right now and so what we're seeing is
 
05:54:42.770 --> 05:54:42.780 align:start position:0%
yes there are larger companies like
 
05:54:45.288 --> 05:54:45.298 align:start position:0%
lonza where some of the programs that
 
05:54:46.670 --> 05:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
are running through the Army project in
 
05:54:49.070 --> 05:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester absolutely but what they are
 
05:54:53.030 --> 05:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
doing is spinning off a lot of of other
 
05:54:55.128 --> 05:54:55.138 align:start position:0%
companies that are in that same space
 
05:54:57.410 --> 05:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
and looking to take advantage of the
 
05:54:59.868 --> 05:54:59.878 align:start position:0%
resources the workforce that we're
 
05:55:01.430 --> 05:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
seeing that's increasing in New
 
05:55:02.990 --> 05:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as it relates to this space
 
05:55:05.448 --> 05:55:05.458 align:start position:0%
and the access to the workforce just to
 
05:55:07.670 --> 05:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
our Southern border of people who maybe
 
05:55:09.730 --> 05:55:09.740 align:start position:0%
want to come in the other direction so
 
05:55:13.610 --> 05:55:13.620 align:start position:0%
we do see a substantial
 
05:55:17.750 --> 05:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
um Competitive Edge that we uh can take
 
05:55:20.330 --> 05:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
advantage of in New Hampshire to help
 
05:55:21.970 --> 05:55:21.980 align:start position:0%
grow this industry
 
05:55:25.910 --> 05:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide and we've seen for example at
 
05:55:27.890 --> 05:55:27.900 align:start position:0%
least one company that has chosen to
 
05:55:32.330 --> 05:55:32.340 align:start position:0%
locate its U.S headquarters in Keene and
 
05:55:35.208 --> 05:55:35.218 align:start position:0%
associate with Keene State College so
 
05:55:37.548 --> 05:55:37.558 align:start position:0%
they do seek to be near research centers
 
05:55:39.590 --> 05:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
whether it's our academic centers or in
 
05:55:41.930 --> 05:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
some cases our community colleges but
 
05:55:44.930 --> 05:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
the ability for the state through sbdc
 
05:55:47.628 --> 05:55:47.638 align:start position:0%
and through ba to be able to facilitate
 
05:55:50.628 --> 05:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
that activity is definitely a priority
 
05:55:51.948 --> 05:55:51.958 align:start position:0%
for the Department
 
05:55:56.330 --> 05:55:56.340 align:start position:0%
follow-up sure thank you so I I agree
 
05:55:59.030 --> 05:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
completely with the growing biotech this
 
05:56:00.288 --> 05:56:00.298 align:start position:0%
does say it would just be for the
 
05:56:02.868 --> 05:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
greater Manchester region and it seems
 
05:56:04.670 --> 05:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
like we would need such a role Statewide
 
05:56:07.670 --> 05:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
for the Keynes for Seacoast with lonza
 
05:56:09.590 --> 05:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
and so I well I don't want to speak for
 
05:56:13.970 --> 05:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
for Miss gray but I think uh you know uh
 
05:56:16.610 --> 05:56:16.620 align:start position:0%
the Army project itself is throwing off
 
05:56:18.470 --> 05:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
a substantial amount of this activity
 
05:56:21.250 --> 05:56:21.260 align:start position:0%
and it is not necessarily always
 
05:56:23.270 --> 05:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
specifically around regenerative
 
05:56:25.670 --> 05:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
medicine or regenerative manufacturing
 
05:56:28.548 --> 05:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
it is around a space that takes that
 
05:56:30.890 --> 05:56:30.900 align:start position:0%
same sort of skill set of an individual
 
05:56:33.170 --> 05:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
in a Workforce and it brings them to New
 
05:56:35.090 --> 05:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're looking at companies
 
05:56:37.730 --> 05:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
that are seeing that value and May and
 
05:56:39.230 --> 05:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
are increasingly willing to make an
 
05:56:41.628 --> 05:56:41.638 align:start position:0%
investment in New Hampshire so yes there
 
05:56:42.948 --> 05:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
is a bit of an epicenter that's
 
05:56:45.708 --> 05:56:45.718 align:start position:0%
occurring in Manchester but again as I
 
05:56:47.690 --> 05:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned we have a very strong
 
05:56:50.628 --> 05:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
relationship with sbdc so whatever work
 
05:56:52.310 --> 05:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
is being done in that space is something
 
05:56:53.750 --> 05:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to be shared with our team
 
05:56:56.510 --> 05:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
at Bea that then does go Statewide and
 
05:56:58.548 --> 05:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to say that at some
 
05:57:00.230 --> 05:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
point as we continue to see growth in
 
05:57:01.970 --> 05:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
that sector that they would go beyond
 
05:57:05.150 --> 05:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
just the purely Manchester space thank
 
05:57:07.730 --> 05:57:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:10.010 --> 05:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
so I know there are some questions on
 
05:57:12.250 --> 05:57:12.260 align:start position:0%
ARP right now that we've got there
 
05:57:18.350 --> 05:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:22.010 --> 05:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
it's a question I mean I just it keeps
 
05:57:24.230 --> 05:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
coming up maybe we can use arpa funds
 
05:57:26.270 --> 05:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
for this and maybe we can use arpa funds
 
05:57:28.610 --> 05:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
for this and everybody says it with
 
05:57:32.510 --> 05:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
great hope and Glee yeah but um you know
 
05:57:34.128 --> 05:57:34.138 align:start position:0%
there are several infrastructure
 
05:57:36.110 --> 05:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
projects for instance that are being
 
05:57:38.090 --> 05:57:38.100 align:start position:0%
proposed so we thought what better
 
05:57:42.110 --> 05:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
person to ask about it and you so Youth
 
05:57:44.990 --> 05:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
Development Centers right but there are
 
05:57:48.410 --> 05:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
other buildings in here so uh just in in
 
05:57:51.830 --> 05:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
the at the very highest level I guess
 
05:57:54.230 --> 05:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
um right now you're gonna under arpa
 
05:57:56.810 --> 05:57:56.820 align:start position:0%
there are a number of different funding
 
05:57:59.930 --> 05:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
programs the one that gopher the
 
05:58:02.470 --> 05:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
organization that I run in my spare time
 
05:58:06.110 --> 05:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
is uh what is responsible for What's
 
05:58:07.910 --> 05:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
called the state fiscal recovery funds
 
05:58:10.368 --> 05:58:10.378 align:start position:0%
so those are among the most flexible
 
05:58:13.128 --> 05:58:13.138 align:start position:0%
arpa funds that the state received the
 
05:58:15.830 --> 05:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
total we received under that program was
 
05:58:18.708 --> 05:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
around 990 million dollars
 
05:58:22.090 --> 05:58:22.100 align:start position:0%
uh we received that now back in
 
05:58:26.930 --> 05:58:26.940 align:start position:0%
2021 as I recall so uh as of our latest
 
05:58:30.230 --> 05:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
work with the joint fiscal committee uh
 
05:58:32.868 --> 05:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
we are we have crossed over 920 million
 
05:58:34.670 --> 05:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
dollars that has been obligated into
 
05:58:36.770 --> 05:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
that program so what that basically
 
05:58:40.128 --> 05:58:40.138 align:start position:0%
means is that we are rapidly approaching
 
05:58:43.610 --> 05:58:43.620 align:start position:0%
um uh the end of uh available funds to
 
05:58:46.150 --> 05:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
obligate under the sfrf
 
05:58:48.048 --> 05:58:48.058 align:start position:0%
you've heard me talk a lot about
 
05:58:50.628 --> 05:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
Broadband uh that is another program
 
05:58:53.270 --> 05:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
that we receive funding under arpa under
 
05:58:55.070 --> 05:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
a separate program called the capital
 
05:58:58.010 --> 05:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
projects fund uh that is one of the
 
05:59:00.410 --> 05:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
infrastructure type Investments that we
 
05:59:03.670 --> 05:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
are able to make under arpa and that is
 
05:59:07.430 --> 05:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
separate from this this fiscal Recovery
 
05:59:07.440 --> 05:59:08.690 align:start position:0%
separate from this this fiscal Recovery
Fund

05:59:08.690 --> 05:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
Fund
 
05:59:11.150 --> 05:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
um and it that total is 122 million
 
05:59:16.070 --> 05:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
dollars we have a cat we have obligated
 
05:59:18.470 --> 05:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
um virtually all of that fund at this
 
05:59:21.708 --> 05:59:21.718 align:start position:0%
point for Broadband Investments but I
 
05:59:25.730 --> 05:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
would say on the Broadband thread there
 
05:59:29.448 --> 05:59:29.458 align:start position:0%
is and and relevant to the discussion is
 
05:59:31.490 --> 05:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh there are also funds that the federal
 
05:59:33.590 --> 05:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
government is providing under what they
 
05:59:35.868 --> 05:59:35.878 align:start position:0%
initially call the iija or the
 
05:59:37.368 --> 05:59:37.378 align:start position:0%
infrastructure investment something
 
05:59:41.330 --> 05:59:41.340 align:start position:0%
something act uh and has is now called I
 
05:59:45.368 --> 05:59:45.378 align:start position:0%
think the bipartisan infrastructure law
 
05:59:48.288 --> 05:59:48.298 align:start position:0%
but in any case there will be additional
 
05:59:49.970 --> 05:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
funds that the state will receive for
 
05:59:53.270 --> 05:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
Broadband under that program and so when
 
05:59:55.250 --> 05:59:55.260 align:start position:0%
we start to talk about infrastructure
 
05:59:56.930 --> 05:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
and the Investments that are needed to
 
05:59:58.070 --> 05:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
be made there
 
06:00:00.650 --> 06:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
most of the funding that will be
 
06:00:02.230 --> 06:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
available from the federal government
 
06:00:05.350 --> 06:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
for these recovery type of
 
06:00:10.128 --> 06:00:10.138 align:start position:0%
resources will be under the iija funding
 
06:00:12.170 --> 06:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
that is going to be primarily
 
06:00:13.610 --> 06:00:13.620 align:start position:0%
administered by the Department of
 
06:00:15.890 --> 06:00:15.900 align:start position:0%
Transportation so gopher does not have a
 
06:00:18.850 --> 06:00:18.860 align:start position:0%
role with iija we are exclusively the
 
06:00:21.650 --> 06:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
sfrf people and I'm sorry to kill you
 
06:00:23.990 --> 06:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
with acronyms but that's uh when we deal
 
06:00:25.490 --> 06:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
with the federal government we tend to
 
06:00:27.530 --> 06:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
see a lot of them
 
06:00:30.350 --> 06:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
so if we could get a definitive answer
 
06:00:32.628 --> 06:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
as far as like the Youth Development
 
06:00:35.150 --> 06:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
Center there's folks have said we can
 
06:00:36.770 --> 06:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
get our upper funds and as you probably
 
06:00:38.390 --> 06:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
know the figure that's being tossed
 
06:00:41.570 --> 06:00:41.580 align:start position:0%
around is about 21 million is that
 
06:00:44.208 --> 06:00:44.218 align:start position:0%
realistic to anticipate we could get our
 
06:00:46.190 --> 06:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
profunds for this it's hard to say and I
 
06:00:47.690 --> 06:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
would have to go back and check with the
 
06:00:50.330 --> 06:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
Gopher staff and see exactly what's in
 
06:00:51.890 --> 06:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
the pipeline right now and whether that
 
06:00:54.048 --> 06:00:54.058 align:start position:0%
is in the pipeline I don't know that
 
06:00:56.208 --> 06:00:56.218 align:start position:0%
right off the top of my head
 
06:00:57.288 --> 06:00:57.298 align:start position:0%
um but
 
06:00:59.990 --> 06:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I will say on the Gopher website you
 
06:01:02.030 --> 06:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
can get a you can get a list of all of
 
06:01:04.190 --> 06:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
the funds that fiscal committee has and
 
06:01:05.628 --> 06:01:05.638 align:start position:0%
programs and projects that have been
 
06:01:07.490 --> 06:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
approved there and broken out by
 
06:01:08.990 --> 06:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
specific areas so whether they're
 
06:01:11.570 --> 06:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
infrastructure or so on a good portion
 
06:01:14.208 --> 06:01:14.218 align:start position:0%
of the funds early on that we made were
 
06:01:16.128 --> 06:01:16.138 align:start position:0%
in the infrastructure category for water
 
06:01:18.830 --> 06:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
and sewer Investments and again we made
 
06:01:20.868 --> 06:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
those Investments very early because of
 
06:01:24.070 --> 06:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
the runway that's necessary for
 
06:01:27.048 --> 06:01:27.058 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects and recognizing
 
06:01:28.850 --> 06:01:28.860 align:start position:0%
that we have an end date for the use of
 
06:01:32.868 --> 06:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:32.878 --> 06:01:34.788 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:01:34.788 --> 06:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:01:38.810 --> 06:01:38.820 align:start position:0%
there's 70 million dollars left right so
 
06:01:40.730 --> 06:01:40.740 align:start position:0%
does it have to really so it doesn't
 
06:01:42.890 --> 06:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
have to relate to covid and I'm trying
 
06:01:44.390 --> 06:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
we're trying to understand what some of
 
06:01:47.270 --> 06:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
the guard rails are on the use of the
 
06:01:49.610 --> 06:01:49.620 align:start position:0%
money I mean I'd be happy to send you
 
06:01:52.368 --> 06:01:52.378 align:start position:0%
several of the funding requests in here
 
06:01:55.010 --> 06:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
for buildings for instance yes
 
06:01:57.350 --> 06:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
06:01:59.208 --> 06:01:59.218 align:start position:0%
treasury the Department of Treasury in
 
06:02:01.490 --> 06:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
Washington gives us literally dozens of
 
06:02:03.590 --> 06:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
expenditure categories that all have you
 
06:02:05.208 --> 06:02:05.218 align:start position:0%
know and we have to qualify each
 
06:02:08.330 --> 06:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
individual program and project under uh
 
06:02:09.948 --> 06:02:09.958 align:start position:0%
and that's increasingly the role that
 
06:02:11.930 --> 06:02:11.940 align:start position:0%
gopher plays is to just make sure that
 
06:02:13.970 --> 06:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
we are within the eligible spending
 
06:02:16.128 --> 06:02:16.138 align:start position:0%
categories and expenditure categories
 
06:02:17.868 --> 06:02:17.878 align:start position:0%
that we report on regularly to the
 
06:02:18.830 --> 06:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
06:02:22.070 --> 06:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
so uh yes the program is designed to be
 
06:02:24.948 --> 06:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
a covered recovery uh and and relief
 
06:02:27.288 --> 06:02:27.298 align:start position:0%
program but at the same time they do
 
06:02:28.610 --> 06:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
allow some pretty substantial
 
06:02:30.530 --> 06:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
investments in things like
 
06:02:32.510 --> 06:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in things like Economic
 
06:02:35.030 --> 06:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
Development health care and so on where
 
06:02:37.250 --> 06:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
we've been seeing those resources put
 
06:02:40.930 --> 06:02:40.940 align:start position:0%
over the last two years under arpa
 
06:02:45.830 --> 06:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
so it is uh it is in its impetus a
 
06:02:48.890 --> 06:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
covert recovery program but it is a
 
06:02:55.130 --> 06:02:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:55.140 --> 06:02:58.850 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:02:58.850 --> 06:02:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:01.310 --> 06:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
building or something we would ask you
 
06:03:03.590 --> 06:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
whether that was
 
06:03:05.270 --> 06:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
something that we could use the money
 
06:03:06.708 --> 06:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
for would you have to check with
 
06:03:09.230 --> 06:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
Washington or there's just
 
06:03:11.990 --> 06:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
process is very confusing so that's
 
06:03:14.208 --> 06:03:14.218 align:start position:0%
really the again the role of the of the
 
06:03:17.090 --> 06:03:17.100 align:start position:0%
Gopher team and we have a team of I
 
06:03:18.410 --> 06:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
think we're about eight or nine people
 
06:03:20.990 --> 06:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
right now and their job is just as what
 
06:03:23.208 --> 06:03:23.218 align:start position:0%
you're saying we get a constant influx
 
06:03:25.610 --> 06:03:25.620 align:start position:0%
of requests both from within government
 
06:03:28.430 --> 06:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
and outside of government and you know
 
06:03:30.410 --> 06:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
the role that gopher plays is to look at
 
06:03:31.930 --> 06:03:31.940 align:start position:0%
all of those
 
06:03:34.190 --> 06:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
requests look at programs that are
 
06:03:36.170 --> 06:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
currently in existence look at the
 
06:03:38.330 --> 06:03:38.340 align:start position:0%
eligibility categories in expenditure
 
06:03:40.970 --> 06:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
categories look at the budgets and the
 
06:03:42.350 --> 06:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
types of programs that are being
 
06:03:46.510 --> 06:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
requested work with agencies to identify
 
06:03:50.930 --> 06:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
if those agencies are are able to deploy
 
06:03:53.330 --> 06:03:53.340 align:start position:0%
and Implement and comply with the
 
06:03:54.708 --> 06:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
regulations under each one of these
 
06:03:56.270 --> 06:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
resources and these these different
 
06:03:59.390 --> 06:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
programs and then you know then we work
 
06:04:01.070 --> 06:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
with joint fiscal committee and the
 
06:04:02.930 --> 06:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
executive Council to move those programs
 
06:04:02.940 --> 06:04:03.788 align:start position:0%
executive Council to move those programs
forward

06:04:03.788 --> 06:04:03.798 align:start position:0%
forward
 
06:04:08.150 --> 06:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
on the back end we our team also works
 
06:04:10.610 --> 06:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
with U.S treasury on on the compliance
 
06:04:12.350 --> 06:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
component of this and the good deal of
 
06:04:14.330 --> 06:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
federal reporting that goes on on a
 
06:04:17.390 --> 06:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis that is in great detail
 
06:04:20.510 --> 06:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
of where each dollar is being spent and
 
06:04:23.510 --> 06:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
how those funds are meeting all the
 
06:04:25.670 --> 06:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
compliance requirements so it's it's a
 
06:04:27.890 --> 06:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
fairly significant undertaking
 
06:04:30.470 --> 06:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
so do you folks then make the
 
06:04:33.110 --> 06:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations on how to deploy the
 
06:04:35.510 --> 06:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
funds based on the requests you get
 
06:04:38.868 --> 06:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
uh again what we do is we sort of do the
 
06:04:41.750 --> 06:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
Baseline work of making sure all of the
 
06:04:43.548 --> 06:04:43.558 align:start position:0%
pieces are in place and then we work
 
06:04:45.170 --> 06:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
with fiscal committee and make that
 
06:04:46.670 --> 06:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
presentation it's not always us that
 
06:04:49.070 --> 06:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
does it so in some cases you might have
 
06:04:52.310 --> 06:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
HHS or other departments that come
 
06:04:55.730 --> 06:04:55.740 align:start position:0%
forward with funds that are looking to
 
06:04:59.868 --> 06:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
use the sfrf funds under arpa and then

06:05:05.770 --> 06:05:05.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:08.628 --> 06:05:08.638 align:start position:0%

06:05:23.270 --> 06:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
ah just because I don't know about it
 
06:05:24.830 --> 06:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
