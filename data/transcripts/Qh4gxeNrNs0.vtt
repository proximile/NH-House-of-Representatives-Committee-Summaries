opportunity to re review the minutes
 
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.750 align:start position:0%
opportunity to re review the minutes
thank

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:54.949 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 align:start position:0%
the committee um of one thing and that
 
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
is the charge of this committee um and
 
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
so the charge of this committee as
 
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
outlined in 17616 DB Roman numeral one
 
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
is pretty clear it is hereby establish a
 
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
commission to study with the purpose of
 
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
proposing legislation of a state
 
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
controlled cannabis and cannabis
 
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
products right so understand we're not
 
00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
here to discuss legalization we're
 
00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
discussing how to put a bill forward
 
00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
that would do legalization but do it in
 
00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 align:start position:0%
a manner that is is most protective of
 
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 align:start position:0%
our citizens and and regulator and our
 
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
regulations so I I I want to be clear
 
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
that while I know we've had a lot of
 
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
discussion about legalization that
 
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
really isn't the charge of the
 
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
commission the charge of the commission
 
00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 align:start position:0%
is to put the best Bill forward possible
 
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
if legalization were to happen in a
 
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
state controlled model and so what we
 
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
look when we're talking to um the
 
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
various speakers or ourselves again what
 
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
do we need to add to a bill to take care
 
00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 align:start position:0%
of any concerns you may have about the
 
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh about legalization for our
 
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 align:start position:0%
citizens yes uh thank you Mr chair I
 
00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
just want to put forth a reminder that
 
00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
at our first meeting we agreed that we
 
00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 align:start position:0%
would be hearing from um experts from
 
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
legalized states with the impact to
 
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
investigate issues on the impact of
 
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
those States also hear about the impact
 
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
on on the health and safety of Youth and
 
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 align:start position:0%
Young adults and the impact on Mental
 
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
Health right and again I think but but
 
00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
again I I to to the charge of the
 
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
committee which is to put a bill forward
 
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
the goal is to take that information and
 
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
to make ours better than Colorado to
 
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
make our bill and our legalization
 
00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 align:start position:0%
better than col that might have had an
 
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
issue and so it's what do we need to put
 
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
into the bill to make the bill better um
 
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
so that we don't have the issues that we
 
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
done in other
 
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
states study study commission and with
 
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 align:start position:0%

committee I was ask by Katie to come
 
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
here uh to inform
 
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
deliberations rates of marijuana or
 
00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
cannabis use among teens is at its
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
highest in three decades THC which is a
 
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
psychoactive chemical made by cannabis
 
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
plants is an addictive substance that is
 
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
particularly harmful to brain
 
00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
development during the teen years while
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
many states have legalized cannabis
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
products products that contain THC
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
remain illegal by federal law therefore
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
the federal government does not Provide
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
support with regulation or oversight of
 
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
THC um based products as as it does does
 
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
for alcohol and nicotine regulation of
 
00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:42.199 align:start position:0%
addictive products is complex and States
 
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire lack the
 
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for doing so
 
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately at this time as a result
 
00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.199 align:start position:0%
state-based legalization of cannabis
 
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
products exposes the population of the
 
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
state to Public Health harms THC impacts
 
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
many areas of the brain uh which are
 
00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
important for almost everything
 
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
decision- making impulse control
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
of time cognition and even physical
 
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
coordination there is a strong
 
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
association between use of canvas
 
00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
products that contain THC and
 
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
psychiatric disorders most notably
 
00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
psychotic disorders use of cannabis
 
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
products particularly during youth is
 
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
associated with poor functional outcomes
 
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
even in adulthood most notably it lowers
 
00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
educational and ational achievement and
 
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:33.560 align:start position:0%
higher rates of mental health disorders
 
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
such as anxiety depression and psychosis
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
cannabis juice can also affect multiple
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
organs in our bodies like the lungs uh
 
00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:43.639 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular system through the vaping
 
00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
and smoking uh process uh also at Boston
 
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
Children's Hospital we have The Vaping
 
00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:50.919 align:start position:0%
Clinic where we're seeing young adults
 
00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
and teenagers for the first time uh
 
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
having issues with breathing shortness
 
00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:57.879 align:start position:0%
of breath decreased exercise tolerance
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
when you look at their lungs um um uh to
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
the help of chest x-rays or CT scans you
 
00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
see hyperinflated lungs um and and
 
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
consolidations which we normally see in
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
people with COPD and you know elderly
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
who've been smoking for
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
decades in Massachusetts where are
 
00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919 align:start position:0%
practice psychotic symptoms cannabis
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
hyperemesis syndrome and lung injury
 
00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
from vaping have become increasingly
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
common in fact these conditions were
 
00:08:26.909 --> 00:08:26.919 align:start position:0%
almost unheard of a decade ago I
 
00:08:28.149 --> 00:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
personally have dealt with several
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
patients who have experienced I
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
conditions due to cannabis use in the
 
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
past decade many states legalized the
 
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
recreational use of cannabis for adults
 
00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
21 and older while a Young Person's use
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
of cannabis remains illegal in all
 
00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:42.519 align:start position:0%
states the new laws increase the
 
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
availability overall making the drugs
 
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:47.720 align:start position:0%
much more likely to land in the hands of
 
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
teens furthermore legalization makes it
 
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
confusing for teenagers when assessing
 
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
the safety of using uh cannabis one of
 
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
the most common questions for example I
 
00:08:59.550 --> 00:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
get asked by my patients is is if
 
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
marijuana is so bad for you then why is
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
it becoming legal to use for uh every
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
everyone everywhere according to a study
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
published just this Thursday in the
 
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
Journal of addiction people who live in
 
00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
the US states that legalized
 
00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
recreational canus use uh they use Canal
 
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
up to 24% more frequently than those in
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
states where it's it remains illegal uh
 
00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
the study also included 111 pairs of
 
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:29.320 align:start position:0%
twins and they um compared the twins who
 
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
live in legalized States versus the ones
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
who did not live in states where it's
 
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
legal and there was up to 20% of the
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
twins living in the states where it was
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
legalized were using cannabis uh this
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
leads to well documented evidence-based
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
risk factors concerning substance use in
 
00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
teenagers this includes parental
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
substance use and and favorable or
 
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
permissive parental attitudes towards
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
cannbis and on the flip side uh
 
00:09:59.069 --> 00:09:59.079 align:start position:0%
protective factors for the Youth include
 
00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:01.519 align:start position:0%
parental disapproval and school
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
connectedness and I mention school
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
connectedness because we see this all
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
the time at the Children's Hospital
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis use is associated with poor
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
school performance um skipping classes
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
truy and low grades so we're often times
 
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:17.240 align:start position:0%
uh working with schools to address those
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
issues um a study published just last
 
00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:22.839 align:start position:0%
week in the Journal of jamama network
 
00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
open documented that some people with
 
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
pain anxiety or depression who obtain
 
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana cards overuse cannabis
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
and develop cannabis use disorder
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
failing to improve their symptoms um in
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
fact indeed 10% of them had developed a
 
00:10:43.629 --> 00:10:43.639 align:start position:0%
disorder in just 12 weeks of getting or
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
obtaining the card and those figures
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
Rose to 20% uh if they were using it for
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
things like depression or anxiety and
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
lastly uh even CBD I've talked a lot
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
about THC but CBD also or can cannabid
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
is another chemical made by the cannabis
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
plant uh which we feel like is you know
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
the good part of cannabis is how we put
 
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
it right but the thing is there's little
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
regulation of CBD products and Studies
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
have found that many products are
 
00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
mislabeled often containing less CBD
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
than uh they um than they label
 
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
themselves a recent study of 84 uh CBD
 
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
products purchased online found that
 
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
more than a quarter of the products
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
contain less CBD than labeled and THC
 
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
was found in 18 of them in high doses
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
even CBD can cause side effects such as
 
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
dry mouth diarrhea reduced appetite
 
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
drowsiness and fatigue and it can
 
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
interact with uh many medications
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
including blood thinners um perhaps most
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
concerningly the impact of CBD on the
 
00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
developing brain has not been studied
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
and we simply don't know the exposure uh
 
00:11:50.829 --> 00:11:50.839 align:start position:0%
that it has and and the impact it has on
 
00:11:52.829 --> 00:11:52.839 align:start position:0%
children there's a major concern because
 
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
we know that the canono system which is
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
sort of like the natural marijuana in
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
our brain is very active in in guiding
 
00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:01.399 align:start position:0%
brain growth and development throughout
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
childhood adolescence and even in young
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
adulthood while the risk of this
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
exposure May outweigh the benefits for
 
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
children with severe seizure disorders
 
00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
uh you know we prescribe them epidex
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
which is FDA approved uh but the risk
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
benefit ratio May well be quite
 
00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
different for children who don't have
 
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
these problems for these reasons I
 
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
recommend uh New Hampshire be cognition
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
of all these uh different impacts and
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
facts uh concerning cannabis while
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
making their decision on
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
future um legislature concerning um can
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:46.519 align:start position:0%
much thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
first of all Dr thank you very much for
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
coming um Dr we've heard uh when we we
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
legalize medical marijuana and we we say
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
that it could it could do something for
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
an individual that other medications
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
can't do kind of fill me in on on why
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
you think that's why that's the right
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
way or the wrong way to do it and and
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
why does it affect a person where other
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
medications keeps thank you so much for
 
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
that question so uh you know medical
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
marijuana is only so far approv for two
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
conditions one is severe intractable
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
seizures where no other medication works
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
and we're just trying to get these
 
00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:33.519 align:start position:0%
people just stabilized so it's sort of I
 
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
can say emergency situations and then
 
00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
the other situation where cannabis is
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
legalized is for people who are pretty
 
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
much have um a condition where they are
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
dying and they have pain and this is
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
something which could help them for
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
their pain uh while you know they're not
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
doing that well um so these are the only
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
two conditions where marijuana is
 
00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
medically um loated approved and these
 
00:14:03.749 --> 00:14:03.759 align:start position:0%
are FTA approved these medications such
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
as epidex right um the thing is once you
 
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
get away from these two conditions it's
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
very hard to see the benefits of
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
marijuana overall compared to the
 
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
potential side effects that it has and
 
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's why the medical community so far
 
00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:21.079 align:start position:0%
overall uh large for the large part has
 
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
been uh very cautious when uh
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
prescribing medications and and when you
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
prescribe medications for recreation use
 
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh whether it be at alcohol stores or
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
any other stores it gives people the
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
wrong impression and uh and we're seeing
 
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
the impact of that on the youth in
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts where where I work right
 
00:14:44.189 --> 00:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
now heard the question yeah thank you so
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
so if if all of this is present and if
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
scientific you know evidence that
 
00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:55.839 align:start position:0%
says the negative the negative effects
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
appear What what is the factor that is
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
pushing the the other way what what is
 
00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:04.279 align:start position:0%
the driving
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
force driving force for legalizing kind
 
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
of I mean this could be a matter of
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
opinion but I personally feel there's a
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
lot of uh Financial uh gains from this
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
which which which is what I see um and
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
and of course on on on the symptom side
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
of this a lot of patients do feel relief
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
when they use marijuana for anxiety and
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
depression however those it's sort of
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
like a Band-Aid it it it doesn't fix or
 
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
cure the problem it it you know you
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
you're intoxicated for a little while
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
you feel good for that particular period
 
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
of time and then it's over but the
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
underlying uh reasons you were using in
 
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
the first place like anxiety depression
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh they don't get better so that's why
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
we use other medications which are F
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
approved for such conditions and also
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
use therapy uh and there's various types
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
of therapy we use which have been shown
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
to benefit people with underlying
 
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
conditions such as anxiety and
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
depression and also unfortunately uh
 
00:16:05.069 --> 00:16:05.079 align:start position:0%
cannabis is very highly associated with
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
psychotic disorders so I'm seeing a lot
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
of kids teenagers like 19 20 year olds
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
who have who have first uh break
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
episodes of um psychosis and and a lot
 
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis follow up again so now in your
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
role as a practicing physician how many
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
kids do you see that that have been
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
involved with with barel water or using
 
00:16:34.749 --> 00:16:34.759 align:start position:0%
bar water quite
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
heavily you're seeing some of the
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
effects of this of the kids yeah so in
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
fact most of the kids I treat uh pretty
 
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
much use cannabis nicotine and cannabis
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
and even alcohol but especially nicotine
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
and cannabis are the most common uh
 
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
substances that kids are using actually
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
yep for sure more than 90% I would
 
00:16:58.829 --> 00:16:58.839 align:start position:0%
say it just let me Edward just we were
 
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
we were given a con job about
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and for years you know it was
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
makes you feel good uh take take away
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
your anxiety and so forth and so on and
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
what did we get out of that cancer lung
 
00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:14.110 align:start position:0%
what did we get out of that cancer lung
cancer

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
pervasive a number of other situations
 
00:17:20.429 --> 00:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
the body body parts fell apart we have a
 
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:23.720 align:start position:0%
settlement now with the tobacco industry
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
y uh and yet we're still
 
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
smoking problematic so you I'm glad you
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
brought that up actually uh Senator the
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
thing is that um just like you said so
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
for decades you know there's a lot of
 
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
financial gains you know cigarette
 
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
companies and were making a lot of money
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately it impacted Society in
 
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
a negative way for the most part and the
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
thing is that uh now those same
 
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
companies uh have I won't take any names
 
00:17:54.029 --> 00:17:54.039 align:start position:0%
but the same companies are not targeting
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
the youth because uh you know almost
 
00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
like they dos like why isn't up so now
 
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
there targeting the youth saying that
 
00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:03.799 align:start position:0%
things like marketing Vapes vape pens as
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
benign and not really containing
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
nicotine and not very dangerous for you
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's kind of cool thing to do uh it's
 
00:18:12.149 --> 00:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
just just water Vaped which is actually
 
00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
not the case at all because now it's so
 
00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:15.799 align:start position:0%
white spread it's an epidemic actually
 
00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
we're seeing kids as I mentioned earlier
 
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
with lung issues which we never saw
 
00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:23.559 align:start position:0%
before did this thing called evali or e
 
00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
cigarette and vaping Associated lung
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
injury it's a new thing I I believe it
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
was coined back in 2019 not too far back
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
and that's where we see kids with
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
shortess of breath decreased exercise
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
tolerance coughing uh you know and and
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
the thing is that um I have a feeling
 
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
that once Society wakes up you know
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
maybe another 10 years vaping might be
 
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
banned that's just my opinion but who
 
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
knows but that's where we are right now
 
00:18:51.149 --> 00:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
thank you than thank you sen so I have a
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
couple questions real quick so um
 
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
obviously the bill doesn't allow for
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
underage consumption right so 21 under
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
21 is illegal in the state in would be
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
illegal uh on the proposed bill so my
 
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
question comes is that early enough and
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
if not what's the what's the science
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
behind not doing it later than 21 if we
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
were to pick a different age and um Al
 
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
I'll startor with that I have a
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
follow-up question to that as well okay
 
00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:17.799 align:start position:0%
no thank you so much for that so the
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
thing is what is you know 21 or even 24
 
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
the thing is once you legalize uh you
 
00:19:26.909 --> 00:19:26.919 align:start position:0%
know substances like for example alcohol
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
has been legalized right and nicotine
 
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
right in the past so if you legalize
 
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
canvas you'll see the same impact that
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
the other substances have had on society
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
and the thing is that so most of the
 
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
kids that treat it's not like they're
 
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
getting marijuana through the doctors or
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
uh any such means they're getting it off
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
the streets and and and their main uh
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
logic is that Hey listen you know it's
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
legalized in Most states it's not a big
 
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
deal it's not like I'm doing cocaine or
 
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
or heroin so that's the way they
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
Justified and it just makes it e harder
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
and more more difficult for providers
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
such as myself and and many other
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
providers to provide treatment and we
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
have to sort of you know educate them on
 
00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:06.799 align:start position:0%
the brain and we call it like the
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
neurobiology sessions at at Children's
 
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
Hospital where we educate them on the
 
00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
brains and how substances affect them
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
and it takes time and a lot of these
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
kids do get better when they realize
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
what's going on but I feel like
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
legalization or even uh having it in the
 
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
market just for example like you you I
 
00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:24.200 align:start position:0%
walk down in Mass Massachusetts I walk
 
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
down some very nice towns and there are
 
00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:27.799 align:start position:0%
these nice stores like they look very
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
nice and have these vape pens in there
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
and cannabis and CBD and certain
 
00:20:33.789 --> 00:20:33.799 align:start position:0%
products which will help relax you in
 
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
fact I feel like going and getting one
 
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
myself it's just so nicely marketed so
 
00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:39.559 align:start position:0%
imagine kids right so that these are
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
just the concerns I have and and how do
 
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
we address this maybe like if it's if we
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
can have tests and done on these
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
products FDA takes a look at it
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
regulates them then maybe they can be
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
prescribed for certain conditions uh and
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
not just openly available in the market
 
00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:57.799 align:start position:0%
thank you let me just have one more
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
followup question so I I'm I'm assuming
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
you would support if a legalization
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
model is to go forward given the
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
conditions you've just outlined you
 
00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
would in support enhanced penalties for
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
the sale of marijuana to any kind of
 
00:21:13.149 --> 00:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
juvenile any kind of minor you would
 
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
support enhanced penalties against the
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
retailer or the whoever's providing
 
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
it yeah I mean the reason I don't want
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
to uh I mean that could be the case but
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
I I also am a little little cautious
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
about the penalty part because the thing
 
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
is I've also seen the flip side where
 
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
minorities and underprivileged
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
populations are using marijuana and then
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
they're going to jail for it and their
 
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
lives are destroyed so there could be a
 
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
better way for example Brown University
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
I know they have a they have a prison
 
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
system where they're treating uh PE
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
people instead of penalizing them so
 
00:21:49.269 --> 00:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
there could be many other alternatives
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
to that uh but but definitely we need
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
more uh we need more guidance in this
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
situation for sure so to be clear I'm
 
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
not talking about possession enhanced
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
penalty for possession for miners I'm
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
talking about enhanced penal for someone
 
00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:01.430 align:start position:0%
talking about enhanced penal for someone
who

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
provides to a to a
 
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
minor sure I mean yeah uh sure that
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
could maybe that that could work great
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you question
 
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
doctor yeah um thanks um so I my
 
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
question is is we're talking about age
 
00:22:22.029 --> 00:22:22.039 align:start position:0%
and we know that um children exposed to
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
marijuana sort of the earlier those that
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
are predisposed to things like
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
schizophrenia are you know that
 
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
increases the likelihood that they will
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
develop that mental illness do you have
 
00:22:32.669 --> 00:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
any sort of age parameters sort of
 
00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:34.039 align:start position:0%
capitalizing on what he was just saying
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of like exposure starting at
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
what what age it increases that risk and
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
by sort of what fold sure so the thing
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
is uh brand development actually uh
 
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
technically theoretically ends at age 25
 
00:22:50.029 --> 00:22:50.039 align:start position:0%
so there's a beautiful uh factor out
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
there if you don't use substances till
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
the age of 25 or 26 it's very rare for
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
you to have any substance use dis
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
shoulder afterwards so for so so if a
 
00:22:59.789 --> 00:22:59.799 align:start position:0%
person starts using substances at Agee
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
30 I'm not I'm not saying I'm not
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
encouraging that but if they do it's
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
very rare for them to actually have a
 
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
use disorder and and there are many
 
00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
factors which go into this so when
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
you're younger and you use substances
 
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
right the thing is a lot of these so
 
00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
it's easy when you're stressed out and
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
you know you're 19 or 20 you're stressed
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
out you you grab a joint and you smoke
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
it or vape it right the thing is that
 
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
you feel good you feel relaxed but the
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
underline causes problems are still
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
there right so the other caveat is that
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
you you don't develop cop skills so when
 
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
you when you stress out instead of
 
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
dealing with it and you know maybe using
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
strategies such as working out or
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
talking to your family or communicating
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
or whatnot uh you know these kids are
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
just picking up drugs and using them for
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
coping skills and then they don't learn
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
coping skills so it just becomes easier
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
for them to just have this as as as a as
 
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
a crutch and just keep using this in the
 
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
future so so so age 25 is when n
 
00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
development uh is pretty much complete
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
in most people
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
H up yeah so um I I just want to clarify
 
00:24:06.909 --> 00:24:06.919 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you you don't think that
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
raising the age to something like 25
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
which you know in theory if people were
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
using after that point would' put them
 
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
in a lot lower risk of a a a cannabis
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
use disorder would really change that
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
just based on the um sort of permissive
 
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
attitude shift or sort of cultural
 
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
change is that yeah so uh no the that's
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
a wonderful point you brought up so the
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
thing is that I think raing the age you
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
of course that's not the the as you said
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
that's not the solution but it may help
 
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
in the sense that at least people it's
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
different from 21 right so then people
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
might be thinking why is it 25 and it
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
would just make them think a little bit
 
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
more maybe like it would maybe make them
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
a little more cautious so maybe that
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
could be one good thing coming out of
 
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
it thank you anything
 
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.149 align:start position:0%
it thank you anything
else

00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
question um thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question question for
 
00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
your testimony uh very
 
00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
um comprehensive we appreciate that you
 
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned the ajama uh medical uh study
 
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
that where uh those the participants
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
developed uh cud cannabis use disorder
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
in 12 weeks uh can you tell me the age
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
range where those adolescents or adults
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
or a combination yeah so it was a um you
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
know I I think the age range was young
 
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
adult ads but there were yeah it was
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
mostly young adults if I'm not
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
mistaken yeah and that would be uh prior
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
to the age of
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
25 yes so we consider young adults till
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
age between 22 24 I would consider young
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
adults y okay that's great well while
 
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
the brain is still undergoing
 
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
development okay so that that makes them
 
00:25:51.789 --> 00:25:51.799 align:start position:0%
um you know when the brain is is um
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
undergoing rapid development uh it's
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
more vulnerable to addiction correct
 
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
yeah y okay and um followup question
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
okay uh followup uh at the outset you
 
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you treated 100 have been
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
you are treating or have been treating I
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
have been treating like at this yeah
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
they're on my panel and you said 90% of
 
00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
those uh are using uh cannabis uh like
 
00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
the 90% is just my own estimate but most
 
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:21.799 align:start position:0%
of them are using more often than not
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
yep okay and so would the majority of
 
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
those be under the age of 25 as well yes
 
00:26:30.029 --> 00:26:30.039 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you any other
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
questions for the doctor yes uh
 
00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.669 align:start position:0%
questions for the doctor yes uh
representative

00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:38.919 align:start position:0%
ol yeah thank you for your testimony
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
today doc appreciate it uh you're
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
talking about um addictive behavioral
 
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
disorders in
 
00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:50.039 align:start position:0%
general and age 25 seems to be a
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
commonly heard number I know refered at
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
County when we've been talking about
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
setting up uh treatment centers for uh
 
00:26:59.310 --> 00:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
various things and uh when we were
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
discussing the sexual orientation
 
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
there's something about your brain that
 
00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
kind of gets set at age 65 for uh
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
pedophilia if you
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
will the question
 
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
is addictive disorders are present and
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
yet we allow children to smoke
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
cigarettes we allow children to well
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
young adults to buy alcohol at
 
00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
21 so why don't we just raise everything
 
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
25 I agree in fact if it was up to me i'
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
I'd ban alcohol and and
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
nicotine great any other questions for
 
00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:40.519 align:start position:0%
the doctor so doctor I'm gonna just ask
 
00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
one more question again it's about what
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
would be in the bill proposed um what
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
would you add to a bill assuming again
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
legalization was going to happen what
 
00:27:51.789 --> 00:27:51.799 align:start position:0%
would you add to the bill to to help
 
00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
with the issue of substance disorder
 
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder or cannabis use
 
00:27:59.230 --> 00:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
disorder what would you add to the
 
00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:01.559 align:start position:0%
um I guess when when they're marketing
 
00:28:04.029 --> 00:28:04.039 align:start position:0%
it or selling it at least provide this
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
information uh somehow uh you know um on
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
the box maybe that you know BR is
 
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
developing until the age of 25 and um of
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
course make sure the kids don't get it
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
and then if we can have some something
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
in there where if adults are using they
 
00:28:23.549 --> 00:28:23.559 align:start position:0%
should make sure the kids it doesn't
 
00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
fall into kids' hands and if it does
 
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:27.799 align:start position:0%
there should be some sort of a
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
consequence for that I'm not sure what
 
00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559 align:start position:0%
that is but something some
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility thank
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
you we're El set thank you Doctor very
 
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:37.480 align:start position:0%
much and I'm gonna turn the gabble over
 
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
to Senator s thank you so much we on
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
Amy she's
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
Cliffe we have do have a copy of written
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
testimony so you don't have to recite it
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
and didn't just uh clarify you know the
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
together just to order the commission is
 
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
is but to put together a recreational
 
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
policy any any suggestions you have for
 
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
that assuming it that it one would
 
00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:16.909 align:start position:0%
that assuming it that it one would
become

00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:19.389 --> 00:29:19.399 align:start position:0%
law what what I'm what I'm you don't
 
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
have to read off the paper we're not
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
asking if someone supports recreational
 
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
campus or not but any advice on perhaps
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um I'll let you know who
 
00:29:45.389 --> 00:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
I am and then I would like to actually
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
drill down a little bit in the mental
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
health harms and I don't know I know
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
that um Dr Shaw touched on a little bit
 
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
the mental health harms but that is my
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
area of expertise and and I think it's
 
00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039 align:start position:0%
really important um that you fully
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
understand the Cannabis induced
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
psychosis conversion to psychotic
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
disorder and how devastating that is for
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
families and and I think this is clearly
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
outlined in the um prescribing insert of
 
00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:17.240 align:start position:0%
FDA approved um THC based medications
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
but doesn't get nearly enough attention
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
so if you're considering legalization
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
you're considering cannabis policy I
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
think what states have failed to do is
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
go back and look at that prescribing
 
00:30:30.669 --> 00:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
information and really look at what does
 
00:30:33.509 --> 00:30:33.519 align:start position:0%
that say all of the risks are clearly
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
outlined and the um amounts of THC that
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
are in the legal markets is astronomical
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
and what people are allowed to um to
 
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
possess and purchase are completely out
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
of line with what is in you know
 
00:30:51.789 --> 00:30:51.799 align:start position:0%
outlined for risks in the prescribing
 
00:30:51.799 --> 00:30:52.870 align:start position:0%
outlined for risks in the prescribing
information

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you for allowing me to speak
 
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
today my name is Amy turncliff I have a
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
PhD in neurobiology um from the
 
00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:01.799 align:start position:0%
University of North Carolina Chapel Hill
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
and did my post-doctoral training at
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
Harvard Medical School um my area of
 
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
expertise is mental health and substance
 
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
use disorders with a focus on cannabis
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
use and cannabis policy and the impact
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
on adolescent young adult Behavioral
 
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
Health and I've testified over the past
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
eight years in Massachusetts and I
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
cannot tell you how frustrated I and my
 
00:31:27.389 --> 00:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
colleague clinicians and scientists are
 
00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:28.919 align:start position:0%
and which is why we did put out a
 
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.120 align:start position:0%
statement of concern in in 2019
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
um because we really feel like a public
 
00:31:37.389 --> 00:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
health framework for legalization has
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
not happened has not happened in
 
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it has not happened in any
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
legal State um and then I think it's
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
important to say that my motivation for
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
being here is not strictly professional
 
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's personal I am a fourth generation
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
property holder in New Hampshire my kids
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
are the fifth generation to enjoy some
 
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
Su on beautiful Millan pond in
 
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
Washington and my family absolutely
 
00:32:03.149 --> 00:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
loves the White Mountains we also own a
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
home in Waterville Valley um so as I
 
00:32:10.269 --> 00:32:10.279 align:start position:0%
said I would like to you know I I would
 
00:32:12.909 --> 00:32:12.919 align:start position:0%
reiterate what Dr sha said about the
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
brain isn't fully developed until the
 
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
age of 25 or 30 and there's a whole host
 
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
of negative consequences that result
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
from adolescent um and young adult
 
00:32:22.559 --> 00:32:23.789 align:start position:0%
from adolescent um and young adult
cannabis

00:32:23.789 --> 00:32:23.799 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
00:32:27.389 --> 00:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
use with that being said adult the the L
 
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
shows that and and in from the very
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
beginning showed that adults do and can
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
experience cannabis induced psychosis
 
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
and about um 35 I think the literature
 
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
has shown and I think it's in my I will
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
say it in my testimony about 35 to 50%
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
of people who use um will experience and
 
00:32:49.629 --> 00:32:49.639 align:start position:0%
so to your point which is that while the
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
adolescents are if they experience
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis induced psychosis and they
 
00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:56.200 align:start position:0%
don't stop using and they continue to
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
experience psychosis symptoms their
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
brain is still developing they have a
 
00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
lot of neuroplasticity going on they're
 
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
probably more likely to convert to a
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
psychotic disorder literature shows
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
about 50% of those who experience
 
00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
cannabis and psychosis go on to uh
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
convert to a psychotic disorder if they
 
00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:16.519 align:start position:0%
don't stop using it's probably less
 
00:33:20.669 --> 00:33:20.679 align:start position:0%
likely that adults will transition to a
 
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
um a psychotic disorder that isn't then
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
reversed when they stop using um but a
 
00:33:31.629 --> 00:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
lot of people don't know that psychosis
 
00:33:34.509 --> 00:33:34.519 align:start position:0%
symptoms is a consequence of cannabis
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
use or T I should say THC when I say
 
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis really it's THC and that would
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
include like Delta a I know parents
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
whose kids have been put into cannabis
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
and do psychosis from using um some of
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
the derivatives including Delta 8 THC as
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to Delta 9
 
00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
so just one question is there any
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation or opinion you would have
 
00:33:57.149 --> 00:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
on on what a warning label would say say
 
00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
on a on a recreational product yeah so
 
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts I was a lead author on
 
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
some bills that we um had filed on our
 
00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
behalf to do just that so to warn about
 
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
um cannabis induced psychosis and and Su
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
suicidal thoughts and and um behaviors
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
and um anxiety um paranoia
 
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
hallucinations delusions you know that
 
00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
go along with psychosis in addition to
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
um cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome
 
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
which is not my area of expertise
 
00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
however because canis policy is an area
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
of expertise for me I am in several
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
groups um for canab of you know where um
 
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
patients and families are discussing
 
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
canab H hyperemesis syndrome and I I
 
00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:46.839 align:start position:0%
don't think again that most people
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
realize how devastating and
 
00:34:52.829 --> 00:34:52.839 align:start position:0%
life-threatening CHS is um it is
 
00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive with dozens and
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
dozens of visits to the Ed and
 
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
unnecessary surgeries and things like
 
00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:05.079 align:start position:0%
that um so there's a I could say a lot
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
about what a warning label should
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
include but my concern is if the warning
 
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
label's too long yes I'm not sure people
 
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
are going to everyone's going to read it
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so you wanted to be obviously you
 
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
listed number of concerns I feel like we
 
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
listed all those concerns on a warning
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
label I'm not saying they're not it's
 
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
not worthy being on there but the
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
average consumer I want to
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
keep it let me tell you that in
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
California because I work closely with
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
folks in California who are also trying
 
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
to put more Public Health focused policy
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
in place they have proposed um a
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
required something that would be like a
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
prescribing insert but not just for
 
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
medical products a required insert that
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
goes with products that clearly outlines
 
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
the risks and where individuals can find
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
help or what they should do if they
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
symptoms so like a war a a larger
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
warning label inside the meag it's a
 
00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
would be like an insert but what about
 
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
just the the label of the package which
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
is you know not not very large I most
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
it's half the size of my name tag I
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
think you're getting to the point which
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
are there are a lot of warnings there
 
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
are a lot of risks that people don't
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
know about so other ways to address that
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
are public awareness campaigns which I
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
don't particularly find all that
 
00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
effective um because it's just hard to
 
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
get the message out but because there
 
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
are so many risks there you could do
 
00:36:34.349 --> 00:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
something like tobacco where there's a
 
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
rotating warning and they have to change
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
the warning um every so often so that
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
all of the the warnings are seen by
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
consumers over a certain period of time
 
00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
so you know it's not so cluttered but it
 
00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:51.079 align:start position:0%
it's a real problem I mean it is but I'm
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you with your
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
expertise what would you prioritize or
 
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
on a warning label that's less than 50
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
words or less than 25 so I think you
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
have to prioritize that um if you're
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
pregnant or you know going to become
 
00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
pregnant so pregnant women should not be
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
using um cannabis products even though
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know we know from the literature
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
that dispensary workers tend to
 
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
recommend them to pregnant women um I
 
00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
would absolutely prioritize cannabis
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
into psychosis psychosis symptoms mental
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
health symptoms anxiety paranoia Etc if
 
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
you could perhaps maybe not at this
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
moment but maybe email the committee
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
commission a suggested warning label
 
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
that would be appreciated that can fit
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
on the package of a product it's going
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
to be very challenging like I said
 
00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
you're up for it though
 
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
um so I I as I mentioned I I would like
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
to just dial down into the Cannabis
 
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
induc psychosis for a second um and it
 
00:37:56.589 --> 00:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
is well accepted that THC can induce
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
acute psychotic symptoms that literature
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
comes from the clinical trials that
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
supported FDA approval of THC based
 
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
medications and um those were with
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
adults so um the association meets
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
Bradford Bradford Hill criteria for
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
causation which means that it's not just
 
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
those who were predisposed to develop a
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
psychotic disorder that will that
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily will uh develop the
 
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
psychotic disorder from cannabis induc
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
psychosis centuries of good quality data
 
00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
um much from the last decade show that
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
THC can induce acute episodes of
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
psychosis in a dose dependent Manner and
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
that the conversion rate from Cannabis
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
induced psychosis to schizophrenia or
 
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
bipolar disorder is higher than for any
 
00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
other drug induced psychosis at nearly
 
00:38:46.829 --> 00:38:46.839 align:start position:0%
50% in human laboratory studies
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
concerning healthy adults being
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
administered THC it has been
 
00:38:53.309 --> 00:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
approximated that 35 to 50% of those who
 
00:38:56.309 --> 00:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
will experience psychosis symptoms um go
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
on to develop uh Canabis psychotic
 
00:39:02.109 --> 00:39:02.119 align:start position:0%
disorder and I understand and I'm not
 
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
advocating that cannabis is healthy in
 
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
any capacity it's not the role of the
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
commission I just the commission is to
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
our role is to put together a
 
00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation on on a recreational
 
00:39:16.589 --> 00:39:16.599 align:start position:0%
policy on a control State Control model
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
which I I got I understand what you're
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
saying about that so I I guess we've
 
00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
heard testimony I understand that
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
there's a harmful potential harmful side
 
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
effects of a lot of things I guess how
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
would you recommend we incorporate your
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
the facts in your testimony and what
 
00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
you're saying and even with your written
 
00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
testimony into a recreational policy
 
00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.109 align:start position:0%
testimony into a recreational policy
that

00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:38.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
would mitigate those negative impacts I
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be completely honest with
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
you I don't think you can mitigate them
 
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
I think you need to prepare for how
 
00:39:49.309 --> 00:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to and my last bit of
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
testimon about who's going to be held
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
accountable for the increase in
 
00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
psychotic disorder who you know we have
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
Decades of experience and we talked a
 
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
little bit I heard about tobacco
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
industry so the tobacco industry
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
ultimately was held accountable for you
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
know through settlements and Etc and and
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
the outcome of that was a lot of change
 
00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
in tobacco policy as a consequence of
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
those lawsuits those of us um who are uh
 
00:40:21.069 --> 00:40:21.079 align:start position:0%
Public Health Advocates do believe that
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
there will be a reckoning down down the
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
road you heard Dr Shaw say you know
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
maybe a decade or more from now it's all
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
of this is going to come tumbling out
 
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
because there are a lot of parents whose
 
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
families are you know are really
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
irreversibly harmed by psychotic
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
disorder so you can put out public
 
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
awareness campaigns I mean we can list
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
off and I I did bring a copy of the
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
statement of concern and you may have
 
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
seen it already and there's a public
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
health framework that has been put
 
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
forward for uh legalizing um cannabis
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
and I would recommend if you want to
 
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
attempt to mitigate all of the harms
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
that will come with legalizing
 
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:07.240 align:start position:0%
commercializing I would strongly
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
recommend that you utilize a public
 
00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.470 align:start position:0%
recommend that you utilize a public
health

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
framework but I don't want to mislead
 
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
you and tell you that I think that is
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
going to mitigate the harms I I don't um
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
I do I think you might reduce them
 
00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:26.839 align:start position:0%
slightly maybe um but and we have
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
reduced tobacco use over time but that
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
there's a kind of a curve that happens
 
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
with that right you see this huge huge
 
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:37.640 align:start position:0%
amounts of harm with thousands and
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
thousands of people dying hundreds of
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
thousands of people dying as a result
 
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
the thing with cannabis is you don't see
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
that Stark death right it's it's not
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
lung cancer per se or that we've seen so
 
00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
far mental illness is is it creeps in
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
right and it it's it's hard to quantify
 
00:41:58.829 --> 00:41:58.839 align:start position:0%
the United States doesn't do a great job
 
00:41:58.839 --> 00:41:59.630 align:start position:0%
the United States doesn't do a great job
of

00:41:59.630 --> 00:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
quantifying um mental illness and
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
researchers are starting to do that but
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
but I don't want like I said I don't
 
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
want to mislead you and tell you that by
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
using a public health framework which
 
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
like I said I think you should use that
 
00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
you're it's going to be a Magic Bullet
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
because I'm certain it won't be and for
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of the reasons that Dr Shaw said
 
00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:25.839 align:start position:0%
which is a lot of what happens is around
 
00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
percept ction social uh social norms and
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
kind of Youth will gain access you can
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
put the age at 25 you could put the age
 
00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
of 30 young people are going to gain
 
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
access and and in Massachusetts surveys
 
00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
have been done and um and particularly
 
00:42:44.109 --> 00:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
in western Mass where a lot of our
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
dispensaries are concentrated and
 
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
they're showing that the majority of
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
young people are saying they're getting
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
their cannabis products and they are
 
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
using more product than they had been
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
before legalization they're getting the
 
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
majority of their product from legal s
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
legal dispensaries and those prod that's
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
not to say they're walking into
 
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
businesses and purchasing because
 
00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
they're not they're getting legal
 
00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:11.559 align:start position:0%
product through diverted sources so what
 
00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
we would might call like the gray market
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
so you know if you ask kids where are
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
they getting their um marijuana they'll
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
mostly say from friends or at a party so
 
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
it's social sources of access but now
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
they're accessing legal product through
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
social sources through an older sibling
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
through parents um they're paying some
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
you know like alcohol they're paying
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
someone to go get it for them so you can
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
work really hard and I'm not saying you
 
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't work really hard to reduce
 
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
youth use but you're going to see an
 
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
increase in youth use for all of the
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
said would you believe that in two years
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
of a medical marijuana dis dispensary
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
opening in our region we had saw a 88%
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
surge in youth
 
00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
use I would believe that would you also
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
believe that four toddlers were admitted
 
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
to our emergency room in THC induced
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
comr from from
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
Edibles the director of poison control
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
says sooner or later we're going to see
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
some deaths yeah so there was a um I
 
00:44:25.599 --> 00:44:26.950 align:start position:0%
some deaths yeah so there was a um I
just

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
coordinated a a group of clinicians and
 
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
researchers in Massachusetts to meet
 
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
with our joint committee our legislative
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
joint committee on cannabis policy in
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts just last week actually
 
00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
and they what the clinicians say is they
 
00:44:44.549 --> 00:44:44.559 align:start position:0%
would like to see uh medical marijuana
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
go by the wayside because it it sends a
 
00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:49.559 align:start position:0%
message to young people that it's safe
 
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
and healthy and so they believe and you
 
00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
know for the reasons that Dr Shaw said
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
um there are FDA approved THC based
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
medications our medical marijuana
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
program doesn't have follow any of the
 
00:45:10.829 --> 00:45:10.839 align:start position:0%
guidelines that are put forth in
 
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
prescribing inserts it doesn't have any
 
00:45:15.549 --> 00:45:15.559 align:start position:0%
of the warnings and if you look as I
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned if you the daily recom the
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
maximum recommended daily dose is 28
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
milligrams so you can barely find a
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
product in Massachusetts that would have
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
that would deliver that daily dose it's
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
Way Beyond and I I provided a onepage
 
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
information sheet that kind of breaks
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
down the math um and lists the the
 
00:45:53.069 --> 00:45:53.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:53.079 --> 00:45:54.870 align:start position:0%
 
medications

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
medications
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
as yeah very little if any so we don't
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
have um the same kinds of Grant programs
 
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
but I think California has a grant
 
00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
program where a certain percentage has
 
00:46:08.109 --> 00:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
to go back into prevention in
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts we don't have that um and
 
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
the the money goes back into the program
 
00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
so I know that Massachusetts would has
 
00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
been the Cannabis control Commissioners
 
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
have been tasked with putting out a
 
00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:25.559 align:start position:0%
public awareness campaign I can tell you
 
00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
they did not consult anyone in the
 
00:46:32.109 --> 00:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
prevention or Public Health Community on
 
00:46:35.309 --> 00:46:35.319 align:start position:0%
their campaign when they rolled it out
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
it it was I'm I'm going to be quite
 
00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
blunt it was kind of the laughing stock
 
00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
of um the prevention Community because
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
it it had a mom and and they put this on
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
billboards it had a mom and said
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis is legal in Massachusetts I
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
mean that was you know kind of the and
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
then it had a website go to this website
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
and it it really was was not based in
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
prevention science I I would encourage
 
00:47:03.549 --> 00:47:03.559 align:start position:0%
you strongly and I know you do have some
 
00:47:05.549 --> 00:47:05.559 align:start position:0%
prevention representation I would
 
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
encourage you strongly to utilize your
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
prevention professionals who know what
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
works in
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
prevention those of us who who do work
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
in prevention find it extremely
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
frustrating because we talk a lot about
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
wanting to reduce addiction but a lot of
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
our policies contribute to addiction so
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
you what percentage would
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
you as much as you could Poss possibly
 
00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.109 align:start position:0%
you as much as you could Poss possibly
manage

00:47:58.109 --> 00:47:58.119 align:start position:0%
manage
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
um do I think it's going to be enough to
 
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
offset the impact probably not um but I
 
00:48:09.309 --> 00:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
would again encourage and and that is
 
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
one of the pieces of a public health
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
framework for policy is to prioritize
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
prevention um but at the same time we
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
know that our best prevention strategies
 
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
are what are called environmental
 
00:48:26.829 --> 00:48:26.839 align:start position:0%
strategies and those really are our
 
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
policies and so when you take away our
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
our best really one of your best
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
prevention policies you have right now
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
is that you don't have legalized
 
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
recreational Cannabis when you take that
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
away you're going to take away one of
 
00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
factors when you talk about uh the
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
mental health issues that legalizing
 
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
marijuana brings up uh was Massachusetts
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
prepared do do they have enough
 
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
counselors or or or treatment
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
professionals to handle the S the surge
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
they don't no and it I mean if you will
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
allow I would like to read this quote
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
from she runs um AOS first episode
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
psychosis program in at Boston Medical
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
Center and she has provided testimony
 
00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
and I would like to read what she had to
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
say when she provided testimony to the
 
00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.630 align:start position:0%
say when she provided testimony to the
Massachusetts

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:31.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
legislature um she said and and again
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
she she's a clinical psychologist at
 
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
Boston Medical Center Boston University
 
00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
and Harvard Medical School she said I
 
00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
see many patients who have developed
 
00:49:44.829 --> 00:49:44.839 align:start position:0%
psychosis after using High potency THC
 
00:49:46.589 --> 00:49:46.599 align:start position:0%
products the average age that my
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
patients begin using THC is 15 and the
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
average age they develop psychosis is 21
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
earlier age of first use frequent use
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
and higher THC concent contrations are
 
00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:57.640 align:start position:0%
all well-known risk factors for
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
developing psychosis while some of my
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
patients are lucky in that they are able
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
to stop using THC and eventually recover
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
from their psychotic episode most are
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
not so lucky for some The psychosis does
 
00:50:11.549 --> 00:50:11.559 align:start position:0%
not go away even even though they stop
 
00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
using marijuana and that is the changes
 
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
in brain function are irreversible for
 
00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
others they are addicted to THC and
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
cannot abstain from using and thus
 
00:50:22.109 --> 00:50:22.119 align:start position:0%
cannot recover from their psychoses such
 
00:50:24.589 --> 00:50:24.599 align:start position:0%
histories are typical of a larger and
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
larger proportion of our schizophrenia
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
patients a growing body of research
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
demonstrates that these individuals are
 
00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
not necessarily people who would have
 
00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
developed schizophrenia without using
 
00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
marijuana she goes on to say I love my
 
00:50:38.589 --> 00:50:38.599 align:start position:0%
job but I hope you never need to bring
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
anyone in your family to my clinic
 
00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
because they have developed
 
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
schizophrenia so absolutely not and and
 
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
I in this meeting last week I she
 
00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned that she doesn't think people
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
even know that this is a symptom and so
 
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
that psychosis is a symptom so when they
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
experience psych psychosis symptoms they
 
00:50:57.870 --> 00:50:57.880 align:start position:0%
tend to use more because they think it
 
00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:00.839 align:start position:0%
helps their symptoms but in reality
 
00:51:00.839 --> 00:51:11.270 align:start position:0%
helps their symptoms but in reality
they're

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
worsening I realized I'm just a stand in
 
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
this morning but thank you doctor for
 
00:51:17.549 --> 00:51:17.559 align:start position:0%
being here and offering your testimony
 
00:51:19.789 --> 00:51:19.799 align:start position:0%
um do you see any kind of association
 
00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:21.640 align:start position:0%
between the mental health issues that
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
you're talking about right now and
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
mental health issues that seem to be
 
00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
plaguing our country in
 
00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
general so there hasn't been a
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
great kind of study so far of the
 
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
contribution of you know substance use
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
to the Adolescent mental health issues
 
00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
certainly mental health issues occur in
 
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
adolescence for a variety of reasons and
 
00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
substance use and cannabis use in
 
00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
particular isn't the only you know cause
 
00:51:56.589 --> 00:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
um though I will say and I and I I again
 
00:51:58.510 --> 00:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
put that in here that there was a Wall
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
Street Journal headline that was legal
 
00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
weed feeds the Teen Mental Health crisis
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
and I I will say that clinicians and
 
00:52:09.309 --> 00:52:09.319 align:start position:0%
scientists do believe that it that is
 
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:13.640 align:start position:0%
true and so I think as I mentioned um we
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
do believe that there is a a worsening
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
and if you dial down and look at data
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
those that um have sub uh mental health
 
00:52:25.589 --> 00:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
issues they do use substance is at
 
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
higher rates and it's hard to know right
 
00:52:28.349 --> 00:52:28.359 align:start position:0%
people say well why are they
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
self-medicating what's coming first and
 
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
the the testimony I just read to you
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
from this um clinician she said her date
 
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
she is data to support the idea that in
 
00:52:43.789 --> 00:52:43.799 align:start position:0%
many cases this the cannabis use is
 
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
coming first before the mental health
 
00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
health issues in particular um the first
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
issues I I I think I it's I don't think
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's disputed that cannabis can be
 
00:52:58.789 --> 00:52:58.799 align:start position:0%
harmful to to Children
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
particularly uh I guess any
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation on what a state like New
 
00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should do when we're
 
00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
surrounded now just say my district
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
district 22 I'm four towns I'm
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
surrounded by five dispensaries and I'm
 
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
fairly confident if Lawrence didn't have
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
such a high crime rate it would be if
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
the spency there so I I'm surrounded by
 
00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:19.720 align:start position:0%
these stores so I'm I feel like where I
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
live all these harmful effects that
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
you're talking about it's already there
 
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
so so I guess my my question is what's
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
your recommendation to to New Hampshire
 
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
because we have the same I'm sure some
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
of the Border communities along the main
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
border can bring up the same issue and
 
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure about Vermont yet but I
 
00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
feel like that's coming so so for us we
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
can do nothing yeah and keep it illegal
 
00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
I get that and we we still have to deal
 
00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:45.319 align:start position:0%
with the crossb issues so any
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation you have to St how to
 
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:49.720 align:start position:0%
deal with that so I want to touch on one
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
more piece of data that addresses what
 
00:53:53.549 --> 00:53:53.559 align:start position:0%
you just said which is Western
 
00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:55.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts as I mentioned is kind
 
00:53:58.270 --> 00:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
kind of a hot spot for dispensaries and
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
so there are some communities that have
 
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
no cap on dispensaries and it's kind of
 
00:54:04.789 --> 00:54:04.799 align:start position:0%
they call themselves kind of the wild
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
west of um of
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
commercialization and so they have um
 
00:54:14.109 --> 00:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
they're they have kind of a county based
 
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
prevention system and so they they
 
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:19.480 align:start position:0%
survey kids across an entire County so
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
they have many communities in their in
 
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
their catchment and they have found that
 
00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
the those communities that have and you
 
00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
just mentioned five dispensaries that
 
00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
have more that have dispensaries and
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
more dispensaries have more youth use
 
00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
and more use related harm so again I'm
 
00:54:39.069 --> 00:54:39.079 align:start position:0%
just going to say you actually in your
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
community if you don't have dispensaries
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
that is a protective factor for the kids
 
00:54:45.789 --> 00:54:45.799 align:start position:0%
in your community well let me rephrase
 
00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
this there's one in Tings Boro there's
 
00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
one in drit and there's three in hav
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
okay okay that's and my community pelum
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
Salem ACC cled out mhm that just wraps
 
00:54:58.710 --> 00:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
around us like a like a glove so I'm
 
00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
asking what would you recommend someone
 
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
in that situation because it as far as
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned there's one of them if you
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
go in the parking lot you can see the
 
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
welcome New Hampshire sign yeah it's
 
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
true the one in hav so yeah what's your
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation on on an issue like
 
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
that I you know what I'm going to say
 
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
which is don't have any dispensaries in
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
your own Community you you might think
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
that that's not your kids in your
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
community in New Hampshire are seeing
 
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
what those those dispensaries they might
 
00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
be accessing product from those
 
00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
dispensaries if that's what you think I
 
00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
would say do some data collection if you
 
00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
are not sure what's what is the the
 
00:55:38.829 --> 00:55:38.839 align:start position:0%
results of that but and yes if they're
 
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
seeing Billboards in Massachusetts we've
 
00:55:42.829 --> 00:55:42.839 align:start position:0%
got a terrible problem with Billboards
 
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
the industry has been left to
 
00:55:47.549 --> 00:55:47.559 align:start position:0%
self-regulate and so we have egregious
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
Billboards like cannabis for everyone
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
life is better with cannabis absolutely
 
00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
no advertising to young people is a a
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
pillar of a public health framework um
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
but I would still say that the majority
 
00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
of communities in Colorado opted out of
 
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
recreational Cannabis retail stores so
 
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
while there are in in Massachusetts we
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
have dozens and dozens and dozens of
 
00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
communities including my own that don't
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
have retail stores so what I would say
 
00:56:20.589 --> 00:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
is those
 
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
communities what the data has shown is
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
the communities that don't have retail
 
00:56:27.069 --> 00:56:27.079 align:start position:0%
stores that is a protective factor for
 
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
their kids you're sending a message to
 
00:56:32.349 --> 00:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
your young people we don't think we we
 
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
prioritize your health and safety and so
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have these stores in
 
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
our community and so the data has shown
 
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:42.200 align:start position:0%
that that is a protective factor for
 
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
you um thank you um the Surgeon General
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
in 2019 stated that no amount of
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
marijuana used an adolescence is known
 
00:56:57.069 --> 00:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
safe would that something like that on a
 
00:57:04.829 --> 00:57:04.839 align:start position:0%
label um no am no amount of uh cannabis
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
use is safe for
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
adolescence be be something that you
 
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:13.880 align:start position:0%
would recommend
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
sure um I but I'm gonna say that young
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
people are not typically using packaged
 
00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
product they're using product that has
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
maybe been sold
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
and then is you know you know purchased
 
00:57:30.589 --> 00:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
by an adult and then either repackaged
 
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
or opened and here's you know you're
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
going to pay me this amount of money for
 
00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
this you're going to pay me this for
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
this so
 
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
so maybe that that's helpful for parents
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
so that they're not providing product in
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
in you know to their kids um but with
 
00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
that being said Massachusetts does have
 
00:57:56.349 --> 00:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
labeling that says not not safe for for
 
00:57:59.029 --> 00:57:59.039 align:start position:0%
anyone under 21 or not not for for use
 
00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:00.440 align:start position:0%
Keep Out Of Reach of children things
 
00:58:02.829 --> 00:58:02.839 align:start position:0%
like that uh the Surgeon General also
 
00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
recommend recommended um THC caps at 5
 
00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:07.710 align:start position:0%
recommend recommended um THC caps at 5
to

00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:07.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
10% um yeah and and yet we're seeing
 
00:58:17.029 --> 00:58:17.039 align:start position:0%
sales at 99% yeah yes so I would again I
 
00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
can I would happy to send the the public
 
00:58:23.069 --> 00:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
health framework the list of policies a
 
00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:27.400 align:start position:0%
THC cap and um products taking removing
 
00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
or not having products that are
 
00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
appealing to children so the candies the
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
cookies the gummies anything with sugar
 
00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
California just tried to do that um
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
Colorado has tried to do that
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts trying to do that those of
 
00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
us who are public health Advocates um
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
are really trying to do that and 10% THC
 
00:58:47.069 --> 00:58:47.079 align:start position:0%
but I will say the naida defined dose
 
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
unit is 5 milligrams so I would caution
 
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
you on the percentage piece because
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
you've got you've got concent
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
flow um Edibles and so in Massachusetts
 
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:01.640 align:start position:0%
even some of our commissioners thinks we
 
00:59:05.789 --> 00:59:05.799 align:start position:0%
have a cap we don't really have a cap um
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
on concentrate because the percentage
 
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
ranges so so broadly right you can have
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
50% or you can have 100% THC but you're
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to possess five grams so you
 
00:59:22.829 --> 00:59:22.839 align:start position:0%
either have you know there you know we
 
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
do have to we have another witness
 
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's to testify and the original goal
 
00:59:29.069 --> 00:59:29.079 align:start position:0%
of today's meeting is to start going
 
00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
through the working draft so we can at
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
least kind of see what what we have on
 
00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
paper and compare and compare the notes
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
on that as a commission so we do got to
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
keep I do assure that the Massachusetts
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
model is not something that I would
 
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
support and I and it is nothing close to
 
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
the policy that we're this commission is
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
looking into so Mr chair I do have one
 
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
one more question for our witness uh at
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
the outset you mentioned that uh the
 
00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:57.640 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Community U drafted a
 
01:00:00.829 --> 01:00:00.839 align:start position:0%
statement of concern is that could we
 
01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
access that would you be able to send
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
that to our I I actually have a copy
 
01:00:06.349 --> 01:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not a formal copy it's
 
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
just a printed copy but it's um a copy
 
01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:12.680 align:start position:0%
nonetheless we can have if you want you
 
01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
can hand it daily we can get some copies
 
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
made for the commission
 
01:00:20.109 --> 01:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
okay is Scott
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
gagen thank you very much thank you
 
01:00:23.559 --> 01:00:27.870 align:start position:0%
gagen thank you very much thank you
excellent

01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
and I know you've heard this already but
 
01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:32.680 align:start position:0%
again we're just asking for
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations yeah I get it on not
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
that I'm not asking whether you support
 
01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:38.799 align:start position:0%
any type of recreational policy but if
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
one were to happen y any advice on how
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
to implement that in to totally
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
understand the question and actually um
 
01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:46.119 align:start position:0%
I'm a good person to speak to this
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
question because I was in this position
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
in Maine so first let me introduce
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
myself I'm Scott gor um I'm a certified
 
01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
prevention specialist I've been in the
 
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
prevention field for 18 years I've been
 
01:00:57.309 --> 01:00:57.319 align:start position:0%
involved in cannabis policy and politics
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
in Maine for over 10 years um and in
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
fact I was actually part of the I led
 
01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
the Coalition that opposed the
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
legalization initiative in Maine um in
 
01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
2016 it was a coalition of Public Health
 
01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health healthc Care
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
Professionals um really broad Coalition
 
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
of folks that came out opposed that and
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
if you followed the election in Maine
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
you know it was very close um three
 
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
actually I know the exact number 3,997
 
01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
votes between yes and no it was very
 
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
close um because of that I was afforded
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to join a sort of a
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
bipartisan if you will Coalition of
 
01:01:34.349 --> 01:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
folks to come to the table to make
 
01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations because it didn't early
 
01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
pass it was going to go forward so you
 
01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
had folks like me from the Public Health
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
Community you had folks from the
 
01:01:43.029 --> 01:01:43.039 align:start position:0%
industry had folks from faith-based uh
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
Corners that were opposed to it um and
 
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
we did make some recommendations and I'm
 
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
happy to go through some of the
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
recommendations I would have I do want
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
to preface that though my experience in
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
Maine is a lot of that work
 
01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately was unraveled by A
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
legislature that does not take cannabis
 
01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
seriously and so that would be my
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
warning is I can give you a whole list
 
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
of recommendations and I will I'll walk
 
01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:07.720 align:start position:0%
I'll walk through things you should put
 
01:02:10.829 --> 01:02:10.839 align:start position:0%
in your bill but if your legislature and
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know New Hampshire legislature
 
01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:14.039 align:start position:0%
I'm just speaking of my experience in
 
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
Maine is there's not enough legislators
 
01:02:18.789 --> 01:02:18.799 align:start position:0%
that take all the outcomes in the risks
 
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
that were just spoken about seriously a
 
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
good example of that is in Maine we have
 
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
two industries we have a medical
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
industry and adult use use industry the
 
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
adult use use industry requires testing
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
track and Trace all that good stuff our
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
medical industry does not so we call
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
marijuana medicine in main but we don't
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
require testing of it we don't require
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
track and Trace and it's because the
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
legislators don't have the courage to
 
01:02:44.589 --> 01:02:44.599 align:start position:0%
come forward and do what they know needs
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
to be done everyone knows it's
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
ridiculous that something that's called
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
the medicine is not being tested for
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
just Metals just
 
01:02:56.109 --> 01:02:56.119 align:start position:0%
contaminants because legislators won't
 
01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
won't won't have the courage to stand up
 
01:02:58.990 --> 01:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
that so again I'm going to walk through
 
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
what I would recommend you do but an
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
important piece of this would be you can
 
01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
put forward the
 
01:03:07.269 --> 01:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
best legislation that's ever happened in
 
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
this country when it comes to Canvas
 
01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
legalization but if your legislature
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't take it seriously and either
 
01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:15.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass it or Waters it down or
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
passes it and Waters it down in the next
 
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:19.559 align:start position:0%
session I'm just putting the I'm just
 
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
kind of raising the the warnings that
 
01:03:23.789 --> 01:03:23.799 align:start position:0%
you can put the best thing forward but
 
01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:25.720 align:start position:0%
the work after it is going to be just as
 
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
important to protect what you put in
 
01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
there but again as as Dr turnl said I do
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
I do have to be honest I think if you
 
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
come up with the best thing that's ever
 
01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:35.960 align:start position:0%
been done in the country I don't think
 
01:03:38.109 --> 01:03:38.119 align:start position:0%
you're going to mitigate all the risks
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
and and the harms um so I would just say
 
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
that but what would I so things you
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
should shouldn't do that main is done um
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
to their credit the main office of
 
01:03:50.029 --> 01:03:50.039 align:start position:0%
cannabis policy who is the regulator in
 
01:03:52.589 --> 01:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
our state has in their mission statement
 
01:03:54.269 --> 01:03:54.279 align:start position:0%
that they value public health and they
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
want to protect Public Health
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
Unfortunately they have not walked the
 
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:02.200 align:start position:0%
walk um we have a uh in Maine we had a
 
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh cannabis advisory commission which I
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
was a member of uh representing Public
 
01:04:10.109 --> 01:04:10.119 align:start position:0%
Health um so the the office of cannabis
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
poliy wasn't really a great supporter of
 
01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
that and uh through uh working with
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
legislators that's basically been kill
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
killed off so it doesn't exist anymore
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
so that's one Avenue that public health
 
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
the one Avenue Public Health has had to
 
01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
have any kind of oversight on regulation
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
as main was was was done away with the
 
01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
other thing that happened to me there
 
01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
was a question earlier about uh funding
 
01:04:33.309 --> 01:04:33.319 align:start position:0%
and funding going to prevention now
 
01:04:34.589 --> 01:04:34.599 align:start position:0%
again to our credit and this was
 
01:04:37.269 --> 01:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
something I advocated for personally was
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
a public health and safety fund so 12%
 
01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
of uh tax revenues go into this public
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
health and safety fund the original
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
incarnation of that is it was to be
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
split between law enforcement and um
 
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
prevention so the the portion for law
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement was for training and the
 
01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:55.640 align:start position:0%
portion for vention was for you know Ed
 
01:04:59.390 --> 01:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
health education and etc etc um when I
 
01:05:01.069 --> 01:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
when I advocated for that the intention
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
of that is the the the the public health
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
money would go to an entity in state
 
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
government that actually knew something
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
about public health but instead it's
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
with the office of cannabis policy which
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
know they're great they're fine people
 
01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
but they do not have public health
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
expertise so the only thing that they
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
funded so far that remotely close to
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
prevention as a PSA Campaign which as we
 
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
shared is really low when it comes to
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
prevention really is not effective I I'm
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
not saying you you shouldn't do PSAs and
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
and campaigns they the science is pretty
 
01:05:33.269 --> 01:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
clear they don't move the needle when it
 
01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
comes to prevention preventing addiction
 
01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:37.480 align:start position:0%
um young people young adults are across
 
01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
the lifespan and so we've advocated over
 
01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
and over and over again that for the
 
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
office of canus policy to work with main
 
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
CDC the actual Public Health experts to
 
01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
work with them to get that money into
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
prevention coalitions and to get it on
 
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:50.839 align:start position:0%
the ground in the communities to do the
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
work and they won't do it they won't do
 
01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:55.839 align:start position:0%
it uh um which is very very frustrating
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
so don't do that if you are going to put
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
money into public health and prevention
 
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
make sure it goes to where it can
 
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
actually be used in a useful way to the
 
01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
to to part of state government or an
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
entity that actually has background and
 
01:06:10.589 --> 01:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
understanding of Public Health uh
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
science um so I mean we've discussed
 
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
potency I mean I think you know Most
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
states have not done potency caps I
 
01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
would highly encourage looking at uh
 
01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
potency caps and as as was discussed the
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
trick with that though is is you know
 
01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
10% again does seem to be sort of the
 
01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
cut off and in a lot of States you're
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
really hard pressed to find Cannabis
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
products of that potency or or lower so
 
01:06:36.029 --> 01:06:36.039 align:start position:0%
I mean addressing the potency is going
 
01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:39.640 align:start position:0%
to be an important uh important piece
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
you know another other things that have
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
happened in Maine is originally in our
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
original legislation we did not allow
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
for delivery sales we did not allow for
 
01:06:48.029 --> 01:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
vending sales we did not allow for
 
01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
drive-through sales but that is slowly
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
starting to be watered down so we've
 
01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
just we've just allowed delivery sales
 
01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:57.640 align:start position:0%
but we we've also the kicker with that
 
01:06:58.990 --> 01:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
is we've allowed we're also allowing
 
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
delivery sales to municipalities that
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
have opted out or have not opted in to
 
01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
sales so most communities in Maine have
 
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
not opted in to allowing dispensaries
 
01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
but because of this delivery bill that's
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
passed now deliveries can go anywhere in
 
01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
main whether or not they've opted in and
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
so that's become kind of a way for the
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
industry due to an end round of of the
 
01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
the wishes of towns in our state um so
 
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
that's been an issue um the the public
 
01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:29.839 align:start position:0%
health warnings on on packages um
 
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:30.839 align:start position:0%
something that I've been really
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
frustrated with in Maine is uh you know
 
01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
to our again to our credit we did there
 
01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
is a requirement for health and safety
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
warnings uh but unfortunately when the
 
01:07:41.269 --> 01:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
when they do the rules and regulations
 
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
for they said the minimum font for that
 
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
is six points so basically these health
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
and safety warnings are required on all
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
adult use packages or hiding in plain
 
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
sight no one ever sees them in fact when
 
01:07:52.829 --> 01:07:52.839 align:start position:0%
I do presentations and and and what know
 
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
I do this little little gimmicky thing
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
where I hand out things in six point
 
01:07:59.670 --> 01:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
fonts and to demonstrate how ridiculous
 
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
uh uh that is so I think that's
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
important but really again I I can't
 
01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:05.480 align:start position:0%
stress enough I think if I can just
 
01:08:07.309 --> 01:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
interrupt you do you know the font on
 
01:08:09.789 --> 01:08:09.799 align:start position:0%
the side of a pack of cigarettes what's
 
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
that on the surgeon general's warning on
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
on a pack of cigarettes what's the font
 
01:08:15.269 --> 01:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
size I honestly don't know off the top
 
01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
of mayad I I feel like it's bigger than
 
01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
6.5 the audience know anyone you have to
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
just it's got five six here's a package
 
01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
I was going forgot get the no we we
 
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
don't have to hand the package I'm just
 
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
I'm asking he sent a font size I'm just
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
trying to hly don't I don't know for
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
forget the question I don't know to talk
 
01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:35.480 align:start position:0%
it's probably a0 eight I would say I but
 
01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
I just think it's ineffective right I
 
01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
mean it's a good policy I mean it's good
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
that it's required I just think you know
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
the again when the the rules were
 
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
written it's they're written in such a
 
01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:46.759 align:start position:0%
way that they can be hiding in in plain
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
sight but again I I can't stress enough
 
01:08:51.149 --> 01:08:51.159 align:start position:0%
I think the important here is again I
 
01:08:52.749 --> 01:08:52.759 align:start position:0%
can I can and I can email you a lot of
 
01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
other recommend
 
01:08:57.709 --> 01:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
but if again if you have a legislature
 
01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
or if you have efforts to water that
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
down or to not take this seriously
 
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
because that is really the biggest to me
 
01:09:06.669 --> 01:09:06.679 align:start position:0%
that's the biggest risk to our young
 
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
people when it comes to cannabis we
 
01:09:09.789 --> 01:09:09.799 align:start position:0%
don't have enough adults taking it
 
01:09:10.749 --> 01:09:10.759 align:start position:0%
seriously whether it's in the
 
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
legislature whether it's parents and and
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh other trusted adults whether it's
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
school officials what it's it's there's
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
this lacad isical attitude towards it
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
like it's not as bad as a bunch of other
 
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
things when it been perfectly laid out
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
why it is and even until our adults and
 
01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
our legislators and what our Governors
 
01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:32.679 align:start position:0%
take this seriously and and Dem and
 
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
convey that message not just through
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
what they say but through the policies
 
01:09:37.950 --> 01:09:37.960 align:start position:0%
and to stand behind them and to make
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
sure that they endure um we're we're
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
just going to be we're just going to be
 
01:09:46.110 --> 01:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
chasing our tals if you will so so I
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
would just again encourage you know at
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
the outset to have good Public Health
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
experts weigh in on this and have a seat
 
01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
at the the table not just one but like
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
many you know do listening sessions go
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
around the state get get input from
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
everyone um in the Public Health
 
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
Community and and and not tokenism
 
01:10:06.149 --> 01:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
because that's I've seen that too often
 
01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
in states where if there is public
 
01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
health input it's tokenism it's one
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
person at its seat that's again I go
 
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
back to the Cannabis advisory commission
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
I was the only person uh the only Public
 
01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
Health seat and I had to fight to get
 
01:10:20.189 --> 01:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
that seat and then they just did away
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
with the commission so again this needs
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
to be meaningful not to ISM input um
 
01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
from public health but then go into it
 
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
with eyes open to know that the best
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
thing that you put out still probably
 
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
won't be enough it's I mean you should
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
still do it but
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
um and I can't stress enough funding
 
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
prevention and not just PSAs I think
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
funding your prevention coalitions
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
because they're going to have more work
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
to do when you legal if and when if or
 
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
when you legalize this they will have
 
01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
more work to do in Sama the federal
 
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
government is not going to give them
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
more money because they can't they can't
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
fund coalitions to uh to do work with
 
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
legalized uh cannabis so they they're
 
01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
going to have more work to do so they're
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
going to need more support uh from the
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
state whether or not they opt in because
 
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
even though they don't opt in there's
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
still people going to be buying and
 
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
getting access to it so I think
 
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
investing in your prevention Coalition
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
because they know what to do they have
 
01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
the science they know what to do in
 
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
their communities to uh to protect
 
01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.310 align:start position:0%
their communities to uh to protect
them

01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
um so it's I mean I'll I'll take
 
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
questions and and um but again my my
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
colleagues before me really laid out all
 
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
the science I don't really need to go
 
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
into again because my frustration in
 
01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
main again is just it's been the lack of
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
seriousness that this the issue has been
 
01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
taken and it's it's it's impacting young
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
people I mean I've I could tell you all
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
kind of anecdotes of families that have
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
been impacted by this going to the
 
01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
emergency room uh getting suspended or
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
expelled out of school um we just we
 
01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
need we need adults to step up and uh
 
01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
take it seriously now and in per perpet
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
is good morning thanks for your
 
01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
testimony sure I I just a quick question
 
01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
I I didn't quite understand you said the
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
money is there in Maine to to do the
 
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
prevention but they're afraid to use it
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
well I it's it's not be in my in my
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
opinion it's not being used properly
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh so and and I should uh so the
 
01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
original uh the original version of the
 
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
public health and safety fund is 12% 6%
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
went to Law Enforcement Training 6% they
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
since have changed that language so now
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's no longer that 50/50 split so it's
 
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
a little looser so it doesn't half of it
 
01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to go to to prevention so
 
01:12:43.629 --> 01:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
that was one change that that that made
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
a little worse but then even the amount
 
01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
money that is for the public health
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
prevention pieces it's with the office
 
01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
of cannabis policy and they don't have
 
01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
any public health experts on on staff
 
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
where it should have gone where I was
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
advocating for it to go to was to main
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
CDC it should have gone to main CDC
 
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
because they can get that money to the
 
01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
prevention coalitions and M to do that
 
01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
work instead the only thing that they've
 
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
done is funded uh some PSA campaigns
 
01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
which really just science is pretty
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
straightforward that that has minimal if
 
01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
any impact when it comes to preventing
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
addiction so I think if if just made
 
01:13:18.669 --> 01:13:18.679 align:start position:0%
that change of if lawmakers or someone
 
01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
would come forward the bill and says go
 
01:13:23.629 --> 01:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
back to the 6% it has to go like I don't
 
01:13:26.350 --> 01:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
know 85% of it goes to prevention
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
communities like at a minimum I think
 
01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
that would be a significant change
 
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
that's something I've been advocating
 
01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
for but so far uh it hasn't really gone
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
anywhere so I I hav even got an answer
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
to why they won't fund prevention they
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
me um thank you Scott for your testimony
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
um preven were and I I led you for
 
01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
leading that Coalition you know that
 
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's really a near miss so you almost
 
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
got there so but that's a lot I didn't
 
01:14:05.709 --> 01:14:05.719 align:start position:0%
get a lot of sleep in that couple of
 
01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
years I'll say you yeah you push the
 
01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
grer because of it but the the issue is
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
is we can't keep pushing up the boulder
 
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
up hill prevention with the policy
 
01:14:16.830 --> 01:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
makers pushing back down on the Boulder
 
01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly what this process is
 
01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
designed to do even unintentionally
 
01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
that's what's going to happen
 
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
preventions is designed to prevent the
 
01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:31.400 align:start position:0%
problem from starting in the first place
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
and we do that by building protective
 
01:14:36.669 --> 01:14:36.679 align:start position:0%
factors and mitigating risk factors this
 
01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
is as I think Dr turncliff said one of
 
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
the the biggest um risk factors that we
 
01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
could even be discussing in in a state
 
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
during a mental health and an addiction
 
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
crisis so I I can I speak to that just
 
01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
for a minute so I I I just want to plug
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
that um samsa so that's the federal
 
01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
funer of substance Services had did come
 
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
out about two years ago with an
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
evidence-based resource guide for
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
preventing youth marijuana use 18 and
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
under and one of the sections in there
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
they lay out the these specific risk and
 
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
protective factors for young people when
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
it comes to cannabis and what you just
 
01:15:15.229 --> 01:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
said is in the sort of there's and
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
there's different layers to this so they
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
have individual risk factors uh family
 
01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
risk factors School risk factors and
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
then like Community risk factors when
 
01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
you look at the the list of community
 
01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
risk factors it's basically actually I
 
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
have it on
 
01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
my piece of paper here I can read off so
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
the the community level risk factors for
 
01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
youth cannabis use are widespread
 
01:15:35.669 --> 01:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
availability of cannabis greater
 
01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:37.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis Outlet density more days and
 
01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
hours of cannabis sales exposure to
 
01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis marketing youth exposure to
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis marketing on social media and
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
products such as candy Edibles that are
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
attractive to use so just the very
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
existence and I I hate to to harp on
 
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
this but just the very existence of a
 
01:15:54.990 --> 01:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis Market will be a risk factor
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you again um so again um we'
 
01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
we've heard from our three speakers I'm
 
01:16:29.629 --> 01:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
going to open up briefly for any public
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
comment based on the three speakers that
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
might want input because then our next
 
01:16:34.110 --> 01:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
step is to start walking through the
 
01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
bill and talking about sections in the
 
01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
bill so is there anybody from the public
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
who would like to speak and come up come
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
on up to the microphone sir and just
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
make sure you state your name clearly so
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
we can get a document great you want to
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:52.080 --> 01:17:01.870 align:start position:0%
 
around

01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
St your name of the record and go ahead
 
01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is Jim Riddle of
 
01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro I'm a USDA licensed hemp
 
01:17:12.669 --> 01:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
grower and I'm offering my comments
 
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
today on my own
 
01:17:17.229 --> 01:17:17.239 align:start position:0%
behalf um earlier this year and and my
 
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
comments are directly related to the
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
charge of this
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
commission um earlier this year I
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
testified several times in support of HB
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
639 and when I did since I'm a farmer I
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
was asked how many farmers in New
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire interested in becoming
 
01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:33.510 align:start position:0%
Hampshire interested in becoming
cannabis

01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
Growers and I didn't know that answer so
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
I worked with the new Hamp New Hampshire
 
01:17:41.669 --> 01:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
cannabis Association the New Hampshire
 
01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
Farm Bureau NOA New Hampshire and
 
01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
several other Farm groups to conduct a
 
01:17:51.629 --> 01:17:51.639 align:start position:0%
grower survey uh we had 69 people took
 
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
the survey 87% of The respondents Who
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
currently farm and the majority
 
01:17:59.709 --> 01:17:59.719 align:start position:0%
currently Farm who took the survey
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
87% support legalization while
 
01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
78% of those Farmers express interest in
 
01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
becoming licensed Growers only 11% of
 
01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Farmers support the state
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
being the sole buyer and seller of
 
01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis I understand that Paradigm has
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
shifted a little bit uh with the uh
 
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
franchise model now on the table
 
01:18:25.390 --> 01:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire farmers who took
 
01:18:28.510 --> 01:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
the survey uh support allowing licensed
 
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
Growers to sell cannabis
 
01:18:35.629 --> 01:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
directly with 70% support 133% opposed
 
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
and 177%
 
01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.229 align:start position:0%
and 177%
undecided

01:18:39.229 --> 01:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
undecided
 
01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
89% yes so you looks like you're reading
 
01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
directly from your testimony which has
 
01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
been given to everybody we can all read
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
if you maybe summarize and come out with
 
01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
points of what you want to talk about
 
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
well we can read if I could just this
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
the last statistic I want to present and
 
01:18:56.350 --> 01:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
that's 89% of the respondant support
 
01:18:58.110 --> 01:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
allowing New Hampshire residents to grow
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
6 to8 plants for personal use and I'd
 
01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
like to shift gears now um during the
 
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
last commission meeting Senator abis
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
asked the question how can the draft
 
01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
Bill be strengthened to minimize the
 
01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:11.229 align:start position:0%
Bill be strengthened to minimize the
illicit

01:19:11.229 --> 01:19:11.239 align:start position:0%
illicit
 
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
market and I over the weekend looked
 
01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
through a number of scholarly articles
 
01:19:18.910 --> 01:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
and the best one I found uh is from
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
Washington State titled suppressing
 
01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
illicit cannabis markets after State uh
 
01:19:26.590 --> 01:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
marijuana legalization so directly
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
relevant to the question that was asked
 
01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
and if I could read uh a couple excerpts
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
from that study we found numerous
 
01:19:38.189 --> 01:19:38.199 align:start position:0%
factors in the competition between
 
01:19:40.629 --> 01:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
markets that that may allow illicit
 
01:19:42.990 --> 01:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
supply of cannabis to survive many of
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
these factors can be directly influenced
 
01:19:48.669 --> 01:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
by the regulation of the legal
 
01:19:52.110 --> 01:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
system and uh things that impact that
 
01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
are the level of taxes limits on
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
cultivation capacity and uh the burden
 
01:20:02.189 --> 01:20:02.199 align:start position:0%
of the uh uh traceability uh
 
01:20:02.199 --> 01:20:03.990 align:start position:0%
of the uh uh traceability uh
system

01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:20:07.390 --> 01:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
and to me after reading those studies it
 
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
really is clear that how the regulatory
 
01:20:16.030 --> 01:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
system is structured really impacts the
 
01:20:20.590 --> 01:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
uh elicit market and so in other
 
01:20:25.629 --> 01:20:25.639 align:start position:0%
words the more barriers to being a legal
 
01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
player the more you're favoring the ille
 
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
illegal Market I mean and so some of the
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
things I think that the commission needs
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
to be considering and I think this is
 
01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
number one and that's in your charge is
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
to end prohibition because right now
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire are committing
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
Crimes by purchasing cannabis in
 
01:20:47.950 --> 01:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
neighboring states there's already a
 
01:20:51.229 --> 01:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
thriving illegal Market uh just because
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
prohibition but a allowing home
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
cultivation in every state that was
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
looked at in the study allowed home
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
cultivation that really undercuts the
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
demand for illegal uh products and
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
then the more people have access uh uh
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
the more it harms the illegal market and
 
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
you have to look at why do people buy
 
01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
illegal cannabis it's because
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's lower price often it's
 
01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
convenient that you can have somebody
 
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
come to your house it's a private
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
transaction you don't have to give your
 
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
license number um and there's just a lot
 
01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
of tradition people have been doing it
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
in illegal States uh so they have
 
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
relationships but if you keep the
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
licensing fees low um you will
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
especially for smallscale producers uh
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
you're encourag them to participate in
 
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
the legal uh versus the illegal and the
 
01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
same for the regulatory burdens keeping
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
it simple you want to apply and then
 
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
remain in the legal uh system so having
 
01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:03.629 align:start position:0%
remain in the legal uh system so having
userfriendly

01:22:03.629 --> 01:22:03.639 align:start position:0%
userfriendly
 
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
standardized product tracking that it's
 
01:22:11.070 --> 01:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
easy to be legal and keep track of the
 
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
products and then a public education
 
01:22:16.590 --> 01:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
campaign on those dangers that have been
 
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
talked about earlier by the uh
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
presenters um especially the dangers of
 
01:22:25.629 --> 01:22:25.639 align:start position:0%
illegal cannabis because it's not
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
tested there are potential contaminants
 
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
there is the possibility of a rest um
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
whereas legal cannabis uh needs to be
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
tested not just for potency and Turpin
 
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
and the qualities but also potential
 
01:22:43.070 --> 01:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
contaminants and that's contaminants
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
like mold that was talked about but also
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
contaminants with illegal drugs like
 
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
fentanyl um but I also listened to the
 
01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
comments at the last meeting from the
 
01:22:56.669 --> 01:22:56.679 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General Madison and
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
Mr Madison made it clear uh that a
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
state-owned label which is really what
 
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
you're talking about and then
 
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
franchising the use of that label to
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
retail stores would not isolate the
 
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
state from liability or possible civil
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
suits but he also pointed out that
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
Congress through Appropriations writers
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
has established a carel for medical
 
01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis and given that reality
 
01:23:24.910 --> 01:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
as well as the fact that New Hampshire
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
does have a well-established medical
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
program I've come up with a novel idea
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
and I haven't presented this to anyone
 
01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
except my wife um and that is to build
 
01:23:38.910 --> 01:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
out New Hampshire's legal regulatory
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
framework on the medical program that
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
already exists increase the number of
 
01:23:50.110 --> 01:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
licensed dispensaries and add criteria
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
such as insomnia anxiety appetite
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
self-care in order to qualify for a card
 
01:23:58.510 --> 01:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
and the cards could be sold through the
 
01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
state liquor stores so you're not taking
 
01:24:03.629 --> 01:24:03.639 align:start position:0%
the risk of selling cannabis or branding
 
01:24:07.629 --> 01:24:07.639 align:start position:0%
you are selling cards you are and the
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
dispensaries could also sell these cards
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
and then under this model both residents
 
01:24:15.870 --> 01:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
and out of-state Shoppers could purchase
 
01:24:18.189 --> 01:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
a card for a reasonable
 
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
price they essentially and then they
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
could purchase tax free cannabis in New
 
01:24:25.629 --> 01:24:25.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but essentially you're
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
capturing that Revenue through the
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
purchase of these cards You' have you'd
 
01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:33.400 align:start position:0%
have accountability on who the customers
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
are you could do traceability of Health
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
impacts you also can trace the products
 
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
and when a person would purchase the
 
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
card they would agree to follow all the
 
01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
legal requirements they would agree not
 
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
to provide cannabis to persons who are
 
01:24:52.669 --> 01:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
underage whatever age you decide side
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
that is they would agree not to drive
 
01:24:58.990 --> 01:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
while impaired they would receive those
 
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
warnings not just on the pack that was
 
01:25:04.270 --> 01:25:04.280 align:start position:0%
passed around but in that actual process
 
01:25:06.709 --> 01:25:06.719 align:start position:0%
they would be warned about possible
 
01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
negative uh Health impacts including for
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
pregnant nursing women and they would
 
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
attest to hold the state harmless uh so
 
01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
I think it I know it's a novel idea uh
 
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
but I would like you to consider it
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
um because I think it can protect the
 
01:25:30.149 --> 01:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
state from civil suits it will generate
 
01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue without imposing either an
 
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
excise or a sales tax and it builds on a
 
01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
successful program that already exists
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
so thank for your you for your time and
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
attention thank you Mr riddle questions
 
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:43.400 align:start position:0%
for Mr riddle
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
Frank thanks just one quick question um
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to share the
 
01:25:48.430 --> 01:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
methodology for the survey and the
 
01:25:52.950 --> 01:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
questions you used yes there is a uh uh
 
01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm not
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire cannabis
 
01:25:59.310 --> 01:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
Association I put the survey together
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
there is a very detailed blog post on
 
01:26:07.149 --> 01:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
their website uh NHC can.org uh that
 
01:26:12.149 --> 01:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
shows graphs and uh the methodology is
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
basically I came up with a list of
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
questions that had been you know uh
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
submitted to me when I testified things
 
01:26:21.229 --> 01:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
that it appeared that legislators wanted
 
01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
to know and we worked with uh New
 
01:26:26.910 --> 01:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farm Bureau to refine those
 
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
questions uh then once we had it ready
 
01:26:33.629 --> 01:26:33.639 align:start position:0%
to launch we asked Farm Bureau NOA New
 
01:26:35.629 --> 01:26:35.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is the Northeast organic
 
01:26:38.229 --> 01:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
farming Association of New Hampshire uh
 
01:26:40.189 --> 01:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire herbal Network fruit
 
01:26:42.189 --> 01:26:42.199 align:start position:0%
and vegetable Grower Association a few
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
other Farm groups to help distribute it
 
01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
it was open during about second half of
 
01:26:49.709 --> 01:26:49.719 align:start position:0%
August all of September we closed it
 
01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
September 30th people voluntar L logged
 
01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
in to the website it took about 10
 
01:26:58.030 --> 01:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
minutes they were able to both answer
 
01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
the questions as well as enter comments
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
and we uh will be Shar you know the
 
01:27:04.350 --> 01:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
Cannabis Association will be sharing
 
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
those comments but uh that's basically
 
01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
the methodology so it wasn't that we
 
01:27:11.950 --> 01:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
were calling people up what's your
 
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
opinion on these answers uh it took
 
01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
voluntary initiative on the respondents
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
part cool just one followup follow so in
 
01:27:21.870 --> 01:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
terms of like how representative that
 
01:27:23.149 --> 01:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
because it's seems like 69 is a
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
relatively small number I assume look
 
01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
quickly there's like 40 at least 4,100
 
01:27:30.189 --> 01:27:30.199 align:start position:0%
commercial farms in New Hampshire right
 
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
and and Farm Bureau has a membership of
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
about 2,000 so yes it's a small
 
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
percentage so how representative that is
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
but we we definitely had people
 
01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
motivated uh who were uh opposed you
 
01:27:44.590 --> 01:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
know weigh in it wasn't just targeting
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
or anything it was but it was voluntary
 
01:27:47.709 --> 01:27:47.719 align:start position:0%
okay cool thank you and it was there
 
01:27:50.189 --> 01:27:50.199 align:start position:0%
were several rounds of notices that went
 
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
out inviting people to take the survey
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
further questions for Mr riddle seeing
 
01:27:57.550 --> 01:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
none thank you Mr R thank
 
01:27:59.390 --> 01:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
you all right so here's what I'm going
 
01:28:01.030 --> 01:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
to propose I'm going to take a we'll
 
01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
take a five minute break so we're going
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
to go take a bio Break um and we'll come
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
back we're going to Jump Right In does
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
everybody have a copy of the proposed
 
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
draft language for the bill um if not
 
01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
I'll get that out while we're on break I
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
think is that yeah I think there's
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
copies in there so I'll get them out to
 
01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
everybody and then we're just going to
 
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
start on page one and start walking
 
01:28:21.149 --> 01:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
through the bill so five minute break be
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:51.000 --> 01:33:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
11:35

01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
back all right everyone ready to rock
 
01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
and roll all right does everyone have a
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
draft of I gave it out all right it's
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
when I say it's a draft it's again
 
01:33:22.109 --> 01:33:22.119 align:start position:0%
nothing in here is
 
01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
set but my goal is to kind of go through
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
this B section I'm not saying we do the
 
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
whole thing today uh if there's anything
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
that's in here that is
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
just I don't know we disagree on
 
01:33:37.229 --> 01:33:37.239 align:start position:0%
whatever but we want to make sure this
 
01:33:40.270 --> 01:33:40.280 align:start position:0%
actually can work in the real world um
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not going to necessarily
 
01:33:43.470 --> 01:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
accept testimony from the public right
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
now but you know a thumbs up or a thumbs
 
01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
down you know we'll exercise my
 
01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
discretion if we're going to allow
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
comment on a particular section limited
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
to that
 
01:33:55.870 --> 01:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
all right does anyone have the
 
01:33:58.910 --> 01:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
draft all right do you want to tell the
 
01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
the it just says draft on it so oh I
 
01:34:07.109 --> 01:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
didn't know if you took it from
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
something it's not it's not a a previous
 
01:34:11.709 --> 01:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
bill that has ever been
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
filed so it's kind of a combination of
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
several bills that have been filed so
 
01:34:18.669 --> 01:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
the reference one bill number would
 
01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
probably be confusing um but this is
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
what we got so far for Mr chair I did
 
01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
put out the extra copies we had every
 
01:34:30.510 --> 01:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
member got distributed one and we put
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
some extras out for the public to be
 
01:34:33.229 --> 01:34:33.239 align:start position:0%
able to read so they could follow along
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
with our current
 
01:34:39.229 --> 01:34:39.239 align:start position:0%
draft right so Mr sh just a question so
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
we got some suggested language from new
 
01:34:43.629 --> 01:34:43.639 align:start position:0%
Futures I didn't know if that was
 
01:34:46.229 --> 01:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
incorporated into this draft I'm I don't
 
01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
believe so but that's I didn't want to
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
keep handing out drafts and making
 
01:34:51.629 --> 01:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
changes to the draft because there's no
 
01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
reference number of this so it's not
 
01:34:56.350 --> 01:34:56.360 align:start position:0%
that I don't value what the new futures
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
um input would be but I just didn't want
 
01:34:59.870 --> 01:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
to make any more changes since I already
 
01:35:01.950 --> 01:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
started circulating that but when we get
 
01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
to the sections that would apply um
 
01:35:06.109 --> 01:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
obviously you please please bring that
 
01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
up okay so page
 
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
one uh I think it's just it's purpose in
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
finding personally I think you can just
 
01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
strike the higher first paragraph I
 
01:35:20.109 --> 01:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
don't think it's necessary to make that
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
you want to leave
 
01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
it so Mr chair if we're going to leave
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
it I I do want to strike at least a
 
01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
couple words out of it I think the
 
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
taxation I'm okay with the whole idea
 
01:35:37.790 --> 01:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
that we strike it because again um not
 
01:35:39.870 --> 01:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have any force or eff of law
 
01:35:41.430 --> 01:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
it's just more of a policy statement
 
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
than anything else so it's not
 
01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily means anything but if we are
 
01:35:47.149 --> 01:35:47.159 align:start position:0%
going to do it uh leave it I want to
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
strike the word law uh after allowing
 
01:35:51.550 --> 01:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
where it says law enforcement to focus
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
on violent and property crimes and just
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
strike that and move on to the rest
 
01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
about generation Revenue generation my
 
01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
purpose in in in making if if we move
 
01:36:02.189 --> 01:36:02.199 align:start position:0%
forward with the legalization model it's
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
not because I want law enforcement to
 
01:36:04.990 --> 01:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
focus it it's because we either think
 
01:36:08.109 --> 01:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
it's legal and we should do it um or not
 
01:36:09.790 --> 01:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
but it's not about law enforcement
 
01:36:11.470 --> 01:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
focusing on violent crimes and property
 
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
crimes um there you should be focusing
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
on crimes period um so I just want to
 
01:36:19.229 --> 01:36:19.239 align:start position:0%
strike that law enforcement to to focus
 
01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
on violent and property crimes because
 
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be
 
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
something our state is looking to do is
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
have them focus on that we should have
 
01:36:27.070 --> 01:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
them focus on just enforcing the law
 
01:36:29.709 --> 01:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
perod that paragraph is and and whether
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
you agree with what it says or not has
 
01:36:33.709 --> 01:36:33.719 align:start position:0%
no impact on the policy so it just makes
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
a long Bill longer and I'm just trying
 
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
to cut this down I if that doesn't mean
 
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't there's not good points
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
in there I
 
01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:44.550 align:start position:0%
in there I
just

01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:36:47.109 --> 01:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you Mr chair uh
 
01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
the reason I suggested leaving it in is
 
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh from the comments that were made by
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
by the attorney general and that the
 
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
state needs to document
 
01:36:58.590 --> 01:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
why it's doing what it's doing in light
 
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
of a federal prohibition that exists so
 
01:37:04.510 --> 01:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
you're creating a
 
01:37:08.830 --> 01:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
guidance I think uh where this while it
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
has no effect on the policy within the
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
state it does have a defense when you
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
get into a challenge to the law either
 
01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
at the state or federal
 
01:37:20.199 --> 01:37:23.750 align:start position:0%
at the state or federal
level

01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
for my testimony I don't uh know that
 
01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:28.430 align:start position:0%
for my testimony I don't uh know that
the

01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
findings um would have relevance for any
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
federal enforcement action um it's
 
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
really the the underlying regime or
 
01:37:40.189 --> 01:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
compliance with that regime that may to
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
your comment about civil
 
01:37:42.239 --> 01:37:44.229 align:start position:0%
your comment about civil
liability

01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
liability
 
01:37:46.990 --> 01:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
um for example using that New York case
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's a preemption Challenge and so the
 
01:37:52.669 --> 01:37:52.679 align:start position:0%
uh the state finding wouldn't influence
 
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
enforceability under um a federal claim
 
01:38:00.109 --> 01:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
so um I I wouldn't want my testimony
 
01:38:02.430 --> 01:38:02.440 align:start position:0%
from from last week to indicate that the
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
documentation of a purpose um is
 
01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
necessarily a uh mitigates risk or or
 
01:38:12.070 --> 01:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
legal risk Mr
 
01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
chair um understanding what you're
 
01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
saying there however when uh other uh
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
legislation we had
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
has relied upon findings in order to
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
justify its existence particularly when
 
01:38:30.189 --> 01:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
it comes to a federal level and when you
 
01:38:33.149 --> 01:38:33.159 align:start position:0%
put down and saying that we're firmly
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
placing the state of New Hampshire in
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
this case in Contra or contraposition to
 
01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:42.280 align:start position:0%
the position of the federal government
 
01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
you're immediately moving this to where
 
01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:46.360 align:start position:0%
eventually it's going to have to be
 
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
resolved because you're creating a uh
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional uh Point CounterPoint in
 
01:38:55.390 --> 01:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph uh of the
 
01:38:58.589 --> 01:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
legislation which would then allow
 
01:39:00.790 --> 01:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
somebody to go down to Washington and
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
have some fun standing up and going oh
 
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
you glorious people up there so let me
 
01:39:10.390 --> 01:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
just focus so on that there's 13 of us
 
01:39:13.790 --> 01:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
here does if you support leaving that
 
01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:16.679 align:start position:0%
par that's uh that section in there
 
01:39:20.270 --> 01:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
that's page one that's paragraph one you
 
01:39:21.629 --> 01:39:21.639 align:start position:0%
want to leave it in there we can make
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
some changes just if you support leaving
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
it in just raise your
 
01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
hand striking it just
 
01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
gone and then that again I don't think
 
01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:33.830 align:start position:0%
gone and then that again I don't think
that

01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
that I think and then going to section
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
two um I think when it comes
 
01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
to section e it says canvas so the stage
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
will be tested labeled and subject to
 
01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
additional regulations to ensure that
 
01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
the consumers are informed and pro
 
01:39:52.750 --> 01:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
protected and protect the environment at
 
01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
section uh
 
01:39:57.589 --> 01:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
2E um there's been some suggestion that
 
01:40:00.669 --> 01:40:00.679 align:start position:0%
maybe the testing is done by the state I
 
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the state would have to
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
do that themselves it should be a
 
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
private company the state can contract
 
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
with I think I don't there's any comment
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
on that or
 
01:40:14.669 --> 01:40:14.679 align:start position:0%
any any direction we should go
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
Mr again I don't I don't think that that
 
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
that section e States whether it's state
 
01:40:22.270 --> 01:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
tested or state an independent lab
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
tested um I think by just leaving the
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
statement in there I think it's clear
 
01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
that testing is required and then how we
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
do the testing can be can be worked out
 
01:40:31.589 --> 01:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming there's some testing
 
01:40:33.950 --> 01:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
language later on that talks about that
 
01:40:34.990 --> 01:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
we can talk about whether it's an
 
01:40:37.149 --> 01:40:37.159 align:start position:0%
independent lab or a state run lab I
 
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
think it would kind of be against it
 
01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
would be I hate to use this terminology
 
01:40:44.589 --> 01:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
but the fox you know uh guarding the hen
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
house we' let the state test its own
 
01:40:47.589 --> 01:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
product and allow it for legalization
 
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
for sale within its own facilities um I
 
01:40:51.109 --> 01:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
think we'd scream about that in a
 
01:40:52.750 --> 01:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
private industry and I think we should
 
01:40:54.589 --> 01:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
probably scream about that in a in a
 
01:40:56.189 --> 01:40:56.199 align:start position:0%
state run industry as well that an
 
01:40:58.270 --> 01:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
independent outside lab testing is
 
01:41:00.830 --> 01:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate so I would leave that as it
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
is Mr chairman um the we believe that in
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
point of fact uh we do test our own
 
01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
products uh in this state for example uh
 
01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
blood uh samples for DWI is tested by a
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
state lab we the Chiefs believe that U
 
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
this should remain in state the testing
 
01:41:20.510 --> 01:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
facility should be a state one facility
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
I think it definitely remain in the
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
state it's just whether it's run no and
 
01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
what we believe it should be a state a
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
yes we can I think with what Senator
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
Lang said that we you know leaving it as
 
01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
it is we can address that when it comes
 
01:41:39.629 --> 01:41:39.639 align:start position:0%
to the actual policy in the bill um for
 
01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2f it says some tax revenue I
 
01:41:47.629 --> 01:41:47.639 align:start position:0%
I would just put some of the tax just
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
strike that out so revenue generated
 
01:41:51.149 --> 01:41:51.159 align:start position:0%
from legal cannabis will be sport
 
01:41:54.189 --> 01:41:54.199 align:start position:0%
programs for and go from there Mr chair
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to also add a potential G
 
01:41:58.510 --> 01:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
that was recommended which I think is a
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
good one adding as G the marketing and
 
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
advertising of cannabis to miners shall
 
01:42:04.669 --> 01:42:04.679 align:start position:0%
be prohibited I think you know based on
 
01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
our conversation today that's a
 
01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
minimum and you want to add that to g to
 
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
g uh one two
 
01:42:15.629 --> 01:42:15.639 align:start position:0%
G one two
 
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
G all right does anyone have a problem
 
01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
with that nope I I think that's that's
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
very reasonable
 
01:42:24.270 --> 01:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
recommend it I um you have this
 
01:42:28.229 --> 01:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:30.270 --> 01:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
a I
 
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
want I'd rather write that write down
 
01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:42.709 align:start position:0%
want I'd rather write that write down
that

01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
section you have
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:53.870 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:42:53.870 --> 01:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
and the just for the committee's
 
01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
commission's doc uh reference this is
 
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.310 --> 01:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
at FS have
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
this the
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
memo does anybody oppose to adding
 
01:43:14.350 --> 01:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
letter g in that that line about no no
 
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
we're good no one no one on the
 
01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
commission supports advertising canas to
 
01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
M good a press in the
 
01:43:25.109 --> 01:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
room right new the then if you go to
 
01:43:27.070 --> 01:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
line 34 page one it's the new sub
 
01:43:40.589 --> 01:43:40.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh think it gets into the substance
 
01:43:45.310 --> 01:43:45.320 align:start position:0%
abuse in Recovery Fund management
 
01:43:47.950 --> 01:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
distribution of the
 
01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
funds anyone have any comment on that
 
01:43:54.430 --> 01:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
section Mr
 
01:44:00.030 --> 01:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
chairman is that section paragraph F you
 
01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:00.910 align:start position:0%
chairman is that section paragraph F you
talking

01:44:00.910 --> 01:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
talking
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
F yes to section F uh could you
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
shall I'm sorry Chief where are you at
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
um par
 
01:44:28.270 --> 01:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:31.470 --> 01:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
revenue it's shall be used Asos as
 
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:46.270 --> 01:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
to it's basically the whole the entire
 
01:44:58.870 --> 01:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
page to is it's the substance abuse a
 
01:45:00.550 --> 01:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
prevention and Recovery Fund and
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
management distribution funds does
 
01:45:04.350 --> 01:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
anyone have any comment on that yeah so
 
01:45:06.990 --> 01:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
again referencing that new Futures memo
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
there there was a suggestion to add
 
01:45:11.109 --> 01:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
treatment so we would be adding
 
01:45:12.629 --> 01:45:12.639 align:start position:0%
treatment to
 
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
online five in the title so it would be
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
Substance Abuse Prevention treatment and
 
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
Recovery funds adding it in line seven
 
01:45:23.070 --> 01:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
substance Abuse Prevention treatment and
 
01:45:25.870 --> 01:45:25.880 align:start position:0%
Recovery funds and then again on line 12
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
sh administr to Substance Abuse
 
01:45:29.589 --> 01:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
Prevention treatment and recovery 5 S
 
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
M you want to add substance
 
01:45:44.229 --> 01:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
treatment uh I think there might be one
 
01:45:47.790 --> 01:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:12.910 --> 01:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
that for all the the the treatment
 
01:46:17.950 --> 01:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
programs here are these any any of these
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
going to be private treatment programs
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
or are they all is it all just going to
 
01:46:27.629 --> 01:46:27.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:30.109 --> 01:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
it none of this says whether it's state
 
01:46:31.589 --> 01:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
run or federal run it's just that the
 
01:46:33.390 --> 01:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
funding can be used for it so I assume
 
01:46:36.550 --> 01:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
it could be both um state run or private
 
01:46:39.950 --> 01:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
centers and how would and how would a
 
01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
private Treatment Center get get access
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:46:47.390 --> 01:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
funding well that's how they do it now
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
right so they apply an individual would
 
01:46:51.149 --> 01:46:51.159 align:start position:0%
apply to DHHS for for a substance under
 
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
a substance abuse and um and go to a
 
01:46:55.310 --> 01:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
treatment center whether it's alcohol
 
01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
opioids or anything else and they would
 
01:47:01.229 --> 01:47:01.239 align:start position:0%
be granted funding um and DH just has
 
01:47:01.239 --> 01:47:07.149 align:start position:0%
be granted funding um and DH just has
approved

01:47:07.149 --> 01:47:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:11.950 --> 01:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
programs how would we establish by rule
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
on page
 
01:47:24.589 --> 01:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:27.589 --> 01:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
chairman would just the wording here
 
01:47:31.229 --> 01:47:31.239 align:start position:0%
that U fund shall be deposited into the
 
01:47:33.870 --> 01:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
that fund and the St divide commissioner
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:47:36.750 --> 01:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
in coordination with the governor
 
01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
Commission on Alcohol and Other
 
01:47:42.430 --> 01:47:42.440 align:start position:0%
Drugs are we saying are we saying the
 
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
funding from whatever tax or Revenue
 
01:47:48.189 --> 01:47:48.199 align:start position:0%
this bill would go would go into the
 
01:47:50.109 --> 01:47:50.119 align:start position:0%
governor's commission with the alcohol
 
01:47:52.149 --> 01:47:52.159 align:start position:0%
fund funds and then be like it is now
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
and then be administered by the by HHS
 
01:47:59.870 --> 01:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.430 --> 01:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
now right now the alcohol fund the money
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
actually goes to the commission and then
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
that then then whatever allocations they
 
01:48:11.589 --> 01:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
make to the HHS
 
01:48:15.229 --> 01:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
then uh does the actual uh
 
01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:17.320 align:start position:0%
funding the way I read this it would go
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
into the
 
01:48:22.510 --> 01:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
same it's not clear here whether that's
 
01:48:24.910 --> 01:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
what but the way the way it's written on
 
01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
and on the second page it looks like it
 
01:48:30.030 --> 01:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
goes to the same fund and is there any
 
01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
issue on commingling the f I guess
 
01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:37.390 align:start position:0%
issue on commingling the f I guess
that's

01:48:37.390 --> 01:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:49.199 --> 01:48:53.149 align:start position:0%
 
number

01:48:53.149 --> 01:48:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:55.639 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I would say from an accounting
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
standpoint the money the the revenues
 
01:49:01.470 --> 01:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
need to flow through the commission to
 
01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
the fund for auditing uh from an
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
auditing standpoint so because the
 
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
commission will be in charge of the
 
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
sales just like we do with the alcohol
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
fund so much of that money from the
 
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
revenues of the commission flows into
 
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:22.719 align:start position:0%
the fund so if we're saying the
 
01:49:24.990 --> 01:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
revenue minus
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
whatever uh working capital the
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
commission needs the the proceeds would
 
01:49:38.669 --> 01:49:38.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
fund Mr
 
01:49:42.629 --> 01:49:42.639 align:start position:0%
chairman we're just a little bit
 
01:49:44.350 --> 01:49:44.360 align:start position:0%
concerned with the potential of
 
01:49:45.709 --> 01:49:45.719 align:start position:0%
co-mingling of
 
01:49:48.189 --> 01:49:48.199 align:start position:0%
funds and we were wondering if we
 
01:49:50.109 --> 01:49:50.119 align:start position:0%
couldn't add something to the effect of
 
01:49:51.950 --> 01:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
of a can cannabis Substance Abuse
 
01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
Prevention and Recovery Fund an
 
01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
independent fund that would keep
 
01:50:00.270 --> 01:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
whatever uh funds come from sales Etc
 
01:50:03.109 --> 01:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
separate distinct what yeah so I I
 
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
actually was looking at the the um the
 
01:50:09.189 --> 01:50:09.199 align:start position:0%
new Futures and it it looks like they um
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
when they're suggesting some changes
 
01:50:12.750 --> 01:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
they actually didn't highlight an area
 
01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
and so I was looking back at that and
 
01:50:16.109 --> 01:50:16.119 align:start position:0%
that was there saying insert at the
 
01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
beginning of the bill that in addition
 
01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
to treatment um to creation of a
 
01:50:22.669 --> 01:50:22.679 align:start position:0%
separate non-aps fund for prevention
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
treatment and Recovery that does seem
 
01:50:28.510 --> 01:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
like a reasonable idea but so at the at
 
01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:29.490 align:start position:0%
the top here in the
 
01:50:29.490 --> 01:50:31.470 align:start position:0%
the top here in the
[Music]

01:50:31.470 --> 01:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:50:38.149 --> 01:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:44.510 --> 01:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:47.550 --> 01:50:47.560 align:start position:0%
last so you know what we're looking at
 
01:50:52.229 --> 01:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:54.830 --> 01:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
there it is I told I had it I just there
 
01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
you go I'm trying to multitask take
 
01:51:00.030 --> 01:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
notes I need I need four hands to do
 
01:51:01.870 --> 01:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm doing so I was trying to cheat
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
off yours sorry doing a good job oh no
 
01:51:08.229 --> 01:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
she kept tell she she's tough she gab me
 
01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
down all right so we we we need
 
01:51:15.629 --> 01:51:15.639 align:start position:0%
to make a had this be a separate fund a
 
01:51:18.589 --> 01:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
dedicated a dedicated fund yeah do laure
 
01:51:21.950 --> 01:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
a dedicated dog la a dedicated fund with
 
01:51:23.589 --> 01:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
a similar objective but it has to be
 
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
separate it also needs to pass through
 
01:51:28.270 --> 01:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
liquor for auditing purposes is that the
 
01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
consensus y i I just want to make sure
 
01:51:33.030 --> 01:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
the the governor's Commission on Alcohol
 
01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
and Other Drugs they have a they come
 
01:51:38.910 --> 01:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
out with a three-year plan and they they
 
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
have legis as you know legislative
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
appointed uh members on there uh and
 
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
people from the subject matter experts
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
and they come up with a plan on what's
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
best how to how to um use funding that
 
01:51:58.350 --> 01:51:58.360 align:start position:0%
they get for the alcohol fund and and I
 
01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
believe that I believe that the money
 
01:52:03.069 --> 01:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
should be put into that fund to be
 
01:52:05.390 --> 01:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
consistent why I have two funds I just
 
01:52:07.310 --> 01:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
want to make sure why have two different
 
01:52:10.589 --> 01:52:10.599 align:start position:0%
funds to do the same thing well
 
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
fundamentally I agree with you but I
 
01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
think there was concerned about mixing
 
01:52:18.669 --> 01:52:18.679 align:start position:0%
the alcohol that's revenue from alcohol
 
01:52:20.790 --> 01:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
sales with
 
01:52:22.830 --> 01:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
revenue from Cannabis
 
01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
sales I think one of the one of the
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
reasons you should have something
 
01:52:29.430 --> 01:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
separate is the alcohol money goes to a
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
few different
 
01:52:33.470 --> 01:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
places this money would be specifically
 
01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:35.679 align:start position:0%
for Canabis period it would be
 
01:52:38.350 --> 01:52:38.360 align:start position:0%
specifically for the kist non- elapsing
 
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund the alcohol fund now is
 
01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
used for a variety of purposes we use it
 
01:52:47.229 --> 01:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
in in for the Medicaid expansion which
 
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
is a key key issue which I I think think
 
01:52:52.030 --> 01:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the alcohol fund was
 
01:52:55.109 --> 01:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
never never a purpose so that's been
 
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
designed it's a new purpose it's been
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
created and it's quite specific chief
 
01:53:01.950 --> 01:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
that that that it's that it's going
 
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
there U and I and I think the
 
01:53:07.589 --> 01:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
flexibility of the alcohol fund is
 
01:53:09.310 --> 01:53:09.320 align:start position:0%
something that has been uh the
 
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
legislature has used on a number of
 
01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
occasions that's that's all I'm I'm just
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
putting out that there is flexibility
 
01:53:17.950 --> 01:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
there has been flexibility there where
 
01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:20.719 align:start position:0%
this would be much more specific
 
01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
if this would be a dedicated flood to
 
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
wood for wood purpose
 
01:53:29.790 --> 01:53:29.800 align:start position:0%
so chair if you look at the new Futures
 
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:38.229 --> 01:53:38.239 align:start position:0%
here I'm not gonna lie I haven't read
 
01:53:40.990 --> 01:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
this old paragraph in a while if you
 
01:53:43.350 --> 01:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
just cut that and put that in here but
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
this uh uh so this is this paragraph is
 
01:53:49.950 --> 01:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
already in and we're just adding the
 
01:53:52.030 --> 01:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
green but then this is what they're
 
01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:56.069 align:start position:0%
green but then this is what they're
talking

01:53:56.069 --> 01:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
about so Mr chair if I can for one
 
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
minute so again I I tend to agree with
 
01:54:05.109 --> 01:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh David over there in that um I'm not
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
just remember we have a cannabis fund
 
01:54:09.069 --> 01:54:09.079 align:start position:0%
which is the first segmentation of money
 
01:54:10.589 --> 01:54:10.599 align:start position:0%
right that that comes from the retail
 
01:54:12.750 --> 01:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
stores and goes into the Cannabis fund
 
01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's from that cannabis fund that we
 
01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
then disperse the other rest of the
 
01:54:18.910 --> 01:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
funds from so in in the case of
 
01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
dispersement when we get down there we
 
01:54:23.669 --> 01:54:23.679 align:start position:0%
send 50% to education in this in this
 
01:54:25.629 --> 01:54:25.639 align:start position:0%
model which means we're now mixing
 
01:54:27.950 --> 01:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis funds with education so why are
 
01:54:29.669 --> 01:54:29.679 align:start position:0%
we concerned about mixing cannabis funds
 
01:54:32.350 --> 01:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
with treatment programs um because every
 
01:54:34.069 --> 01:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
person I heard testify talk about
 
01:54:35.550 --> 01:54:35.560 align:start position:0%
treatment didn't talk about treatment
 
01:54:37.950 --> 01:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
with cannabis alone they talked about
 
01:54:39.629 --> 01:54:39.639 align:start position:0%
treatment in conjunction with opioids
 
01:54:40.709 --> 01:54:40.719 align:start position:0%
and treatment in conjunction with
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
alcohol treatment uh in conjunction with
 
01:54:44.830 --> 01:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
other uh you know prescription drug
 
01:54:46.830 --> 01:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
medication right so again I think
 
01:54:49.109 --> 01:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
treatment and and rehabil not
 
01:54:51.229 --> 01:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation but um those other
 
01:54:54.830 --> 01:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
services are treatment right and so
 
01:54:56.510 --> 01:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
segmenting it out I don't know that
 
01:54:57.629 --> 01:54:57.639 align:start position:0%
anybody's going to walk through the door
 
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
and say I just have a marijuana problem
 
01:55:02.069 --> 01:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
and that's the only thing they have and
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
and that's what this money would only be
 
01:55:06.270 --> 01:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
used for so I think it it we we better
 
01:55:07.950 --> 01:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
serve the citizens of the Hampshire by
 
01:55:09.709 --> 01:55:09.719 align:start position:0%
putting it into the treatment fund and
 
01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
allowing for the broad base of treatment
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
and services which would include alcohol
 
01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
and other opioid
 
01:55:18.910 --> 01:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
addictions she wants it looks like she
 
01:55:21.069 --> 01:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
wants to say something
 
01:55:24.030 --> 01:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman I'm fine with the money
 
01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
going into the fund I just want to make
 
01:55:31.550 --> 01:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
sure that the accounting of the money
 
01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:33.069 align:start position:0%
sure that the accounting of the money
is

01:55:33.069 --> 01:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
separated in the liquor ledgers as
 
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
separate funds and if the money goes
 
01:55:42.350 --> 01:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
into a dedicated fund that's fine we
 
01:55:43.950 --> 01:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
again like everything else The Liquor
 
01:55:46.750 --> 01:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
Commission does we we're we're neutral
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
on how you use the money we just want to
 
01:55:51.310 --> 01:55:51.320 align:start position:0%
make sure the accounting process of
 
01:55:53.109 --> 01:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
where the money comes from and an
 
01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
auditing trail of where the money comes
 
01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
from Mr separate representative from new
 
01:55:59.629 --> 01:55:59.639 align:start position:0%
Futures I know we been referencing the
 
01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
Handover that you provide to us if you
 
01:56:04.229 --> 01:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
can just perhaps well and I as a
 
01:56:07.069 --> 01:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
followup to this conversation I I wanted
 
01:56:11.310 --> 01:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
to know if this was added because of the
 
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
concern that the alcohol fund is always
 
01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:18.510 align:start position:0%
concern that the alcohol fund is always
raided

01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:22.069 --> 01:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
okay Kate fry vice president of advocacy
 
01:56:23.589 --> 01:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
from new Futures I'm sorry didn't
 
01:56:26.669 --> 01:56:26.679 align:start position:0%
explain this section well enough in um
 
01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:28.719 align:start position:0%
The Narrative for this what I was
 
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
pointing out is that treatment should be
 
01:56:32.550 --> 01:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
in that title because it's the full
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
Continuum prevention treatment and
 
01:56:37.109 --> 01:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
recovery but what I neglected to say is
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
in our principles what we have said is
 
01:56:43.709 --> 01:56:43.719 align:start position:0%
that the funding from um uh cannabis
 
01:56:46.390 --> 01:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
sales just like we have in the past with
 
01:56:50.149 --> 01:56:50.159 align:start position:0%
alcohol should go to reduce the harm
 
01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
of an addictive product that for um is
 
01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
um on this on being sold in New
 
01:56:57.709 --> 01:56:57.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so what we've learned from the
 
01:57:01.069 --> 01:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
alcohol fund 20 years in the making um
 
01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
it was fully funded at 5% this year 20
 
01:57:07.589 --> 01:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
years after it was put into place it
 
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
never had before it never had been
 
01:57:11.550 --> 01:57:11.560 align:start position:0%
funded before because the way it was
 
01:57:13.709 --> 01:57:13.719 align:start position:0%
constructed it was often swept out
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
during the budget process and used for
 
01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
other means and so what we did this year
 
01:57:23.229 --> 01:57:23.239 align:start position:0%
or in previous drafts of cannabis
 
01:57:24.950 --> 01:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
languages we learned from the alcohol
 
01:57:27.470 --> 01:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
fund and what we learned from actually
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
the opiate abatement dollars that were
 
01:57:32.750 --> 01:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
coming into the state was to complete um
 
01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
to set up a completely separate Fund in
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
the treasury that cannot be touched and
 
01:57:41.229 --> 01:57:41.239 align:start position:0%
can't be incorporated into the general
 
01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
fund we merely just cut and Pace that
 
01:57:47.310 --> 01:57:47.320 align:start position:0%
opiate abatement fund language and we
 
01:57:49.550 --> 01:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
created this fund and I agree with with
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
the commissioner because of accounting
 
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
with the liquor revenues we feel that
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
those funds should be separated but on
 
01:58:00.030 --> 01:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
the concern um why we have the
 
01:58:01.390 --> 01:58:01.400 align:start position:0%
connection with the governor's
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
Commission in their very important role
 
01:58:07.270 --> 01:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
of strategizing for the state we do feel
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
like they should have an understanding
 
01:58:12.830 --> 01:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
of how much is coming into the state for
 
01:58:14.910 --> 01:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
through canabas through alcohol and the
 
01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
larger strategic plan and help advise
 
01:58:21.069 --> 01:58:21.079 align:start position:0%
where the funding should go in both of
 
01:58:23.310 --> 01:58:23.320 align:start position:0%
those pots because they're in charge of
 
01:58:26.270 --> 01:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
the larger issue of substance misuse and
 
01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
have a say on that instead of creating a
 
01:58:31.109 --> 01:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
separate advisory commission so two
 
01:58:33.830 --> 01:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
different funds but a commission that is
 
01:58:36.109 --> 01:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
working with the Department on the
 
01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:38.719 align:start position:0%
oversight one commission basically
 
01:58:40.910 --> 01:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
overseeing two different funds yes but
 
01:58:42.750 --> 01:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
with the larger issue of prevention
 
01:58:45.950 --> 01:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:47.709 align:start position:0%
 
Recovery

01:58:47.709 --> 01:58:47.719 align:start position:0%
Recovery
 
01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
I if it can be done done with the two
 
01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
with that fund
 
01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
going if the language could say that the
 
01:58:59.149 --> 01:58:59.159 align:start position:0%
uh alcohol uh Commission on Alcohol and
 
01:59:02.510 --> 01:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
Other the drugs would have the same I
 
01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to say power the
 
01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
same ability to be able to allocate
 
01:59:09.790 --> 01:59:09.800 align:start position:0%
those funds and then I just want to make
 
01:59:13.350 --> 01:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
sure that it's that group is deciding
 
01:59:15.149 --> 01:59:15.159 align:start position:0%
where that money is going I think we can
 
01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:17.159 align:start position:0%
we can reserve making a recommendation
 
01:59:19.510 --> 01:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
on this and perhaps we'll kind to
 
01:59:22.669 --> 01:59:22.679 align:start position:0%
consult with someone in DHHS on this
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
particularly and maybe we can talk to
 
01:59:28.069 --> 01:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
someone that's on the uh Governor's
 
01:59:30.069 --> 01:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
Commission on alcohol it certainly was
 
01:59:31.870 --> 01:59:31.880 align:start position:0%
my intent with this language with the
 
01:59:33.669 --> 01:59:33.679 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on alcohol because
 
01:59:36.550 --> 01:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
they are the oversight of the alcohol
 
01:59:39.189 --> 01:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
fund so that was my intent but if we can
 
01:59:40.990 --> 01:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
tighten that up I'm happy to help with
 
01:59:43.189 --> 01:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
this we're on the same page yeah so Mr J
 
01:59:45.310 --> 01:59:45.320 align:start position:0%
again under section three it's pretty
 
01:59:47.589 --> 01:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
clear again I guess this just creates
 
01:59:48.990 --> 01:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
two separate funds keeps them separate
 
01:59:51.709 --> 01:59:51.719 align:start position:0%
but still allows uh the DHHS to work
 
01:59:54.350 --> 01:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
with the governor's commission um to
 
01:59:56.390 --> 01:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
deal with dispersement yeah and so under
 
01:59:57.950 --> 01:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
section three so I think we're actually
 
01:59:59.149 --> 01:59:59.159 align:start position:0%
okay even though we kind of talked
 
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
ourselves into a circle um but I think
 
02:00:03.189 --> 02:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
we're actually okay we can add the
 
02:00:04.950 --> 02:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
treatment language again that is the
 
02:00:08.069 --> 02:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
specific under 12j chapter 12j it's the
 
02:00:09.990 --> 02:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on alcohol and
 
02:00:11.550 --> 02:00:11.560 align:start position:0%
drug abuse prevention treatment and
 
02:00:14.189 --> 02:00:14.199 align:start position:0%
Recovery yeah right so that's what it's
 
02:00:16.589 --> 02:00:16.599 align:start position:0%
consistent with that with their charge
 
02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
and so I think we're actually okay if we
 
02:00:19.709 --> 02:00:19.719 align:start position:0%
just add the word treatment in there
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
section three still allows the um the
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
governor's commission to work with DHHS
 
02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
on dispersement of funds for appropriate
 
02:00:32.030 --> 02:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
programs so it's it's fine fine is
 
02:00:33.790 --> 02:00:33.800 align:start position:0%
adding the treatment is
 
02:00:36.390 --> 02:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
that that really is all that has to be
 
02:00:38.830 --> 02:00:38.840 align:start position:0%
done because that's from a previous um
 
02:00:40.910 --> 02:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
what you have I believe in this is from
 
02:00:43.229 --> 02:00:43.239 align:start position:0%
the previous draft Yeah so it's on five
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
online five 7 12 and
 
02:00:48.119 --> 02:00:54.830 align:start position:0%
online five 7 12 and
14

02:00:54.830 --> 02:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:56.830 --> 02:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
not to keep on talking about I just want
 
02:00:58.550 --> 02:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the language is is
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
clear enough that these funds would work
 
02:01:04.669 --> 02:01:04.679 align:start position:0%
the same way as the alcohol fund where
 
02:01:07.830 --> 02:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
it is the commission who decides where
 
02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
the money is going to go and then the
 
02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
HHS then administr here it's not clear
 
02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
it's just ask it it seems to give the
 
02:01:19.149 --> 02:01:19.159 align:start position:0%
ability and power to HHS with input from
 
02:01:22.149 --> 02:01:22.159 align:start position:0%
I believe I copied the language for the
 
02:01:23.390 --> 02:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
Governor's commission with the
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
relationship with the alcohol fund we
 
02:01:27.310 --> 02:01:27.320 align:start position:0%
can go back and double check but I think
 
02:01:30.149 --> 02:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
I copied that language already in there
 
02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
we can double check that and in in
 
02:01:35.310 --> 02:01:35.320 align:start position:0%
respect to section three on L
 
02:01:38.109 --> 02:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
21 if there's any maybe a suggested
 
02:01:40.470 --> 02:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
language we can present that the next
 
02:01:42.390 --> 02:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
meeting Dave maybe if you if you could
 
02:01:43.870 --> 02:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
look at that and see how you want to
 
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
rewrite that section which talks about
 
02:01:49.790 --> 02:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
02:01:52.030 --> 02:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
making distributions from the fund so
 
02:01:53.310 --> 02:01:53.320 align:start position:0%
why don't you look at that and see if
 
02:01:54.390 --> 02:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
you can come back at the next meeting
 
02:01:56.109 --> 02:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
with language that would be suffice for
 
02:01:57.750 --> 02:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
the Governor's Council okay for the
 
02:02:01.990 --> 02:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:04.510 --> 02:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
you all right so on to page onto page
 
02:02:06.149 --> 02:02:06.159 align:start position:0%
three I think the begin top of that page
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
is just discussing the report that would
 
02:02:10.430 --> 02:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
be provided every every two years which
 
02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
is similar that's done a lot of
 
02:02:13.870 --> 02:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
different so we don't think we need to
 
02:02:16.990 --> 02:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
really cover that um M actually you have
 
02:02:20.589 --> 02:02:20.599 align:start position:0%
a question Mr chair so
 
02:02:23.350 --> 02:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
right now it's the duty and
 
02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:25.069 align:start position:0%
right now it's the duty and
responsibility

02:02:25.069 --> 02:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
of the alcohol commission to provide the
 
02:02:31.589 --> 02:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
F report about the uh programs um and
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
the and the efficacy of those programs
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
so was our goal here is to move this
 
02:02:39.870 --> 02:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
over to DHHS now or is to leave the that
 
02:02:44.430 --> 02:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
reporting mechanism in with um the fund
 
02:02:46.669 --> 02:02:46.679 align:start position:0%
with the Commissioners so it says a
 
02:02:48.270 --> 02:02:48.280 align:start position:0%
report on cost effective and outcomes
 
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
programs required under Section again
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at 12 J5 commencing January
 
02:02:54.990 --> 02:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
1st 2020 and annually thereafter the
 
02:02:57.629 --> 02:02:57.639 align:start position:0%
commission has to issue a report so my
 
02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
question is do we need to create another
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
report because they're already talking
 
02:03:03.550 --> 02:03:03.560 align:start position:0%
about each report will contain
 
02:03:05.830 --> 02:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
evaluation of four programs treatment
 
02:03:08.109 --> 02:03:08.119 align:start position:0%
programs prevention programs programs
 
02:03:10.470 --> 02:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
selected to be chosen from among the 10
 
02:03:12.310 --> 02:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
highest dollar programs so they already
 
02:03:14.990 --> 02:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
have a full reporting requirement for
 
02:03:16.910 --> 02:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
distribution of funds and the programs
 
02:03:18.629 --> 02:03:18.639 align:start position:0%
they support is Our intention to create
 
02:03:20.910 --> 02:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
a other report that they have to create
 
02:03:23.709 --> 02:03:23.719 align:start position:0%
I I think as long as money is going to
 
02:03:25.830 --> 02:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
be allocated to this fund and
 
02:03:28.430 --> 02:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
distributed with with the discretion of
 
02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:29.669 align:start position:0%
distributed with with the discretion of
by

02:03:29.669 --> 02:03:29.679 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:03:32.709 --> 02:03:32.719 align:start position:0%
DHHS them providing a a separate report
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
on this fund These funds particularly is
 
02:03:37.270 --> 02:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
important now could that be merged into
 
02:03:40.350 --> 02:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
the report with alcohol can be but I
 
02:03:43.310 --> 02:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
think it's different Revenue sources so
 
02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:44.270 align:start position:0%
think it's different Revenue sources so
I

02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
don't I'm not sure we want to eliminate
 
02:03:49.310 --> 02:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
it have a separate report any have any
 
02:03:54.189 --> 02:03:54.199 align:start position:0%
opinion on that the TP typically what
 
02:03:57.229 --> 02:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
what happens within I I can be corrected
 
02:03:58.549 --> 02:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
if anybody else but typically what
 
02:04:00.510 --> 02:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
happens with the commission with alcohol
 
02:04:04.629 --> 02:04:04.639 align:start position:0%
and Other Drugs is that allocations on
 
02:04:06.430 --> 02:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
the number five during the Contracting
 
02:04:10.189 --> 02:04:10.199 align:start position:0%
process HHS will will ensure that all
 
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
these things happen when they
 
02:04:14.830 --> 02:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
contract okay so we want to leave it
 
02:04:16.589 --> 02:04:16.599 align:start position:0%
with DHHS for the
 
02:04:19.790 --> 02:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
reporting I I believe so yes okay that's
 
02:04:22.510 --> 02:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
fine I don't want to put words in Amo
 
02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
but they typically do this during the
 
02:04:25.990 --> 02:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
Contracting process anyone else any have
 
02:04:28.750 --> 02:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
any objection to leaving the report
 
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:37.950 --> 02:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
DHHS on page three it talks about uh
 
02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
lines six to nine this is actually a
 
02:04:42.990 --> 02:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
problem this is a problem in existing
 
02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
legislation where you know a valid
 
02:04:46.990 --> 02:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
passport you know the Bold is would be
 
02:04:48.549 --> 02:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
added but it's by by a country with whom
 
02:04:50.830 --> 02:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
the United States maintains diplomatic
 
02:04:52.830 --> 02:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
relations it was always believed that
 
02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
was a drafting era that United States
 
02:04:57.549 --> 02:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
passport wasn't the an appropriate form
 
02:04:59.229 --> 02:04:59.239 align:start position:0%
of identification for alcohol they've
 
02:05:00.629 --> 02:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
been attempting to fix it in every
 
02:05:02.709 --> 02:05:02.719 align:start position:0%
cannabis bill not a standalone here it
 
02:05:06.350 --> 02:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
is again but it would be no explanation
 
02:05:07.990 --> 02:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
why you can accept a passport from
 
02:05:09.750 --> 02:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
Ireland or England but not a United
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
States passport in America but that's
 
02:05:14.910 --> 02:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
how the law is written so but does
 
02:05:16.669 --> 02:05:16.679 align:start position:0%
anyone have any problem with the United
 
02:05:20.229 --> 02:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
States passport being as fish form of
 
02:05:22.830 --> 02:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
identification purchase liquor and
 
02:05:27.390 --> 02:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
matter lines 11 through 17
 
02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
um I will say before we get into the
 
02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
policy of the uh the forfeiture
 
02:05:42.149 --> 02:05:42.159 align:start position:0%
fund this has been a hot that has been a
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
separate Hot Topic issue in the
 
02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
legislator and perhaps i' striking that
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
out for the time being and not dealing
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
with the drug forfeiture is issue you
 
02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
will that can sync sync the ship if you
 
02:05:59.589 --> 02:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
know what I
 
02:06:01.950 --> 02:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
mean does anyone have any objection with
 
02:06:05.109 --> 02:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
that your your your recommendation is to
 
02:06:08.629 --> 02:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
strike section five starting on line 11
 
02:06:11.109 --> 02:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
yes support that and I'm not commenting
 
02:06:13.109 --> 02:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
on the policy either way I'm just
 
02:06:15.510 --> 02:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
explaining that that
 
02:06:19.229 --> 02:06:19.239 align:start position:0%
policy is is worthy of its own B
 
02:06:20.870 --> 02:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
separate aside from this I don't anyone
 
02:06:23.549 --> 02:06:23.559 align:start position:0%
has any disagreement with that or so
 
02:06:23.559 --> 02:06:25.390 align:start position:0%
has any disagreement with that or so
eliminate

02:06:25.390 --> 02:06:25.400 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
02:06:27.470 --> 02:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
forfeiture well not eliminating it's
 
02:06:34.430 --> 02:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:36.270 --> 02:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
the we
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:47.599 --> 02:06:52.830 align:start position:0%
 
good

02:06:52.830 --> 02:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:57.910 --> 02:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
on lines uh 19 through 20 uh 23 any
 
02:07:15.709 --> 02:07:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:17.709 --> 02:07:17.719 align:start position:0%
added I think they might have left out
 
02:07:20.430 --> 02:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
the word harvesting or cultivating
 
02:07:25.790 --> 02:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:28.390 --> 02:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
it it's
 
02:07:30.990 --> 02:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
just cultivation enough or we need to
 
02:07:40.229 --> 02:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:42.350 --> 02:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
harvesting we're fairly confident the
 
02:07:43.390 --> 02:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
same thing but you never know when it
 
02:07:46.669 --> 02:07:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
just add the word cultivation after
 
02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:57.679 align:start position:0%
cultivation and harvesting we
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:19.149 align:start position:0%
 
two

02:08:19.149 --> 02:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
okay now we're in the uh definition
 
02:08:24.189 --> 02:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
section it starts
 
02:08:33.709 --> 02:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
31 question sure if this should become
 
02:08:40.669 --> 02:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
law even
 
02:08:40.679 --> 02:08:47.149 align:start position:0%
law even
need

02:08:47.149 --> 02:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:51.870 --> 02:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:54.069 --> 02:08:54.079 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry what was the question
 
02:08:56.549 --> 02:08:56.559 align:start position:0%
again Chief well uh if if the
 
02:08:59.030 --> 02:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
legalization becomes law do we actually
 
02:09:00.870 --> 02:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
need alternative uh treatment centers
 
02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:03.229 align:start position:0%
need alternative uh treatment centers
any

02:09:03.229 --> 02:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:05.669 --> 02:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
longer yeah so
 
02:09:07.790 --> 02:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
again I don't necessarily think we need
 
02:09:09.149 --> 02:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
the definition because we're only
 
02:09:10.990 --> 02:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
referencing another definition in you
 
02:09:13.790 --> 02:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
know in in law anyway so I'm not sure
 
02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
that it serves any purpose so it it may
 
02:09:19.790 --> 02:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
if someone's looking for the definition
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
within the statute they can go to the
 
02:09:23.390 --> 02:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
definition section oh and find where
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's def what what is the definition so
 
02:09:26.950 --> 02:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think it hurts having it in
 
02:09:28.709 --> 02:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
there although I do think that it we're
 
02:09:30.109 --> 02:09:30.119 align:start position:0%
still going to have medical dispensaries
 
02:09:32.109 --> 02:09:32.119 align:start position:0%
and alternative treatment centers so I
 
02:09:34.030 --> 02:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
think we leave we leave it in for that
 
02:09:36.589 --> 02:09:36.599 align:start position:0%
reason that's exactly correct because if
 
02:09:38.669 --> 02:09:38.679 align:start position:0%
you have a reference to it in the law
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
you have to Define it in the law yes
 
02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:44.990 align:start position:0%
you have to Define it in the law yes
he's

02:09:44.990 --> 02:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.350 --> 02:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
corre he's two in he's two in a row he's
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:54.549 --> 02:09:54.559 align:start position:0%
all right so we can leave the the
 
02:10:00.549 --> 02:10:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:04.430 --> 02:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
35 I wanted to make sure that we're not
 
02:10:08.589 --> 02:10:08.599 align:start position:0%
this is not regulating CBD extract and
 
02:10:09.330 --> 02:10:09.340 align:start position:0%
that's its
 
02:10:09.340 --> 02:10:10.629 align:start position:0%
that's its
[Music]

02:10:10.629 --> 02:10:10.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:10:14.270 --> 02:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
own that's it own own right now you can
 
02:10:16.549 --> 02:10:16.559 align:start position:0%
buy that in a lot
 
02:10:18.589 --> 02:10:18.599 align:start position:0%
of you can buy that in aot different
 
02:10:20.310 --> 02:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
stores right now without a
 
02:10:21.990 --> 02:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
license you know we don't want to
 
02:10:23.390 --> 02:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
require a license for just someone
 
02:10:24.709 --> 02:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
buying CBD
 
02:10:27.669 --> 02:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
oil do do we want to put that
 
02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
phraseology in there does not
 
02:10:32.589 --> 02:10:32.599 align:start position:0%
include blob
 
02:10:35.470 --> 02:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
blob I I agree with representative ol
 
02:10:37.069 --> 02:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
you know we have we have to make sure we
 
02:10:38.910 --> 02:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
protect those stores that are selling
 
02:10:40.709 --> 02:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
selling the stuff at like spas and stuff
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
like that and uh you know there's creams
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
being being sold that are they're
 
02:10:46.950 --> 02:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
important to people
 
02:10:49.589 --> 02:10:49.599 align:start position:0%
so is this definition accomplished that
 
02:10:50.950 --> 02:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
as it's
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:10.709 --> 02:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
but seems like it might be helpful to be
 
02:11:13.950 --> 02:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
more specific
 
02:11:17.830 --> 02:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
just say that this excludes CBD only
 
02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:20.990 align:start position:0%
just say that this excludes CBD only
product

02:11:20.990 --> 02:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
yeah that could be included in the last
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
sentence you know or other product such
 
02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
as CBD oils or CBD products derivatives
 
02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
derivatives derivatives so I will Mr
 
02:11:36.109 --> 02:11:36.119 align:start position:0%
chair I think you and I had a brief
 
02:11:37.870 --> 02:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
conversation about this or I sent you
 
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
some emails on it anyway CBD is going to
 
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
be an interesting conversation point
 
02:11:44.470 --> 02:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
right now um because it's being pushed
 
02:11:46.510 --> 02:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
in a lot of places and now we have
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
conflicting law happening um the city of
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
Rochester shut down a CBD coffee shop
 
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
because technically according to the FDA
 
02:11:56.109 --> 02:11:56.119 align:start position:0%
CBD Is Not An approved approved product
 
02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
for the inclusion in into a food product
 
02:12:01.470 --> 02:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
and so that's creating some
 
02:12:04.470 --> 02:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
some spot enforcement for lack of
 
02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
metaphrase um that's going on and never
 
02:12:09.709 --> 02:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
mind I I I just came back from uh Las
 
02:12:11.470 --> 02:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
Vegas and I attended the National Beer
 
02:12:14.910 --> 02:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
wholesalers Association CBD drinks
 
02:12:16.750 --> 02:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
whether alcoholic or non-alcoholic are
 
02:12:18.629 --> 02:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
starting to become all AR R and Estates
 
02:12:20.270 --> 02:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
that are not regulating and dealing with
 
02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
this issue of CBD and THC infused other
 
02:12:25.669 --> 02:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
products that may be food or otherwise
 
02:12:28.510 --> 02:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
so again I I I I just caution that by
 
02:12:30.390 --> 02:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
not taking a stance we're
 
02:12:33.189 --> 02:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
leaving conflict out there um that's
 
02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
pending so they shut down the coffee
 
02:12:38.069 --> 02:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
shop serving the food that won't make
 
02:12:39.709 --> 02:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
you impaired but if you buy it in a
 
02:12:41.109 --> 02:12:41.119 align:start position:0%
candy bar that will make you impaired
 
02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's fine I'm just making a statement
 
02:12:46.189 --> 02:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
that that again we have this conflict of
 
02:12:48.270 --> 02:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
of CBD and a hemp deriv product that
 
02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
that people conflate with THC and low
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
low potency THC products and what does
 
02:12:56.109 --> 02:12:56.119 align:start position:0%
that mean we definitely have to protect
 
02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
the spas that are selling creams and
 
02:13:00.149 --> 02:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
stuff like that I mean that's CBD yes
 
02:13:01.549 --> 02:13:01.559 align:start position:0%
but they're not they're not ingesting
 
02:13:05.149 --> 02:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
that so I'm sorry that's like not a food
 
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
and is there we have a doctor on the are
 
02:13:12.189 --> 02:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
you aware of any different effects of
 
02:13:14.910 --> 02:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
CBD benef health benefits if it's
 
02:13:17.470 --> 02:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
ingested as opposed to using whatever
 
02:13:18.709 --> 02:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
you just
 
02:13:20.149 --> 02:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
does it matter does that really M I'm
 
02:13:22.589 --> 02:13:22.599 align:start position:0%
just do we really seems that we're over
 
02:13:24.950 --> 02:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
regulating that if there's no yeah I
 
02:13:26.310 --> 02:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
mean I I think that the only thing that
 
02:13:28.430 --> 02:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
I would say is if we're adjusting it
 
02:13:30.830 --> 02:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
like it was brought up by by some of the
 
02:13:32.669 --> 02:13:32.679 align:start position:0%
presenters today is that there a lot of
 
02:13:34.750 --> 02:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
the products says it's un regulated do
 
02:13:36.709 --> 02:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
have THC in them and that gets a little
 
02:13:38.910 --> 02:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
bit tricky like if you test what's out
 
02:13:43.510 --> 02:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
there like at the co-op um you know like
 
02:13:46.149 --> 02:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
10 to 20% of those products do have THC
 
02:13:47.830 --> 02:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
or would show up positive on a drug test
 
02:13:48.830 --> 02:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
which which makes that a little
 
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
complicated I think when you're
 
02:13:53.149 --> 02:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
ingesting it um but yes I mean so just
 
02:13:55.390 --> 02:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
the product I mean different vectors are
 
02:13:57.229 --> 02:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
absorbed differently so a topical would
 
02:13:59.310 --> 02:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
be absorbed differently than a than an
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
oral tincture or something like that so
 
02:14:04.669 --> 02:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
I think it is different uh doesn't
 
02:14:07.709 --> 02:14:07.719 align:start position:0%
matter I I don't I don't know but but it
 
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:14.870 --> 02:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
differently I suppose what we can tackle
 
02:14:17.149 --> 02:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
that inconsistency at a different time
 
02:14:19.350 --> 02:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
seems to me that
 
02:14:21.470 --> 02:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
but we want to keep those products that
 
02:14:23.470 --> 02:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
are being sold
 
02:14:26.790 --> 02:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
now continue to be sold as they are um
 
02:14:28.629 --> 02:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
is there I know our friends from one of
 
02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
our friends from Maine is here he's at
 
02:14:32.870 --> 02:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
my 12 o'clock is have you seen the
 
02:14:35.549 --> 02:14:35.559 align:start position:0%
definition that we're
 
02:14:38.350 --> 02:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
referencing have you have you do you
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:48.549 align:start position:0%
 
referencing

02:14:48.549 --> 02:14:48.559 align:start position:0%
referencing
 
02:14:50.310 --> 02:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
does someone have a copy we can just I'm
 
02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you can offer any
 
02:14:55.149 --> 02:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
comment on that particular definition if
 
02:14:56.830 --> 02:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
there's any problems
 
02:14:59.270 --> 02:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
with M Mr
 
02:15:01.189 --> 02:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
CH the
 
02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
the paragraph two Roman two it talks
 
02:15:08.109 --> 02:15:08.119 align:start position:0%
about topical or oral
 
02:15:10.990 --> 02:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
administrations now it does not talk
 
02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
about food products food products is a
 
02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:14.629 align:start position:0%
about food products food products is a
different

02:15:14.629 --> 02:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:15:17.310 --> 02:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
category and the store in Rochester was
 
02:15:20.109 --> 02:15:20.119 align:start position:0%
manufact facturing or selling a food
 
02:15:21.390 --> 02:15:21.400 align:start position:0%
product that
 
02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:23.229 align:start position:0%
product that
was

02:15:23.229 --> 02:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:15:26.669 --> 02:15:26.679 align:start position:0%
contaminated by CBD
 
02:15:29.390 --> 02:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
oil so it was a contaminated food
 
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
product that's a different section Al
 
02:15:37.229 --> 02:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
together uh regarding law
 
02:15:40.109 --> 02:15:40.119 align:start position:0%
again that's outside the area what we
 
02:15:44.629 --> 02:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
have currently being sold are
 
02:15:44.639 --> 02:15:46.229 align:start position:0%
have currently being sold are
CBD

02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
CBD
 
02:15:49.589 --> 02:15:49.599 align:start position:0%
um products direct
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
products those products are
 
02:15:55.030 --> 02:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
not uh what's the word
 
02:15:58.189 --> 02:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
for well they are topical and they are
 
02:16:01.390 --> 02:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
oral but they're not food products so
 
02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:04.030 align:start position:0%
oral but they're not food products so
they're

02:16:04.030 --> 02:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:07.310 --> 02:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
not they ain't
 
02:16:10.350 --> 02:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
food so if we want to put food in there
 
02:16:12.470 --> 02:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
someplace that just gets rid of that
 
02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:14.589 align:start position:0%
someplace that just gets rid of that
issue

02:16:14.589 --> 02:16:14.599 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:16:18.830 --> 02:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
entirely H how there's a federal
 
02:16:20.470 --> 02:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman how would that account for
 
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
like what we're talking about with the
 
02:16:23.790 --> 02:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
coffee like I know the coffee shop in my
 
02:16:26.189 --> 02:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
town puts the CBD if you order that in
 
02:16:28.430 --> 02:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
the coffee but it's that's it's because
 
02:16:30.510 --> 02:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
they're separate items you want getting
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
shut down be careful I I say say where I
 
02:16:33.519 --> 02:16:35.669 align:start position:0%
shut down be careful I I say say where I
live

02:16:35.669 --> 02:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
live
 
02:16:39.509 --> 02:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
set um but right so like if they're
 
02:16:40.830 --> 02:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
separate products but it's being
 
02:16:42.709 --> 02:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
introduced into another product as
 
02:16:45.669 --> 02:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
opposed to like a like ready for
 
02:16:51.150 --> 02:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:53.469 --> 02:16:53.479 align:start position:0%
so I again there's a federal definition
 
02:16:55.549 --> 02:16:55.559 align:start position:0%
of cannabis if anybody wants to hear
 
02:16:57.629 --> 02:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
that but I don't know where we want to
 
02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
look at other states definitions and
 
02:17:02.349 --> 02:17:02.359 align:start position:0%
come back to this discussion so C CBD
 
02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
oil product everything is legal you can
 
02:17:07.469 --> 02:17:07.479 align:start position:0%
buy it right now at all variety of
 
02:17:09.870 --> 02:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
different types of stores all right or
 
02:17:13.589 --> 02:17:13.599 align:start position:0%
businesses we don't want to change that
 
02:17:15.990 --> 02:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
no one's getting impaired from CBD if
 
02:17:18.469 --> 02:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
it's just CBD so I want to make sure
 
02:17:21.469 --> 02:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
that this definition does not disrupt
 
02:17:24.990 --> 02:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
the what's existing now well but I if I
 
02:17:27.950 --> 02:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
may what I heard from the doctor is that
 
02:17:31.629 --> 02:17:31.639 align:start position:0%
um things that are things that say they
 
02:17:34.110 --> 02:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
have CBD in it are testing with levels
 
02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
of THC as well is that what you said
 
02:17:38.870 --> 02:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
yeah that's correct that's what the data
 
02:17:39.990 --> 02:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
shows and that's what they presented
 
02:17:41.709 --> 02:17:41.719 align:start position:0%
today is that there are even if it's
 
02:17:43.509 --> 02:17:43.519 align:start position:0%
labeled as something that you can buy at
 
02:17:46.230 --> 02:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
the co-op as CBD only product a
 
02:17:51.830 --> 02:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:55.349 --> 02:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
THC Now by testing positive do you mean
 
02:17:57.709 --> 02:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
the traces of it or is it something that
 
02:18:00.070 --> 02:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
would you would actually make if it's %
 
02:18:02.469 --> 02:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
or less it's not considered
 
02:18:08.110 --> 02:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
Canabis okay so so that's that's why um
 
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
the law the law here our consensus is we
 
02:18:13.629 --> 02:18:13.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:18.469 --> 02:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
at some of that to be integrated into
 
02:18:20.589 --> 02:18:20.599 align:start position:0%
okay and the other thing is seeds and
 
02:18:23.469 --> 02:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
the defition of cannabis the DEA said
 
02:18:29.190 --> 02:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
not so but then wouldn't if if that's
 
02:18:34.389 --> 02:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
the case wouldn't seeds then be
 
02:18:41.469 --> 02:18:41.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:41.479 --> 02:18:45.150 align:start position:0%
 
are

02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:48.309 --> 02:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
so uh so what we what I would safe when
 
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
it comes to perhaps
 
02:18:51.870 --> 02:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement if you're going to be
 
02:18:54.589 --> 02:18:54.599 align:start position:0%
tracking the seeds I don't see the sale
 
02:18:58.030 --> 02:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
uh would that defin we need to keep that
 
02:19:00.750 --> 02:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
language where seeds in there i' rather
 
02:19:02.990 --> 02:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
keep it in and take it out later than
 
02:19:05.349 --> 02:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
take it out now and wish we kept it in
 
02:19:07.509 --> 02:19:07.519 align:start position:0%
my my but I'm not
 
02:19:11.429 --> 02:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
sure I'm not sure I'm correct in doing
 
02:19:13.589 --> 02:19:13.599 align:start position:0%
that I think that that would be the
 
02:19:15.709 --> 02:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
safest way to do it in the majority of
 
02:19:18.309 --> 02:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
the the finite definition of what we're
 
02:19:32.309 --> 02:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:35.589 --> 02:19:35.599 align:start position:0%
rule so in respect to this paragraph
 
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
that we been is there any changes though
 
02:19:40.150 --> 02:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
that we think should be made to
 
02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
it I know there's suggestion of striking
 
02:19:44.429 --> 02:19:44.439 align:start position:0%
the word seeds but is there does anyone
 
02:19:46.309 --> 02:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
have any comment on whether we should do
 
02:19:49.830 --> 02:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:51.630 --> 02:19:51.640 align:start position:0%
I I it feels like this is a larger I
 
02:19:53.990 --> 02:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
mean we could spend the however long it
 
02:19:55.630 --> 02:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
feels like we need to come back to this
 
02:19:57.550 --> 02:19:57.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know if what what the chair's
 
02:20:00.870 --> 02:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
intention is of you know um if you want
 
02:20:02.670 --> 02:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
to revisit let's say we agree to keep it
 
02:20:05.230 --> 02:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
in and then next meeting you say oh
 
02:20:06.750 --> 02:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
here's the information let's take it out
 
02:20:08.710 --> 02:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
this is not set in stone it just if we
 
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
come to a consensus on something you
 
02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
know in I think the public can here are
 
02:20:15.230 --> 02:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
reasoning there's a lot of uh interest
 
02:20:16.309 --> 02:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
people interested in what we're doing
 
02:20:18.429 --> 02:20:18.439 align:start position:0%
one way or another but it's not like
 
02:20:23.870 --> 02:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:26.030 --> 02:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
anything I say we leave it in for now
 
02:20:27.630 --> 02:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
and if we want to discuss taking it out
 
02:20:30.190 --> 02:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
the next meeting you
 
02:20:32.990 --> 02:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
canil yeah I mean my whole point in like
 
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
saying what I was saying was that I know
 
02:20:37.150 --> 02:20:37.160 align:start position:0%
lots of spa owners that sell sell creams
 
02:20:38.510 --> 02:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to see them their
 
02:20:40.230 --> 02:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
businesses hurt I want to see them still
 
02:20:42.950 --> 02:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
be able to sell their creams and perhaps
 
02:20:45.030 --> 02:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh if we can have some suggestive
 
02:20:48.070 --> 02:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
language on to make sure we're not
 
02:20:50.270 --> 02:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
inadvertently making some lawful
 
02:20:51.990 --> 02:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
businesses that are operating lawfully
 
02:20:54.349 --> 02:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
right now require licenses to make sure
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
we don't mess that
 
02:21:00.270 --> 02:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
up in regards to accessories any issues
 
02:21:06.429 --> 02:21:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:08.389 --> 02:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
there Mr
 
02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
chairman sorry sorry to take us back um
 
02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to look up one section this
 
02:21:16.990 --> 02:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
is on line 22 on page three back to the
 
02:21:19.510 --> 02:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
de definition of illegal drug and so I
 
02:21:22.510 --> 02:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
just looked up 318 B2 which is includes
 
02:21:25.830 --> 02:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
the acts prohibited and so our list of
 
02:21:27.510 --> 02:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
exceptions possession use manufacturer
 
02:21:30.110 --> 02:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
sale is not fully inclusive of all the
 
02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
things here like they have um have under
 
02:21:35.950 --> 02:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
their control possessed with intent to
 
02:21:36.990 --> 02:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
sell like I'm wondering if we should
 
02:21:39.190 --> 02:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
just mirror the language to make sure
 
02:21:42.110 --> 02:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
that all the exceptions are in
 
02:21:45.510 --> 02:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
there that that makes sense no I agree
 
02:21:47.830 --> 02:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
we want to have consistency so
 
02:21:49.230 --> 02:21:49.240 align:start position:0%
so sorry to bring us back I just didn't
 
02:21:56.270 --> 02:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:59.870 --> 02:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
away now wouldn't we want to just kind
 
02:22:02.750 --> 02:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
of what we did with um first definition
 
02:22:04.710 --> 02:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
of definition of alternative treatment
 
02:22:07.469 --> 02:22:07.479 align:start position:0%
centers we reference the RSA and then we
 
02:22:09.670 --> 02:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
can cut and past that same
 
02:22:13.389 --> 02:22:13.399 align:start position:0%
language does that make sense and what's
 
02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
what's the what's the RSA you were
 
02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:34.590 align:start position:0%
what's the what's the RSA you were
referencing

02:22:34.590 --> 02:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:36.710 --> 02:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
any problem with that from anyone any
 
02:22:38.710 --> 02:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
objection I think it makes the language
 
02:22:42.150 --> 02:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:45.030 --> 02:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you in respect to accessories
 
02:23:11.150 --> 02:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:14.309 --> 02:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman just one quick comment and
 
02:23:16.550 --> 02:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure this is the correct
 
02:23:19.070 --> 02:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
place to put it in but we have to make
 
02:23:22.870 --> 02:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
sure that we have a lot of uh businesses
 
02:23:25.710 --> 02:23:25.720 align:start position:0%
out there now that are selling
 
02:23:30.630 --> 02:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
accessories that are not uh not going to
 
02:23:32.990 --> 02:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
be levied the
 
02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.429 align:start position:0%
be levied the
15%

02:23:35.429 --> 02:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
15%
 
02:23:37.910 --> 02:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh percentage that the The Liquor
 
02:23:40.389 --> 02:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
Commission will ask for so I think what
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
we would want to do when we have when
 
02:23:46.349 --> 02:23:46.359 align:start position:0%
and if we have our Outlets we want to
 
02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
make sure that the revenues from the
 
02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
accessories are not put into the to the
 
02:23:55.269 --> 02:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
taxed portion of the revenue because I
 
02:23:58.429 --> 02:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
think it would then be unfair to have
 
02:24:01.070 --> 02:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
some people taxed on selling accessories
 
02:24:03.389 --> 02:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
and others that are
 
02:24:05.630 --> 02:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
not so I think that we would want to
 
02:24:08.389 --> 02:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
make sure that the accessories in the
 
02:24:11.950 --> 02:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
outlets when and if the language is pass
 
02:24:15.309 --> 02:24:15.319 align:start position:0%
are exempt from the
 
02:24:19.950 --> 02:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:22.670 --> 02:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
fee other than that you'd have some
 
02:24:24.550 --> 02:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
businesses in the state that are selling
 
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
those products that aren't being taxed
 
02:24:29.110 --> 02:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
and some that
 
02:24:32.269 --> 02:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
are anyone have any comment on
 
02:24:34.630 --> 02:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
that I would agree with my colleague
 
02:24:37.110 --> 02:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
that that would create an unfair um
 
02:24:38.990 --> 02:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
burden upon businesses that are already
 
02:24:41.190 --> 02:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
selling those
 
02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
items so so I
 
02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
think if you're let's just say you're
 
02:24:48.469 --> 02:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
selling you know the the whatever pipes
 
02:24:50.110 --> 02:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
and whatever that that's you want to
 
02:24:51.510 --> 02:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
call that storm
 
02:24:54.190 --> 02:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
right they they wouldn't be subject to
 
02:24:56.510 --> 02:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
any franchise Fe so I guess the question
 
02:24:59.590 --> 02:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
is if if a franchisee inside their store
 
02:25:00.710 --> 02:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
elected to
 
02:25:03.150 --> 02:25:03.160 align:start position:0%
sell the pipes or what whatever the
 
02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia is would the stuff sold
 
02:25:08.950 --> 02:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
inside the franchise store be subject to
 
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
the 15% royalty it shouldn't be I
 
02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
agree it's just it's simply drawer one
 
02:25:19.269 --> 02:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
and draw too in your POS system so if
 
02:25:21.950 --> 02:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
you're selling paraphernalia items it's
 
02:25:24.990 --> 02:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
not being taxed on the grand sale of
 
02:25:28.070 --> 02:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
your retail you're just the Cannabis
 
02:25:30.590 --> 02:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
items are being taxed other than that
 
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
you're creating an unfair Advantage for
 
02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
the businesses that are in place now or
 
02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
a disadvantage if you now choose to tax
 
02:25:43.870 --> 02:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
them or Levy the franchise fee with
 
02:25:47.190 --> 02:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
them Mr chairman do we know know how
 
02:25:48.750 --> 02:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
other states are doing that like does
 
02:25:51.710 --> 02:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts tax uh paraphernalia
 
02:25:55.950 --> 02:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:59.110 --> 02:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
that sorry repeat that I was just was
 
02:26:01.469 --> 02:26:01.479 align:start position:0%
wondering how other states were handling
 
02:26:03.990 --> 02:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia sold in their stores do we
 
02:26:06.670 --> 02:26:06.680 align:start position:0%
know if they're imposing higher tax
 
02:26:09.230 --> 02:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
burdens well
 
02:26:11.630 --> 02:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
it I don't know what every State's doing
 
02:26:13.230 --> 02:26:13.240 align:start position:0%
some states just have a general retail
 
02:26:18.030 --> 02:26:18.040 align:start position:0%
sales tax my my thought was
 
02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
the franchisee if you choose to buy your
 
02:26:22.070 --> 02:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia from there you're already
 
02:26:25.230 --> 02:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
there it's the choice of the consumer it
 
02:26:27.230 --> 02:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
might be cheaper to go to another store
 
02:26:28.670 --> 02:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
but I don't think the retail stores are
 
02:26:31.269 --> 02:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
relying on their par parapan Alia cells
 
02:26:32.550 --> 02:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
as their big money
 
02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:34.190 align:start position:0%
as their big money
maker

02:26:34.190 --> 02:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
maker
 
02:26:40.670 --> 02:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:42.710 --> 02:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
are come come to the microphone if you
 
02:26:44.469 --> 02:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
don't mind just introduce yourself and
 
02:26:44.479 --> 02:26:45.550 align:start position:0%
don't mind just introduce yourself and
the

02:26:45.550 --> 02:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:26:49.190 --> 02:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:54.990 --> 02:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
well hello uh in in in in in oh in Maine
 
02:26:57.150 --> 02:26:57.160 align:start position:0%
right in our stores we sell clothing and
 
02:26:59.150 --> 02:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
we do sell some paraphernalia although
 
02:27:00.630 --> 02:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
it's not a big thing it's more of a
 
02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
convenience thing we charge main sales
 
02:27:07.349 --> 02:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
tax on on any cannabis product but we do
 
02:27:10.110 --> 02:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
not CH charge main sales tax on any
 
02:27:13.389 --> 02:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia any clothing and I believe
 
02:27:16.269 --> 02:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
CBD products if it's just CBD but isn't
 
02:27:18.630 --> 02:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
there a General like retail sales tax
 
02:27:20.830 --> 02:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
10% so wouldn't that apply to the
 
02:27:23.469 --> 02:27:23.479 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia uh it's it doesn't apply
 
02:27:25.269 --> 02:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
to the if you come up to the counter and
 
02:27:26.910 --> 02:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
you're buying from us and you have a
 
02:27:29.110 --> 02:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
shirt you don't pay tax on the shirt but
 
02:27:31.230 --> 02:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
if you if you buy flow you pay tax on
 
02:27:32.990 --> 02:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
the flow so we tax them on the flower
 
02:27:34.830 --> 02:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
but not on the shirt but take cannabis
 
02:27:36.469 --> 02:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
out of it you go you go to a you know
 
02:27:39.389 --> 02:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
any type of retail store isn't there a
 
02:27:42.429 --> 02:27:42.439 align:start position:0%
broad-based sales tax oh okay yeah yes
 
02:27:44.870 --> 02:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
the main sales tax I think is 6% so they
 
02:27:46.349 --> 02:27:46.359 align:start position:0%
would pay but there's but the Cannabis
 
02:27:48.349 --> 02:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
tax is not applied to it the Cannabis
 
02:27:50.429 --> 02:27:50.439 align:start position:0%
tax but this the broad-based sales tax
 
02:27:52.150 --> 02:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
would be applied correct if you have a
 
02:27:53.429 --> 02:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
well New Hampshire doesn't have one but
 
02:27:55.790 --> 02:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
in Maine yeah we charge 6% on top of
 
02:27:58.469 --> 02:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
that but in Maine we charge 10% on
 
02:28:01.030 --> 02:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis and then 6% the general sales
 
02:28:02.910 --> 02:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
tax that's how it
 
02:28:06.870 --> 02:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
works if I could uh just a two quick
 
02:28:10.389 --> 02:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
comments Jim Riddle again um on your
 
02:28:12.349 --> 02:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
definition I do believe I don't have it
 
02:28:13.870 --> 02:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
in front of me but you include the word
 
02:28:15.630 --> 02:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
license in that definition of
 
02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:18.070 align:start position:0%
license in that definition of
accessories

02:28:18.070 --> 02:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
accessories
 
02:28:21.710 --> 02:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
and currently stores sell accessories
 
02:28:24.950 --> 02:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
without having to be licensed so I don't
 
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
know if that's an inadvertent inclusion
 
02:28:30.590 --> 02:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
of a word or if you're thinking of
 
02:28:33.269 --> 02:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
considering an entire paraphernalia
 
02:28:33.279 --> 02:28:35.150 align:start position:0%
considering an entire paraphernalia
licensing

02:28:35.150 --> 02:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
02:28:38.630 --> 02:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
system so Mr chair if I may is it is
 
02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
that correct the it does currently say
 
02:28:44.510 --> 02:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
licens again to try to I tend to agree
 
02:28:46.950 --> 02:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
with the fact that um we shouldn't be
 
02:28:50.349 --> 02:28:50.359 align:start position:0%
charging a tax on on the on the produ on
 
02:28:53.630 --> 02:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
the non cannabis products and so I think
 
02:28:55.550 --> 02:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
number four I I didn't see anywhere we
 
02:28:57.790 --> 02:28:57.800 align:start position:0%
actually have a license for a cannabis
 
02:28:59.790 --> 02:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
accessory reseller anywhere in the bill
 
02:29:01.269 --> 02:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
so I think that number four is probably
 
02:29:03.389 --> 02:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
a leftover from somewhere else that did
 
02:29:04.990 --> 02:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
have it so I think we should strike
 
02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
number four and under I'm G to Jump
 
02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
Ahead real
 
02:29:10.830 --> 02:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
quick when it comes to striking number
 
02:29:13.469 --> 02:29:13.479 align:start position:0%
four are we all okay with
 
02:29:15.950 --> 02:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
that or anyone have any I'm not saying
 
02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
you approve of BS but just or would be
 
02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis accessory retail retailer means
 
02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
an entity licensed to sell cannabis
 
02:29:25.429 --> 02:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
accessories and paraphernalia yeah we
 
02:29:26.870 --> 02:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
don't have a license for that anyway so
 
02:29:30.309 --> 02:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter so that's my point and
 
02:29:32.910 --> 02:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
then just one final thing um on the
 
02:29:35.630 --> 02:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
question of seeds uh being in the
 
02:29:38.230 --> 02:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
definition of cannabis I will uh send to
 
02:29:40.750 --> 02:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
you the DEA determination letter where
 
02:29:43.349 --> 02:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
they specifically say seeds because they
 
02:29:46.110 --> 02:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
don't contain THC are hemp and not
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis us regardless of their genetic
 
02:29:50.590 --> 02:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
potential thank you the last thing I'd
 
02:29:51.750 --> 02:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
say Mr chair when it comes to this
 
02:29:55.030 --> 02:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
taxation this question is I'm going to
 
02:29:57.389 --> 02:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
jump ahead real quick to page 18 where
 
02:29:59.630 --> 02:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
we talk about Taxation and I think we
 
02:30:02.230 --> 02:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
can just fix this by adding um the
 
02:30:05.070 --> 02:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
franchise free on a uh sorry a franchise
 
02:30:07.630 --> 02:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
fee on a monthly total gross revenue
 
02:30:09.870 --> 02:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
less cannabis accessories and that
 
02:30:11.469 --> 02:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
solves the problem we're not taxing
 
02:30:13.510 --> 02:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
accessories at that point we're not we
 
02:30:15.150 --> 02:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
Define What accessories are but we're
 
02:30:16.790 --> 02:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
we're clearly saying that it's not a
 
02:30:19.349 --> 02:30:19.359 align:start position:0%
taxable event whether you're a licensed
 
02:30:21.710 --> 02:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
franchise or an individual that should
 
02:30:24.550 --> 02:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
solve that problem I to step up
 
02:30:27.349 --> 02:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
sure so do that make sense to everybody
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
so I made note We'll add that add that
 
02:30:31.910 --> 02:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
in but so we're going to strike section
 
02:30:34.990 --> 02:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
four we'll leave section three as it is
 
02:30:38.030 --> 02:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
and we strike in a future language that
 
02:30:39.670 --> 02:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
accessories are not going to be text
 
02:30:41.550 --> 02:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
yeah and use the same terms right
 
02:30:44.190 --> 02:30:44.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis ex yes yep use the same exact
 
02:30:46.510 --> 02:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
that definition of three will be used
 
02:30:48.469 --> 02:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
that that language in in the taxable
 
02:30:53.030 --> 02:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
language all right moving on to number
 
02:30:55.790 --> 02:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
five any question to discussion on
 
02:30:58.990 --> 02:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
number five um Mr Vice chair yes I'm
 
02:31:00.510 --> 02:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
wondering if
 
02:31:04.670 --> 02:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
um uh do we are we gonna is the plan to
 
02:31:06.750 --> 02:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
go through every definition or do we
 
02:31:09.309 --> 02:31:09.319 align:start position:0%
want to go like the folks have comments
 
02:31:10.990 --> 02:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
just step through and if nobody has any
 
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
common we quickly move past it right
 
02:31:15.469 --> 02:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
just to make sure we we address so no
 
02:31:17.550 --> 02:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
questions on number five no comments I
 
02:31:19.590 --> 02:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
have a question Mr chairman I'm sorry
 
02:31:21.790 --> 02:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
question yes Chief uh should we add uh
 
02:31:23.510 --> 02:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
in five and actually some of the
 
02:31:26.030 --> 02:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
subsequent paragraphs as well a lure
 
02:31:28.510 --> 02:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
itself uh for example cannabis
 
02:31:31.070 --> 02:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
facilitation uh cultivation facility or
 
02:31:33.269 --> 02:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
cultivation facility means in entity
 
02:31:35.309 --> 02:31:35.319 align:start position:0%
registered and add and licensed by the
 
02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire or are we just
 
02:31:38.550 --> 02:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
registering these
 
02:31:38.560 --> 02:31:40.230 align:start position:0%
registering these
uh

02:31:40.230 --> 02:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:31:43.590 --> 02:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
Endeavors so I think
 
02:31:46.349 --> 02:31:46.359 align:start position:0%
uh Mr mik we we talked those are light
 
02:31:48.150 --> 02:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
LIC entities anyway so we could just
 
02:31:50.269 --> 02:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
change register to the word license and
 
02:31:53.150 --> 02:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
be done with it and that clarifies it
 
02:31:54.950 --> 02:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
everybody okay with
 
02:31:57.870 --> 02:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
that thank you so on number five line
 
02:31:59.910 --> 02:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
eight at the end of that sentence we're
 
02:32:03.950 --> 02:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:06.870 --> 02:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
license any further discussion on
 
02:32:09.870 --> 02:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
five seeing on moving on the number six
 
02:32:09.880 --> 02:32:15.269 align:start position:0%
five seeing on moving on the number six
cannabis

02:32:15.269 --> 02:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:15.279 --> 02:32:17.389 align:start position:0%
 
establishment

02:32:17.389 --> 02:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
02:32:20.190 --> 02:32:20.200 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:32:22.670 --> 02:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
here once again just just for
 
02:32:25.110 --> 02:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
clarification do we need to be more
 
02:32:27.309 --> 02:32:27.319 align:start position:0%
specific and indicate that such
 
02:32:29.309 --> 02:32:29.319 align:start position:0%
establishments are licensed for example
 
02:32:31.790 --> 02:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
again uh canab cannabis establishment
 
02:32:34.150 --> 02:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
means any license to Hampshire cannabis
 
02:32:37.030 --> 02:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
cultivation facility Etc do we want to
 
02:32:39.550 --> 02:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
get that specific it it's included at
 
02:32:41.590 --> 02:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
the end of that definition and licensed
 
02:32:44.150 --> 02:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:46.269 --> 02:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
commission but that's referen to the
 
02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
last clause or any other type of
 
02:32:51.510 --> 02:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis business license and commission
 
02:32:55.110 --> 02:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
and license so that's just to that last
 
02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
Clause so the am Li authorized am
 
02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
license doesn't apply to the beginning
 
02:33:03.710 --> 02:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
of the sentence we could add the words
 
02:33:03.720 --> 02:33:05.070 align:start position:0%
of the sentence we could add the words
uh

02:33:05.070 --> 02:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:33:08.670 --> 02:33:08.680 align:start position:0%
including something like that including
 
02:33:15.150 --> 02:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:15.160 --> 02:33:17.030 align:start position:0%
 
mean

02:33:17.030 --> 02:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:33:18.790 --> 02:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
so here's what here's what I'm going to
 
02:33:20.150 --> 02:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
recommend so we don't have to do license
 
02:33:21.750 --> 02:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
license license through this whole thing
 
02:33:23.590 --> 02:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
for each one of these commas that are in
 
02:33:26.150 --> 02:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
here um so what how how do you feel
 
02:33:28.150 --> 02:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
about we just put a license establish I
 
02:33:30.830 --> 02:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
mean a cannabis established means a
 
02:33:33.910 --> 02:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
licensed and then I'll just number A B C
 
02:33:35.670 --> 02:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
D for each one of the facilities so it
 
02:33:36.950 --> 02:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
means that all of these things have to
 
02:33:38.510 --> 02:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
be licensed that are in there because it
 
02:33:40.389 --> 02:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
applies to all the sub paragraphs does
 
02:33:42.389 --> 02:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
that make sense and just break that down
 
02:33:44.510 --> 02:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
so it's clear that it has to be with
 
02:33:46.630 --> 02:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
discuss a cannabis establish in this
 
02:33:47.990 --> 02:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
chapter means anything anybody is
 
02:33:51.910 --> 02:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:55.510 --> 02:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
you and that clarifies
 
02:33:58.429 --> 02:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
that number seven cannabis product
 
02:34:00.870 --> 02:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility or or product
 
02:34:10.389 --> 02:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
definition and again I can do the ABCD
 
02:34:14.790 --> 02:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
if you want on this one as well because
 
02:34:16.230 --> 02:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
we do have a bunch of commas in there
 
02:34:19.469 --> 02:34:19.479 align:start position:0%
there and to to Senator Whitley's
 
02:34:22.030 --> 02:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
grammar police the license only apply to
 
02:34:24.389 --> 02:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
the first to the first comma if I don't
 
02:34:26.590 --> 02:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
put that if we don't modify I will say
 
02:34:28.190 --> 02:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
that it came up because I'm teaching
 
02:34:29.790 --> 02:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
statutory interpretation at the law
 
02:34:32.030 --> 02:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
school and that issue about you know
 
02:34:34.469 --> 02:34:34.479 align:start position:0%
what it applies to is deeply disgusted
 
02:34:35.870 --> 02:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
the the other lawyer in the room is
 
02:34:38.110 --> 02:34:38.120 align:start position:0%
nodding so we'll do the same thing we'll
 
02:34:40.110 --> 02:34:40.120 align:start position:0%
do an ABCD on that one to talk about
 
02:34:43.269 --> 02:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
each one of those you know license to a
 
02:34:46.070 --> 02:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
purchase cannabis B uh the Manu B to
 
02:34:49.030 --> 02:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
manufacture prepare package cannabis and
 
02:34:50.750 --> 02:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
see to sell blah blah blah we'll do a
 
02:34:52.469 --> 02:34:52.479 align:start position:0%
license a bullet point for each one of
 
02:34:54.349 --> 02:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
those after the word license just to
 
02:34:56.630 --> 02:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
make sure it's clarified that license
 
02:34:58.349 --> 02:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
means all of these things not just the
 
02:34:58.359 --> 02:34:59.469 align:start position:0%
means all of these things not just the
first

02:34:59.469 --> 02:34:59.479 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:35:03.110 --> 02:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
comma I missed the I had no idea just
 
02:35:03.120 --> 02:35:04.309 align:start position:0%
comma I missed the I had no idea just
say

02:35:04.309 --> 02:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:35:06.550 --> 02:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
yes what did anyone else say by my
 
02:35:08.269 --> 02:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
number doesn't
 
02:35:10.550 --> 02:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
matter so we're moving on to number
 
02:35:14.389 --> 02:35:14.399 align:start position:0%
eight um cannabis products all right
 
02:35:17.469 --> 02:35:17.479 align:start position:0%
so all right I'm I'm back page four line
 
02:35:20.150 --> 02:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
26 we're walking through the definitions
 
02:35:21.990 --> 02:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
each one you're doing a good job keep
 
02:35:25.389 --> 02:35:25.399 align:start position:0%
going so number eight Canabis products
 
02:35:28.030 --> 02:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
um any questions on
 
02:35:30.790 --> 02:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
those CBD
 
02:35:34.429 --> 02:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
there last still not
 
02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
include that way what you're doing is
 
02:35:37.630 --> 02:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
you're making
 
02:35:41.269 --> 02:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
it isn't CBD a cannabis extract am I
 
02:35:43.830 --> 02:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
wrong when I say that I I believe it is
 
02:35:46.710 --> 02:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
but we we have to definitely protect
 
02:35:48.269 --> 02:35:48.279 align:start position:0%
these already established businesses
 
02:35:50.510 --> 02:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
that that's why people in the I think
 
02:35:53.190 --> 02:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
the easiest way to do that is to
 
02:35:57.670 --> 02:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
um so what a cannabis extract is CBD oil
 
02:36:01.309 --> 02:36:01.319 align:start position:0%
we can say keep the word Canabis extract
 
02:36:03.790 --> 02:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
excluding so here's the interesting so
 
02:36:05.910 --> 02:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
they have right this where we get into a
 
02:36:08.550 --> 02:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
little detail about what a CBD and
 
02:36:10.110 --> 02:36:10.120 align:start position:0%
certain concentrations we heard the
 
02:36:12.630 --> 02:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
conversation ear talk about low potency
 
02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
um products under 0.0 under 3% right is
 
02:36:17.469 --> 02:36:17.479 align:start position:0%
low potency product and not considered
 
02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
to be cannabis for the purposes of a lot
 
02:36:22.230 --> 02:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
of other statutes um but above that
 
02:36:24.950 --> 02:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
threshold is considered to be um a
 
02:36:27.950 --> 02:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis product and so how we Define
 
02:36:29.550 --> 02:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
that might be interesting in here so if
 
02:36:31.349 --> 02:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
we want to talk about low potency and
 
02:36:33.510 --> 02:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
create a definition for that so that we
 
02:36:35.349 --> 02:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
can say that low potency products are or
 
02:36:38.389 --> 02:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
not regulated um I'm not sure how we
 
02:36:40.510 --> 02:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
want to deal with that but again the
 
02:36:43.269 --> 02:36:43.279 align:start position:0%
Delta 9 Delta 8 Delta 10 THC products
 
02:36:47.389 --> 02:36:47.399 align:start position:0%
that can be derived out of C CBD oil
 
02:36:49.550 --> 02:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
right through a chemical process and
 
02:36:52.190 --> 02:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
have potency within a CBD product that
 
02:36:57.750 --> 02:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:00.790 --> 02:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
problematic so there's a gentleman in
 
02:37:02.590 --> 02:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
the audience that wants to speak and
 
02:37:07.590 --> 02:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:10.190 --> 02:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
that hold on a second if you can
 
02:37:11.630 --> 02:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
approach the
 
02:37:14.230 --> 02:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
microphone that would be and just say
 
02:37:18.030 --> 02:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:19.670 --> 02:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we noticed when
 
02:37:21.550 --> 02:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
we were reviewing this and then I heard
 
02:37:23.950 --> 02:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
today you're talking about potency of
 
02:37:26.790 --> 02:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
low potency of like 10% I'm growing a
 
02:37:29.590 --> 02:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
plant right so I send a plant into the
 
02:37:32.110 --> 02:37:32.120 align:start position:0%
lab to test and and first of all 10% not
 
02:37:33.830 --> 02:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
even realistic we don't even grow 10%
 
02:37:36.590 --> 02:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
strains anymore okay but let's say it's
 
02:37:39.429 --> 02:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
it's above you know what you guys put is
 
02:37:41.150 --> 02:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
the potency what am I supposed to do
 
02:37:43.710 --> 02:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
destroy it or run it into oil I you know
 
02:37:45.910 --> 02:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
I can't do that it's not like we tell
 
02:37:48.269 --> 02:37:48.279 align:start position:0%
the plant how much THC is going to be in
 
02:37:49.870 --> 02:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
it when it comes out the end and we have
 
02:37:52.790 --> 02:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
it tested but I can assure you 10% is
 
02:37:55.269 --> 02:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
not close to where where you have to be
 
02:37:58.590 --> 02:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:01.309 --> 02:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
work well I but I think the definition
 
02:38:02.830 --> 02:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
here is to what we're going to exclude
 
02:38:04.910 --> 02:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
from the definition especially after
 
02:38:07.349 --> 02:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
manufacturer right so so again it's
 
02:38:09.670 --> 02:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
about after manufacturer um what we're
 
02:38:12.150 --> 02:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
going to exclude from the definition
 
02:38:16.750 --> 02:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
correct so all right Dr
 
02:38:18.950 --> 02:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
so question the vice chair was saying
 
02:38:21.510 --> 02:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
are we are we talking about low potency
 
02:38:23.110 --> 02:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis products or are we talking
 
02:38:25.030 --> 02:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
about hemp and I think we need to be
 
02:38:27.190 --> 02:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
careful about not interchanging them so
 
02:38:30.230 --> 02:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
if it's less than3 THC then it's hemp if
 
02:38:32.230 --> 02:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's greater than that then it's maybe a
 
02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
low potency product until we get to
 
02:38:35.950 --> 02:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
another threshold but if we put the
 
02:38:38.070 --> 02:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
definition of what is considered to be
 
02:38:41.230 --> 02:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
hemp and um maybe that would take care
 
02:38:41.240 --> 02:38:44.710 align:start position:0%
hemp and um maybe that would take care
of

02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:48.670 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:38:48.670 --> 02:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:51.429 --> 02:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
right so we if we add a sentence
 
02:38:53.750 --> 02:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
basically anything that's you know
 
02:38:55.190 --> 02:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
currently under definition of hen shall
 
02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
not be falling this
 
02:39:00.870 --> 02:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
definition it might be too broad but I
 
02:39:04.750 --> 02:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
think airing on the side of caution not
 
02:39:07.590 --> 02:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
require every lighting store to get a
 
02:39:10.670 --> 02:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
license that's going to take right but I
 
02:39:13.630 --> 02:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
don't think I mean it's it currently you
 
02:39:15.830 --> 02:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
technically if if everything is as
 
02:39:18.030 --> 02:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
marketed on a container you can't get
 
02:39:20.990 --> 02:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
you can't get something that's above 3%
 
02:39:23.750 --> 02:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
currently outside of an ATC so if you
 
02:39:26.750 --> 02:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
went to the co-op and bought it there
 
02:39:28.429 --> 02:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
there shouldn't be at least what's
 
02:39:30.309 --> 02:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
currently on the label rather or not
 
02:39:33.630 --> 02:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
that tests out as different but um I
 
02:39:37.510 --> 02:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
just wonder if if we don't we're not
 
02:39:39.389 --> 02:39:39.399 align:start position:0%
specific it seems like it could be a
 
02:39:41.750 --> 02:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
problem any any
 
02:39:43.230 --> 02:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation we're not going to hold
 
02:39:45.670 --> 02:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
you to we know putting you on the spot
 
02:39:47.230 --> 02:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
yeah no I mean I think that point if
 
02:39:48.469 --> 02:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
point three is what the federal
 
02:39:50.710 --> 02:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
government Rec recognizes we put that
 
02:39:52.750 --> 02:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
there very specifically then that should
 
02:39:54.389 --> 02:39:54.399 align:start position:0%
in theory cover everything that's
 
02:39:56.830 --> 02:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
legally being sold in retail stores
 
02:39:58.510 --> 02:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
currently so doctor would you mind
 
02:40:01.070 --> 02:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
taking this as a homework project and
 
02:40:02.469 --> 02:40:02.479 align:start position:0%
rewrite this definition and bring it
 
02:40:03.670 --> 02:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
back to the next meeting so we can take
 
02:40:05.710 --> 02:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
a look at it and and evaluate it don't
 
02:40:06.870 --> 02:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
be leaving home
 
02:40:08.950 --> 02:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
or and we definitely just want to make
 
02:40:11.950 --> 02:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
sure we protect those uh
 
02:40:15.269 --> 02:40:15.279 align:start position:0%
yep so so Dr yunen will expect next
 
02:40:17.950 --> 02:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
meeting have something to revie
 
02:40:23.550 --> 02:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
that um next up is cannabis retail Chief
 
02:40:25.030 --> 02:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
I may have lost my I may have lost my
 
02:40:27.469 --> 02:40:27.479 align:start position:0%
place I apologize uh we still on uh
 
02:40:29.710 --> 02:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
paragraph seven uh eight rather yeah we
 
02:40:31.150 --> 02:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
just we just the doctor was going to do
 
02:40:33.230 --> 02:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
a review of what low potency means and
 
02:40:34.230 --> 02:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing to make sure whether
 
02:40:35.349 --> 02:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
it's covered or not covered as a
 
02:40:37.030 --> 02:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis product I'm just wondering if
 
02:40:38.670 --> 02:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
there's a reason to include Edibles in
 
02:40:43.190 --> 02:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:45.550 --> 02:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
deleted so my guess is that as we look
 
02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
further on that we're going to have a
 
02:40:48.429 --> 02:40:48.439 align:start position:0%
definition of what's eligible to sell
 
02:40:49.630 --> 02:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
and I think Edibles are going to be one
 
02:40:51.269 --> 02:40:51.279 align:start position:0%
of those definitions so we don't include
 
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
in the definition of what a cannabis
 
02:40:54.349 --> 02:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
product is it would be excluded from the
 
02:40:57.710 --> 02:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
sale process later on down the
 
02:41:03.710 --> 02:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:06.110 --> 02:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
you again well let I'm sure the doctor
 
02:41:07.950 --> 02:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
who deals with that kind of language on
 
02:41:09.469 --> 02:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
a regular basis will address it
 
02:41:12.030 --> 02:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
accordingly in her definition so moving
 
02:41:15.670 --> 02:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
on to number nine cannabis retail store
 
02:41:17.469 --> 02:41:17.479 align:start position:0%
and I will say I have an issue with this
 
02:41:19.230 --> 02:41:19.240 align:start position:0%
one and it's only because it's also in
 
02:41:20.389 --> 02:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
relation to
 
02:41:23.670 --> 02:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
number 16 we have two different
 
02:41:26.349 --> 02:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
definitions I thought we were
 
02:41:28.710 --> 02:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
consistently saying that an ATC if it
 
02:41:30.590 --> 02:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
wants to open a franchise store be
 
02:41:34.389 --> 02:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
separate from um the medical distribut
 
02:41:34.399 --> 02:41:35.510 align:start position:0%
separate from um the medical distribut
medical

02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
medical
 
02:41:37.630 --> 02:41:37.640 align:start position:0%
dispensary and so I'm not sure why we
 
02:41:39.830 --> 02:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
have two different they have we are in
 
02:41:42.110 --> 02:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
the Bill we're allowing in the turn to
 
02:41:44.110 --> 02:41:44.120 align:start position:0%
for-profit which would allow them to
 
02:41:45.990 --> 02:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
become a franchise store
 
02:41:47.269 --> 02:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
but the franchise store has to be
 
02:41:50.309 --> 02:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
separate and distinct from the medical
 
02:41:51.790 --> 02:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
store so we don't have a deal of
 
02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
Taxation issues and two masters with two
 
02:41:58.110 --> 02:41:58.120 align:start position:0%
agencies controlling the same facility
 
02:42:00.150 --> 02:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
um and so I thought we were clear on
 
02:42:01.469 --> 02:42:01.479 align:start position:0%
that so I'm not sure why we have two
 
02:42:03.590 --> 02:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
different definitions I will tell you
 
02:42:04.710 --> 02:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
well this was may have been written
 
02:42:06.190 --> 02:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
before that right things have things
 
02:42:07.630 --> 02:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
have evolved since this began its
 
02:42:11.950 --> 02:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
circulation but my understanding is so
 
02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
the alternative treatment centers they
 
02:42:15.990 --> 02:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
have the choice they can remain as
 
02:42:19.030 --> 02:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
they're operating now if they wish to
 
02:42:22.030 --> 02:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
engage in the retail Market they can
 
02:42:24.230 --> 02:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
choose to do so but to have both signs
 
02:42:26.469 --> 02:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
on the store and just trying to figure
 
02:42:29.750 --> 02:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
that out it's not not going to work well
 
02:42:31.110 --> 02:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
I agree and that's why we don't have two
 
02:42:32.389 --> 02:42:32.399 align:start position:0%
different definitions right we have a
 
02:42:33.790 --> 02:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
definition that's you're either a retail
 
02:42:35.309 --> 02:42:35.319 align:start position:0%
store and you're following the controls
 
02:42:37.630 --> 02:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
and conditions of the of the Liquor
 
02:42:39.790 --> 02:42:39.800 align:start position:0%
Commission or you're a dispensary your
 
02:42:41.190 --> 02:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
medical dispensary in which you fall
 
02:42:44.110 --> 02:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
under controls and conditions of DHHS
 
02:42:45.910 --> 02:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
and there's no two masters was involved
 
02:42:47.710 --> 02:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
and who's regulating signage who's
 
02:42:50.150 --> 02:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
regulating labeling who's regulating um
 
02:42:52.070 --> 02:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
all of that those two so my
 
02:42:55.030 --> 02:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation is to strike number nine
 
02:42:58.110 --> 02:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
and on number 16 strike the last
 
02:43:01.910 --> 02:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
sentence and that allows the the
 
02:43:05.389 --> 02:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
uh ATC to become a dispense become a
 
02:43:07.190 --> 02:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
franchise store if they choose to they
 
02:43:09.150 --> 02:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
can either um they can open a separate
 
02:43:10.630 --> 02:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
location with a separate that's all
 
02:43:12.269 --> 02:43:12.279 align:start position:0%
under controls the conditions of the
 
02:43:14.269 --> 02:43:14.279 align:start position:0%
liquor store I support
 
02:43:14.279 --> 02:43:16.469 align:start position:0%
liquor store I support
that

02:43:16.469 --> 02:43:16.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:43:20.150 --> 02:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
and so so we striking number nine
 
02:43:22.790 --> 02:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
altoe and striking the last sentence of
 
02:43:25.429 --> 02:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
number 16 that they're not prohibited
 
02:43:28.790 --> 02:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
from becoming a LIC page five 11 line 11
 
02:43:30.990 --> 02:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
and 12 there was also an issue that
 
02:43:33.230 --> 02:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
number N9 had the can's paraphernalia in
 
02:43:36.070 --> 02:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
there again so that would have been
 
02:43:38.710 --> 02:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
large so all right anyone have an issue
 
02:43:41.750 --> 02:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
with what striking paragraph 9 and then
 
02:43:47.389 --> 02:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:50.389 --> 02:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
good number 10 cannabis testing facility
 
02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:52.399 align:start position:0%
or testing
 
02:43:54.349 --> 02:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
facility so this was what I was talking
 
02:43:56.190 --> 02:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
about before if we want the state to run
 
02:43:58.990 --> 02:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
the testing facility themselves or we
 
02:44:00.870 --> 02:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
want a private facility we can have a
 
02:44:03.750 --> 02:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
little bit of both I don't know I don't
 
02:44:06.030 --> 02:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
I Know Chief you suggested that the
 
02:44:08.429 --> 02:44:08.439 align:start position:0%
state is capable of doing it that also
 
02:44:10.190 --> 02:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
means we the state would absorb the
 
02:44:11.950 --> 02:44:11.960 align:start position:0%
expense if it was private and you
 
02:44:14.389 --> 02:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
required the franchises to do it that
 
02:44:17.870 --> 02:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
would perhaps pass the expense on it and
 
02:44:19.630 --> 02:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean the state couldn't come in
 
02:44:22.070 --> 02:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
and do some testing as a kind of an
 
02:44:24.469 --> 02:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
oversight capacity but I see our our
 
02:44:28.429 --> 02:44:28.439 align:start position:0%
friend from Maine who and jumping and uh
 
02:44:30.990 --> 02:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
someone who's appeared testified about
 
02:44:37.110 --> 02:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:39.070 --> 02:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
times thank you Mr chairman for the
 
02:44:40.950 --> 02:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
record again Matt Simon Granite LEF
 
02:44:43.190 --> 02:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis just a brief comment on how
 
02:44:45.269 --> 02:44:45.279 align:start position:0%
other states have dealt with this there
 
02:44:47.349 --> 02:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
are currently no states that how do you
 
02:44:49.510 --> 02:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
recommend what's your recommendation
 
02:44:51.429 --> 02:44:51.439 align:start position:0%
I'll jump to the chase my recommendation
 
02:44:53.910 --> 02:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
would be a system that relies on private
 
02:44:57.030 --> 02:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
testing labs and the option would be to
 
02:45:00.190 --> 02:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
have a State Testing Lab that audits the
 
02:45:02.630 --> 02:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
private testing Labs so this is the
 
02:45:04.429 --> 02:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
issue that they had in Vermont there
 
02:45:06.710 --> 02:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
weren't enough testing labs and a
 
02:45:08.429 --> 02:45:08.439 align:start position:0%
product did make it to the shelf that
 
02:45:10.670 --> 02:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
hadn't been tested the state didn't have
 
02:45:12.870 --> 02:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
its own lab and the ability to recall
 
02:45:15.110 --> 02:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
that product and test it it also provid
 
02:45:17.349 --> 02:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
provides oversight in case there's an
 
02:45:19.510 --> 02:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
issue with the lab maybe not providing
 
02:45:21.990 --> 02:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
accurate test results this is a way for
 
02:45:24.230 --> 02:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
the state to immediately be able to test
 
02:45:27.070 --> 02:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
a product itself and spot check to make
 
02:45:29.950 --> 02:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
sure the independent labs are doing it
 
02:45:31.510 --> 02:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you your our friend from Maine is
 
02:45:32.950 --> 02:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
shaking his head yes which means he
 
02:45:34.190 --> 02:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
likes what you
 
02:45:37.309 --> 02:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
said so question uh Chief do you have
 
02:45:40.349 --> 02:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:42.590 --> 02:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
that not holding it to I just I mean
 
02:45:44.269 --> 02:45:44.279 align:start position:0%
does that no again we would we would
 
02:45:46.590 --> 02:45:46.600 align:start position:0%
strongly recommend State uh but I
 
02:45:48.150 --> 02:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
suppose if there has to be a compromise
 
02:45:49.870 --> 02:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
that might be a viable
 
02:45:52.269 --> 02:45:52.279 align:start position:0%
one so basically the state would be able
 
02:45:54.070 --> 02:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
to audit any results and they could even
 
02:45:55.590 --> 02:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
perform their own test if they chose to
 
02:45:58.830 --> 02:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
do so but it's passed on to a private
 
02:46:02.230 --> 02:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
business is that look I have any any
 
02:46:07.590 --> 02:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:10.510 --> 02:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
that I I think that the best way to do
 
02:46:14.190 --> 02:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
it it it would be to have private Labs
 
02:46:17.349 --> 02:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
tested and if we wanted to have a backup
 
02:46:19.950 --> 02:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
system in place that the state would do
 
02:46:23.070 --> 02:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
it but we would need to we certainly
 
02:46:25.309 --> 02:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
would need to talk to the department we
 
02:46:27.670 --> 02:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
don't want C two things I I think from a
 
02:46:29.590 --> 02:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
business standpoint we don't want it to
 
02:46:32.670 --> 02:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
be cumbersome for the product to get to
 
02:46:35.550 --> 02:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
Market uh so if it's an
 
02:46:38.309 --> 02:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
alternative then we would be in favor of
 
02:46:40.710 --> 02:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
that but I I certainly don't want
 
02:46:42.790 --> 02:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
to yeah we don't want to speak for the
 
02:46:44.070 --> 02:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety because obviously
 
02:46:45.389 --> 02:46:45.399 align:start position:0%
that would be the labbing that would be
 
02:46:46.550 --> 02:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
the lab facility that would do the
 
02:46:48.309 --> 02:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
testing so you know I don't think we
 
02:46:50.190 --> 02:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
would want to talk about what testing
 
02:46:51.950 --> 02:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
the department of St we also want to
 
02:46:54.070 --> 02:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
overburden the Department of safety's
 
02:46:58.349 --> 02:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
Labs testing this versus yeah correct Mr
 
02:47:00.150 --> 02:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
going back to the definition I think
 
02:47:02.309 --> 02:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
this allows for that either a state run
 
02:47:04.389 --> 02:47:04.399 align:start position:0%
model or an a third party independent
 
02:47:06.230 --> 02:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
model and would also depending on the
 
02:47:08.030 --> 02:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
regulations when we get into the testing
 
02:47:10.150 --> 02:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
which I think is in here um it would
 
02:47:12.910 --> 02:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
allow for either the liquor to require
 
02:47:14.309 --> 02:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
you know to say we're going to take this
 
02:47:15.710 --> 02:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
product and we're go to a different
 
02:47:17.190 --> 02:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
testing facility licensed testing
 
02:47:18.630 --> 02:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
facility have them test the product to
 
02:47:20.910 --> 02:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
verify the first testing I think again
 
02:47:22.150 --> 02:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
that's going to fall underneath the
 
02:47:24.309 --> 02:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
regulation aspect of this and not
 
02:47:26.389 --> 02:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily the legal aspect of the law
 
02:47:28.150 --> 02:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
aspect right um it's going to be in
 
02:47:30.710 --> 02:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
regulatory requirements and and M Matt
 
02:47:33.429 --> 02:47:33.439 align:start position:0%
Simon if you don't mind you mentioned a
 
02:47:35.389 --> 02:47:35.399 align:start position:0%
what another state did I think Vermont
 
02:47:37.190 --> 02:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
if you can provide the commission that
 
02:47:42.870 --> 02:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:44.429 --> 02:47:44.439 align:start position:0%
appreciated but I bet you're well
 
02:47:48.309 --> 02:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:52.030 --> 02:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
definition next up is number 11 cannabis
 
02:47:54.429 --> 02:47:54.439 align:start position:0%
transporter any conversations around
 
02:47:57.349 --> 02:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
here again this is um a licensed
 
02:47:57.359 --> 02:47:58.950 align:start position:0%
here again this is um a licensed
entity

02:47:58.950 --> 02:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
entity
 
02:47:58.960 --> 02:48:00.790 align:start position:0%
entity
so

02:48:00.790 --> 02:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:03.630 --> 02:48:03.640 align:start position:0%
if if you're an ENT if you're an entity
 
02:48:07.309 --> 02:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
right that's cultivating but you're also
 
02:48:08.910 --> 02:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
you're transport to your own retail
 
02:48:11.469 --> 02:48:11.479 align:start position:0%
store you have to have a separate
 
02:48:13.790 --> 02:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
license to transport it from one to the
 
02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:16.550 align:start position:0%
license to transport it from one to the
other

02:48:16.550 --> 02:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:48:19.030 --> 02:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
yes specifically for transporting can
 
02:48:22.510 --> 02:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis one involves a DOT right over
 
02:48:24.670 --> 02:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
what's that do it's over the
 
02:48:27.230 --> 02:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
highways well again I think I think the
 
02:48:31.030 --> 02:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
idea behind here is about um again in
 
02:48:32.830 --> 02:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
every step of the process we have
 
02:48:35.110 --> 02:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
control and licensure happening so
 
02:48:37.190 --> 02:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's no unregulated unlicensed part
 
02:48:39.110 --> 02:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
that's happening in between so from the
 
02:48:40.510 --> 02:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
time you go to cultivation you move it
 
02:48:41.910 --> 02:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
to manufacturing the person that moves
 
02:48:43.469 --> 02:48:43.479 align:start position:0%
it from cultivation to manufacturing
 
02:48:45.429 --> 02:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
must be licensed unless it's assume it
 
02:48:47.230 --> 02:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
could be within the same facility if the
 
02:48:48.790 --> 02:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
cultivator also had a manufacturing
 
02:48:49.950 --> 02:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
license you're moving it from building
 
02:48:51.150 --> 02:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
to building and that's on your own
 
02:48:53.110 --> 02:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
property you'd be okay but if you had to
 
02:48:56.150 --> 02:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
move it from Kean to Portsmith for
 
02:48:58.309 --> 02:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturing then that Transportation
 
02:48:59.870 --> 02:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
would require that person would need to
 
02:49:01.230 --> 02:49:01.240 align:start position:0%
be licensed and then if you're moving it
 
02:49:03.469 --> 02:49:03.479 align:start position:0%
from the manufacturing facility to the
 
02:49:05.309 --> 02:49:05.319 align:start position:0%
to the retail store again that person
 
02:49:06.670 --> 02:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
would have license so you have a
 
02:49:10.710 --> 02:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
complete closed loop on on from from
 
02:49:11.870 --> 02:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
seed to
 
02:49:14.230 --> 02:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
sale I was getting at the point if
 
02:49:14.240 --> 02:49:15.230 align:start position:0%
sale I was getting at the point if
you're

02:49:15.230 --> 02:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:49:18.830 --> 02:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
a cultivator and a manufacturer and you
 
02:49:21.870 --> 02:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
want to ship it to the stores you you
 
02:49:24.469 --> 02:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
get an additional license now
 
02:49:26.349 --> 02:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
transporter even if you're also the
 
02:49:28.229 --> 02:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
retailer you so you're basically I know
 
02:49:29.870 --> 02:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
it I know there's separate entities
 
02:49:31.590 --> 02:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes but it's it's same guys
 
02:49:33.150 --> 02:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
operating everything
 
02:49:35.309 --> 02:49:35.319 align:start position:0%
right they couldn't have I guess a
 
02:49:40.469 --> 02:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
manufacturer or a Heth can't have an
 
02:49:42.550 --> 02:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
in-house Mr chairman I don't think it
 
02:49:45.349 --> 02:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
needs to become a burdensome um process
 
02:49:48.670 --> 02:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
of Licensing I think to to the Senator's
 
02:49:51.429 --> 02:49:51.439 align:start position:0%
point it's just that seed to sale
 
02:49:53.870 --> 02:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
process and where the product is going
 
02:49:56.870 --> 02:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
and I would I would also add that from
 
02:49:59.950 --> 02:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
our standpoint from a retail standpoint
 
02:50:02.389 --> 02:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
for the state we would want to make sure
 
02:50:05.469 --> 02:50:05.479 align:start position:0%
that the manufacturers and The Growers
 
02:50:07.630 --> 02:50:07.640 align:start position:0%
had the ability to do this to keep the
 
02:50:07.640 --> 02:50:08.630 align:start position:0%
had the ability to do this to keep the
costs

02:50:08.630 --> 02:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:50:11.030 --> 02:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
down and I know with with alcohol we
 
02:50:12.550 --> 02:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
have a really good system in place when
 
02:50:15.630 --> 02:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
it comes to distribution so we have one
 
02:50:17.990 --> 02:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
distribution system one
 
02:50:20.429 --> 02:50:20.439 align:start position:0%
Warehouse when it comes to when it comes
 
02:50:20.439 --> 02:50:23.070 align:start position:0%
Warehouse when it comes to when it comes
to

02:50:23.070 --> 02:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:50:28.710 --> 02:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:31.070 --> 02:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
definition number 12 commission means in
 
02:50:32.510 --> 02:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
the hampsh Laker
 
02:50:35.429 --> 02:50:35.439 align:start position:0%
commission wor with that all right that
 
02:50:40.550 --> 02:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
was an easy one um number 13
 
02:50:42.710 --> 02:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
consumer any discussion around the
 
02:50:48.190 --> 02:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:51.229 --> 02:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:50:55.469 --> 02:50:55.479 align:start position:0%
well um there was one discussion I we
 
02:50:57.750 --> 02:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
had somewhat off record but if we had
 
02:51:01.150 --> 02:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
the retail product and rather than have
 
02:51:03.110 --> 02:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
separate atcs they have their branded
 
02:51:05.349 --> 02:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
product and they could then have we
 
02:51:06.630 --> 02:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
could create an opportunity where they
 
02:51:09.710 --> 02:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
can sell their therapeutic gr product in
 
02:51:11.910 --> 02:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
any retail store if that franchise he
 
02:51:14.349 --> 02:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to adopt that policy if we did
 
02:51:14.359 --> 02:51:15.830 align:start position:0%
wanted to adopt that policy if we did
that

02:51:15.830 --> 02:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:51:18.229 --> 02:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
um it would be sold only to people have
 
02:51:19.830 --> 02:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic
 
02:51:23.190 --> 02:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
car so you're talking about mixing
 
02:51:26.550 --> 02:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
medical into the retail store so let's
 
02:51:29.710 --> 02:51:29.720 align:start position:0%
let's say let's say all the atc's be be
 
02:51:33.389 --> 02:51:33.399 align:start position:0%
adopted opted in a granted a franchise
 
02:51:36.750 --> 02:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
from the state uh the issue is is their
 
02:51:38.790 --> 02:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
branding would essentially he says from
 
02:51:40.750 --> 02:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
a storefront go away but they still have
 
02:51:42.030 --> 02:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
the products that they're manufacturing
 
02:51:44.309 --> 02:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
and cultivating right now I presume they
 
02:51:45.990 --> 02:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
would likely continous sells out of
 
02:51:48.630 --> 02:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
their own now retail store but what
 
02:51:50.590 --> 02:51:50.600 align:start position:0%
happens to the therapeutic system the
 
02:51:52.070 --> 02:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
idea is you can still have therapeutic
 
02:51:54.349 --> 02:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
grade products but then maybe permit
 
02:51:56.670 --> 02:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
them to any franchise be allowed to sell
 
02:51:58.630 --> 02:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
them provided the person had the
 
02:52:01.269 --> 02:52:01.279 align:start position:0%
therapeutic car it it does you don't
 
02:52:02.670 --> 02:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
want to have the unfair marke Advantage
 
02:52:05.309 --> 02:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
where some franchises have therapeutic
 
02:52:06.550 --> 02:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
products and some
 
02:52:09.110 --> 02:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
don't but we want
 
02:52:12.550 --> 02:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
to so again this goes to the comingling
 
02:52:15.309 --> 02:52:15.319 align:start position:0%
of regulatory requirements right so my
 
02:52:17.389 --> 02:52:17.399 align:start position:0%
inclination was anybody who chooses
 
02:52:19.429 --> 02:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
again it's a choice to put up a retail
 
02:52:21.070 --> 02:52:21.080 align:start position:0%
store be subject to the rules and
 
02:52:23.229 --> 02:52:23.239 align:start position:0%
regulations and conditions of the Liquor
 
02:52:24.710 --> 02:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
Commission and so if the Liquor
 
02:52:26.990 --> 02:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
Commission approves this moving of their
 
02:52:30.110 --> 02:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
product into that into that store again
 
02:52:32.710 --> 02:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
all The Branding and labeling is subject
 
02:52:35.469 --> 02:52:35.479 align:start position:0%
to The Liquor Commission correct and and
 
02:52:35.479 --> 02:52:37.030 align:start position:0%
to The Liquor Commission correct and and
the

02:52:37.030 --> 02:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:52:39.349 --> 02:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
therapeutic the atcs would then fall
 
02:52:43.429 --> 02:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
under the regulation of of liquor as
 
02:52:45.750 --> 02:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
well store operations would fall
 
02:52:48.150 --> 02:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
underneath liquor not their medical
 
02:52:50.389 --> 02:52:50.399 align:start position:0%
distribution proper no as it's written
 
02:52:52.229 --> 02:52:52.239 align:start position:0%
that's that's what you're right I'm
 
02:52:55.150 --> 02:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
asking I'm proposing that we I don't
 
02:52:57.190 --> 02:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
want to cross Bingle that does our folks
 
02:52:59.630 --> 02:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
in the atcs have any comment as they sit
 
02:53:09.229 --> 02:53:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:11.190 --> 02:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
together you don't mind uh taking the
 
02:53:14.590 --> 02:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
mic I'm I'm just saying in that case
 
02:53:16.309 --> 02:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to be sold out other
 
02:53:21.950 --> 02:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:24.150 --> 02:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
sense I'm sorry Mr chairman I'm still
 
02:53:26.429 --> 02:53:26.439 align:start position:0%
not clear on the question you're asking
 
02:53:30.190 --> 02:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
here so if rather than your stores
 
02:53:32.790 --> 02:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
remaining keeping their own identity on
 
02:53:34.389 --> 02:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
a storefront basis you still have the
 
02:53:36.510 --> 02:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
products that that you your therapeutic
 
02:53:38.950 --> 02:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
products correct now those have their
 
02:53:41.750 --> 02:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
own brand ID identity as well correct
 
02:53:45.349 --> 02:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
those products if each of your respected
 
02:53:47.950 --> 02:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
establishments became a retail store it
 
02:53:49.389 --> 02:53:49.399 align:start position:0%
would have to have the New
 
02:53:52.870 --> 02:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire franchisee logo and that's it
 
02:53:54.950 --> 02:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm what I'm suggesting is if you
 
02:53:56.950 --> 02:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
still want to sell your therapeutic
 
02:53:58.510 --> 02:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
grade products which I my understanding
 
02:54:02.070 --> 02:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
is you do uh it does somewhat result in
 
02:54:04.790 --> 02:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
unfair Market Advantage if only certain
 
02:54:07.830 --> 02:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
retail stores are able to sell the
 
02:54:09.349 --> 02:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
therapeutic great
 
02:54:11.190 --> 02:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
products I would think it would be to
 
02:54:13.590 --> 02:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
the atc's benefit if all the retail
 
02:54:16.070 --> 02:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
stores had opportun to sell the products
 
02:54:19.190 --> 02:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
that you atc's could exclusively
 
02:54:23.110 --> 02:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
manufacture but at the same time if we
 
02:54:25.710 --> 02:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
went that direction you I think it would
 
02:54:28.030 --> 02:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
make sense for a lot of the oversight
 
02:54:30.790 --> 02:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
and enforcement regulation to fall under
 
02:54:33.309 --> 02:54:33.319 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission not
 
02:54:36.670 --> 02:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
DHHS uh with that being said if we went
 
02:54:38.070 --> 02:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
that direction which is the direction I
 
02:54:40.389 --> 02:54:40.399 align:start position:0%
would like to go not sure if my friend
 
02:54:42.309 --> 02:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
to my left agrees I'm not sure how
 
02:54:44.950 --> 02:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
everyone else feels about that
 
02:54:48.870 --> 02:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
it how does the atcs feel about that
 
02:54:51.110 --> 02:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
well as we said last week we do have a
 
02:54:52.950 --> 02:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
strong preference to be able to operate
 
02:54:54.990 --> 02:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
dual use locations we understand that's
 
02:54:57.110 --> 02:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
a policy choice for the commission and
 
02:55:00.630 --> 02:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
for ultimately for the general court um
 
02:55:02.790 --> 02:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
there are a number of policy questions
 
02:55:05.950 --> 02:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
kind of rolled into one here uh we would
 
02:55:07.790 --> 02:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
like to be able to expand access to
 
02:55:09.670 --> 02:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
patients so they don't have to drive to
 
02:55:11.550 --> 02:55:11.560 align:start position:0%
one of seven locations it would be
 
02:55:13.229 --> 02:55:13.239 align:start position:0%
beneficial for patients if they could
 
02:55:16.670 --> 02:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
purchase their at cannabis at any store
 
02:55:18.750 --> 02:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
um the only question is how to provide
 
02:55:21.070 --> 02:55:21.080 align:start position:0%
the education and support services that
 
02:55:23.349 --> 02:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
particularly firsttime patients and
 
02:55:25.469 --> 02:55:25.479 align:start position:0%
making their initial purchases would
 
02:55:27.510 --> 02:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
need there are some gaps that we think
 
02:55:29.030 --> 02:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
would need to be filled and we think
 
02:55:32.389 --> 02:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
those gaps can be filled um but in terms
 
02:55:34.550 --> 02:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
of whether it's a unfair advantage or or
 
02:55:36.469 --> 02:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
disadvantage I mean we're not talking
 
02:55:37.950 --> 02:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
about a huge Market here we're talking
 
02:55:40.790 --> 02:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
about 13,000 registered patients a
 
02:55:43.349 --> 02:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
number that's likely to decline after
 
02:55:46.269 --> 02:55:46.279 align:start position:0%
adult use so in part there is an
 
02:55:48.150 --> 02:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
advantage being able to serve both
 
02:55:50.429 --> 02:55:50.439 align:start position:0%
markets but it's also a bit of a
 
02:55:53.190 --> 02:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
disadvantage or at least a burden that
 
02:55:56.110 --> 02:55:56.120 align:start position:0%
we would be required to continue serving
 
02:55:58.630 --> 02:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
patients and making for example small
 
02:56:00.870 --> 02:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
batches of products that aren't really
 
02:56:03.150 --> 02:56:03.160 align:start position:0%
financially lucrative so it's kind of a
 
02:56:05.030 --> 02:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
mix of advantages and disadvantages I
 
02:56:06.990 --> 02:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
would suggest no one's requiring the
 
02:56:10.870 --> 02:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
atcs to sell to other stores that that's
 
02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
again that's a business decision left to
 
02:56:16.790 --> 02:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
be made by each of you respectfully and
 
02:56:18.229 --> 02:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
one of you may choose to do it some of
 
02:56:21.550 --> 02:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
you may not but I think the issue is
 
02:56:23.670 --> 02:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
when it comes to defining consumer I
 
02:56:25.870 --> 02:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
thought if you did that it's you know
 
02:56:27.349 --> 02:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
you're going to have other Revenue
 
02:56:29.190 --> 02:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
sources from cultivation but I would
 
02:56:33.269 --> 02:56:33.279 align:start position:0%
like to see if that's for Consumer
 
02:56:35.030 --> 02:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
definition wise we may not want to have
 
02:56:36.389 --> 02:56:36.399 align:start position:0%
a distinction between the two for the
 
02:56:38.790 --> 02:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
purposes of this
 
02:56:42.309 --> 02:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
chapter sure so if I may provide a
 
02:56:44.070 --> 02:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully relatively simple answer
 
02:56:47.269 --> 02:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
answer is that generally the regulations
 
02:56:50.150 --> 02:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
between adult use and medical are very
 
02:56:52.110 --> 02:56:52.120 align:start position:0%
similar in Most states and I would
 
02:56:54.510 --> 02:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
expect them to be extremely similar here
 
02:56:57.550 --> 02:56:57.560 align:start position:0%
if not able to be made identical so I
 
02:56:58.790 --> 02:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
would hope that there' be limited
 
02:57:00.510 --> 02:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
barriers to the opportunity of doing
 
02:57:05.190 --> 02:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:08.110 --> 02:57:08.120 align:start position:0%
doable again
 
02:57:11.349 --> 02:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
so my concern is is a dual use single
 
02:57:14.070 --> 02:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
store is problematic for both regulatory
 
02:57:16.429 --> 02:57:16.439 align:start position:0%
reasons as well as taxation reasons
 
02:57:18.710 --> 02:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
about what what products are are not
 
02:57:20.590 --> 02:57:20.600 align:start position:0%
taxed and which drawer do you put the
 
02:57:22.950 --> 02:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
money in um I mean all kinds of basic
 
02:57:24.630 --> 02:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
functional problems that I think it's
 
02:57:27.229 --> 02:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
hard for liquor to be able to deal with
 
02:57:31.070 --> 02:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
the Dual use single store um I was clear
 
02:57:34.550 --> 02:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
I I supported dual again atcs or atc's
 
02:57:36.870 --> 02:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
retail stores or retail stores separate
 
02:57:38.630 --> 02:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
models separate regulatory models
 
02:57:40.910 --> 02:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
separate regulatory agencies that deal
 
02:57:43.510 --> 02:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
with that that does not prohibit um an
 
02:57:45.630 --> 02:57:45.640 align:start position:0%
at see who may have a strain of product
 
02:57:47.870 --> 02:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
they want to offer in the retail store
 
02:57:50.070 --> 02:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that however the
 
02:57:52.510 --> 02:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
labeling and testing would be subject to
 
02:57:55.309 --> 02:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
the rules and conditions that that uh
 
02:57:57.030 --> 02:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
the liquor store would put on it so you
 
02:58:00.309 --> 02:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
can move product a you know you grow a
 
02:58:02.389 --> 02:58:02.399 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of product a and you'll use
 
02:58:05.269 --> 02:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
a section of it for um for your medical
 
02:58:06.830 --> 02:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
distribution but then you also go to
 
02:58:08.590 --> 02:58:08.600 align:start position:0%
liquor and say I want to approve have
 
02:58:10.070 --> 02:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
this product approved for the sale in
 
02:58:11.830 --> 02:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
the retail store you can sell that in
 
02:58:13.710 --> 02:58:13.720 align:start position:0%
your own retail store or you can offer
 
02:58:15.750 --> 02:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
it for all retail stores again that's up
 
02:58:17.469 --> 02:58:17.479 align:start position:0%
to you based on your private model that
 
02:58:20.469 --> 02:58:20.479 align:start position:0%
you would have so you may have um
 
02:58:22.950 --> 02:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
product a in retail store one but you
 
02:58:24.590 --> 02:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
don't own retail store 2 so therefore
 
02:58:26.030 --> 02:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
you're not making it available to retail
 
02:58:27.750 --> 02:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
store two and that's your competitive
 
02:58:29.269 --> 02:58:29.279 align:start position:0%
Advantage is the product that's
 
02:58:30.750 --> 02:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
available in the med in the medical
 
02:58:32.710 --> 02:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
could also be available in the in your
 
02:58:35.670 --> 02:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
retail store for you to manage so I
 
02:58:37.070 --> 02:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
think that's the competitive Advantage
 
02:58:39.070 --> 02:58:39.080 align:start position:0%
but I do not want to enter into a situ I
 
02:58:40.790 --> 02:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to enter into a situation
 
02:58:42.670 --> 02:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
about who's the controlling Authority in
 
02:58:44.790 --> 02:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
a given square footage of a building
 
02:58:48.710 --> 02:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
based on Dual use in a single space so I
 
02:58:51.990 --> 02:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
think we're
 
02:58:54.070 --> 02:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
basically it's not going to if you're
 
02:58:55.710 --> 02:58:55.720 align:start position:0%
going to do retail you know I don't
 
02:58:57.750 --> 02:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
think selling therapeutic in either
 
02:58:58.990 --> 02:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
going to be sold in all the retail
 
02:59:00.910 --> 02:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
stores or none of them that's up to them
 
02:59:00.920 --> 02:59:01.790 align:start position:0%
stores or none of them that's up to them
that

02:59:01.790 --> 02:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:59:04.630 --> 02:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
said well I think that they rather sell
 
02:59:07.150 --> 02:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
in all of them than none of them I
 
02:59:09.830 --> 02:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
assume so again they can apply a lottery
 
02:59:11.670 --> 02:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
for their flower a product to be
 
02:59:13.670 --> 02:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
available in all retail stores or they
 
02:59:15.030 --> 02:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
can say I only want to do it in my
 
02:59:16.710 --> 02:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
private store as as I'm sure the rest of
 
02:59:18.510 --> 02:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
the commission is enjoying this healthy
 
02:59:20.469 --> 02:59:20.479 align:start position:0%
discussion Senator Lang and I are having
 
02:59:22.710 --> 02:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
does anyone else have any comment on I
 
02:59:25.469 --> 02:59:25.479 align:start position:0%
want to join the healthy discussion U
 
02:59:27.670 --> 02:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative kale I'm always up for a
 
02:59:29.150 --> 02:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
healthy discussion I I'm kind of
 
02:59:31.830 --> 02:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
wondering what what the commission the
 
02:59:34.190 --> 02:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
proposed commission thinks are are they
 
02:59:38.110 --> 02:59:38.120 align:start position:0%
um are they game for maybe uh taking
 
02:59:40.750 --> 02:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
over um control over the th and
 
02:59:42.830 --> 02:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
completely removing it from
 
02:59:42.840 --> 02:59:45.510 align:start position:0%
completely removing it from
DHHS

02:59:45.510 --> 02:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
DHHS
 
02:59:47.269 --> 02:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
well I don't think they're going to
 
02:59:49.070 --> 02:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
preference are they are they capable of
 
02:59:50.910 --> 02:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
doing it I guess is the
 
02:59:53.309 --> 02:59:53.319 align:start position:0%
question we're certainly capable of
 
02:59:55.710 --> 02:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
doing it as far as having a
 
02:59:57.590 --> 02:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
preference I don't think we have a
 
02:59:59.349 --> 02:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
preference on it I would say the other
 
03:00:01.550 --> 03:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
part part of that is that even ATC
 
03:00:03.670 --> 03:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
products would essentially be part of
 
03:00:06.309 --> 03:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
the franchise fee but I we have to I'm
 
03:00:07.630 --> 03:00:07.640 align:start position:0%
not sure if the business side of that
 
03:00:09.830 --> 03:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
make sense if if you distribute to the
 
03:00:11.190 --> 03:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
other stores depends on how many stores
 
03:00:13.389 --> 03:00:13.399 align:start position:0%
are are and your cultivation I think
 
03:00:16.030 --> 03:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
making it easier to to account for
 
03:00:17.990 --> 03:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
everything rather than having
 
03:00:20.550 --> 03:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
separate draw is
 
03:00:23.750 --> 03:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
that yeah uh just one comment uh Brandon
 
03:00:25.750 --> 03:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
Pollock with tascal Wellness One the
 
03:00:28.550 --> 03:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
atc's in so far as an operational
 
03:00:30.630 --> 03:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
perspective it's not our policy choice
 
03:00:33.190 --> 03:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
but from an operational perspective if
 
03:00:35.429 --> 03:00:35.439 align:start position:0%
accessories for example or paraphernalia
 
03:00:37.590 --> 03:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
will not be subject to a franchise fee I
 
03:00:40.830 --> 03:00:40.840 align:start position:0%
think a therapeutic product would have
 
03:00:44.030 --> 03:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
no additional issues of that sort of
 
03:00:47.830 --> 03:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:50.229 --> 03:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
structure I mean I definitely think our
 
03:00:53.269 --> 03:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
goal as as as as a committee should be
 
03:00:54.790 --> 03:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
able to keep the cost for the
 
03:00:58.309 --> 03:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
therapeutic users as low as we possibly
 
03:01:01.630 --> 03:01:01.640 align:start position:0%
can I understand that my concern is when
 
03:01:05.030 --> 03:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
it comes to a franchise agreement if you
 
03:01:08.229 --> 03:01:08.239 align:start position:0%
don't have the 15% at the beginning I'm
 
03:01:09.349 --> 03:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
not really clear you're going to be able
 
03:01:11.790 --> 03:01:11.800 align:start position:0%
to add it down the line in a responsible
 
03:01:14.070 --> 03:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
way so it's kind of now and never and
 
03:01:15.910 --> 03:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
from what it sounds like the therapeutic
 
03:01:19.150 --> 03:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
industry is going to might get smaller
 
03:01:21.269 --> 03:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
and smaller and smaller I'm not saying
 
03:01:23.429 --> 03:01:23.439 align:start position:0%
go away completely but it might become a
 
03:01:27.269 --> 03:01:27.279 align:start position:0%
very minor sector of the market and at
 
03:01:28.269 --> 03:01:28.279 align:start position:0%
that point you're going to have all
 
03:01:30.309 --> 03:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
these therapeutic products people what
 
03:01:32.070 --> 03:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
happens in Massachusetts there's like a
 
03:01:35.790 --> 03:01:35.800 align:start position:0%
20% sales tax which is very high you can
 
03:01:38.309 --> 03:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
spend $300 a or I don't know if that's
 
03:01:40.550 --> 03:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
the exact price for a license a medical
 
03:01:42.670 --> 03:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
card or whatever they call it and you're
 
03:01:45.269 --> 03:01:45.279 align:start position:0%
exempt from that tax
 
03:01:47.229 --> 03:01:47.239 align:start position:0%
all the way for the rest of the year you
 
03:01:48.429 --> 03:01:48.439 align:start position:0%
also get to cut the line and have your
 
03:01:51.309 --> 03:01:51.319 align:start position:0%
own register it gets around the revenue
 
03:01:53.510 --> 03:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
side of things so one thing that could
 
03:01:56.030 --> 03:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
happen is that the therapeutic side can
 
03:01:59.150 --> 03:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
kind of readjust its policies and be get
 
03:02:00.750 --> 03:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
a larger market share it's going to cut
 
03:02:03.349 --> 03:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
into the franchise fee and rather than
 
03:02:06.630 --> 03:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
have those competing interests it seems
 
03:02:08.750 --> 03:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to essentially Grant valid
 
03:02:10.389 --> 03:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
on manufacturing the higher therapeutic
 
03:02:12.550 --> 03:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
grade stuff but it's not going to
 
03:02:15.429 --> 03:02:15.439 align:start position:0%
overtake or really diminish the
 
03:02:17.790 --> 03:02:17.800 align:start position:0%
franchise model it seems like everyone's
 
03:02:19.990 --> 03:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
kind of getting in a good position there
 
03:02:22.070 --> 03:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
but if you don't do the 15% now or
 
03:02:24.710 --> 03:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
whatever we whatever that franchise feed
 
03:02:27.429 --> 03:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
is determined to be adding it in three
 
03:02:28.870 --> 03:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
years from now five years from now I
 
03:02:32.429 --> 03:02:32.439 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's legal appropriate
 
03:02:34.389 --> 03:02:34.399 align:start position:0%
fair business model so if you're going
 
03:02:36.990 --> 03:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
to do it you want to do it now not later
 
03:02:39.550 --> 03:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:41.269 --> 03:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
opinion let everyone know what they're
 
03:02:43.110 --> 03:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
getting into we don't have to answer
 
03:02:45.030 --> 03:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
this today it's
 
03:02:47.990 --> 03:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
again this is good discussion imagine if
 
03:02:49.429 --> 03:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
we didn't do it now then three years
 
03:02:51.309 --> 03:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
from now we decided to add 15% you're
 
03:02:53.030 --> 03:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at us like where're
 
03:02:54.910 --> 03:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
how how how could we so I think it's
 
03:02:57.550 --> 03:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
important to know what the commitment is
 
03:03:00.349 --> 03:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
and and let us know business-wise
 
03:03:02.030 --> 03:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps maybe the next meeting comment
 
03:03:03.389 --> 03:03:03.399 align:start position:0%
on that sure I would just suggest there
 
03:03:04.750 --> 03:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
are other stakeholders who'd be
 
03:03:06.790 --> 03:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
interested in this in this policy choice
 
03:03:08.590 --> 03:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
and certainly patients would would
 
03:03:10.950 --> 03:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
object to a tax or fee being imposed
 
03:03:12.349 --> 03:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
that would apply to them that does not
 
03:03:15.389 --> 03:03:15.399 align:start position:0%
currently the the fee is paid by the the
 
03:03:17.550 --> 03:03:17.560 align:start position:0%
franchisee you know how you adjust your
 
03:03:19.910 --> 03:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
prices to the consumer you can really
 
03:03:21.750 --> 03:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
take care of the patients you know
 
03:03:23.269 --> 03:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to judge that any
 
03:03:25.630 --> 03:03:25.640 align:start position:0%
way you can um and that's why I'm asking
 
03:03:27.070 --> 03:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
does the business sense make sense
 
03:03:28.910 --> 03:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
remember you guys are going to make
 
03:03:30.670 --> 03:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
money off cultivation
 
03:03:33.349 --> 03:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
sales to to all the retail stores that
 
03:03:34.590 --> 03:03:34.600 align:start position:0%
are out there there's other Revenue that
 
03:03:38.309 --> 03:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
can be made as well so I think it's
 
03:03:39.469 --> 03:03:39.479 align:start position:0%
hopefully that should keep the price
 
03:03:39.479 --> 03:03:41.150 align:start position:0%
hopefully that should keep the price
down

03:03:41.150 --> 03:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
down
 
03:03:43.990 --> 03:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
too but okay
 
03:03:45.710 --> 03:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
move on from consumer we'll come back to
 
03:03:48.590 --> 03:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
Consumer definition um Department means
 
03:03:49.630 --> 03:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
03:03:53.309 --> 03:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
Services number
 
03:03:57.070 --> 03:03:57.080 align:start position:0%
14 any discussion there we're good well
 
03:03:59.750 --> 03:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
do do we do we want to completely remove
 
03:04:03.150 --> 03:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
DHHS completely from any control over
 
03:04:05.429 --> 03:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
over well I think later on in the in the
 
03:04:06.870 --> 03:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
bill we have some conversations where
 
03:04:09.389 --> 03:04:09.399 align:start position:0%
DHHS might have some stuff around Labs
 
03:04:11.910 --> 03:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
or some other testing and lab some other
 
03:04:13.150 --> 03:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
component so I think that's the only
 
03:04:15.150 --> 03:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
reason and there again we need a
 
03:04:16.910 --> 03:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
definition if we talk about the we talk
 
03:04:17.910 --> 03:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
about the commission we talk about the
 
03:04:19.229 --> 03:04:19.239 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission we say Department
 
03:04:20.190 --> 03:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the Department of
 
03:04:23.710 --> 03:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:26.030 --> 03:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
Services number 14 we addressed are
 
03:04:27.990 --> 03:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
there any other uh so we struck we
 
03:04:30.030 --> 03:04:30.040 align:start position:0%
agreed to strike the last line last
 
03:04:31.990 --> 03:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
sentence is there any other changes to
 
03:04:35.590 --> 03:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
number 14 or 16
 
03:04:39.630 --> 03:04:39.640 align:start position:0%
rather Mr chairman chief on 16 uh in
 
03:04:41.150 --> 03:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
light of some of the testimony we heard
 
03:04:43.429 --> 03:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
earlier today we'd like to recommend
 
03:04:45.630 --> 03:04:45.640 align:start position:0%
that uh this refer only to in-person
 
03:04:48.630 --> 03:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
sales that it not be online sales or
 
03:04:52.950 --> 03:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:55.630 --> 03:04:55.640 align:start position:0%
nature does anyone have any any comment
 
03:04:55.640 --> 03:04:58.229 align:start position:0%
nature does anyone have any any comment
on

03:04:58.229 --> 03:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:01.790 --> 03:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
that uh you can make an online sale of
 
03:05:03.710 --> 03:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
Dunkin Donuts but you got to show up to
 
03:05:06.790 --> 03:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:10.150 --> 03:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
up so that that needs to be addressed
 
03:05:13.349 --> 03:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
Chief when you say no online sales
 
03:05:15.710 --> 03:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
you're talking about online and
 
03:05:19.269 --> 03:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
delivered by a third party
 
03:05:22.710 --> 03:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
sales yeah okay you could still you
 
03:05:26.110 --> 03:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
could still uh order it order it online
 
03:05:27.389 --> 03:05:27.399 align:start position:0%
but you have to pick it up but you have
 
03:05:30.510 --> 03:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
to be picked up or yeah I tend to I I
 
03:05:33.110 --> 03:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
agree with that I could live with that
 
03:05:35.030 --> 03:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
so what are we looking for a CH where
 
03:05:36.990 --> 03:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
where do you want to put the change at
 
03:05:40.670 --> 03:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
the bottom or the the end of 16 okay
 
03:05:42.269 --> 03:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
what do you want it would just say
 
03:05:44.830 --> 03:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
inperson sales only or we could be more
 
03:05:47.389 --> 03:05:47.399 align:start position:0%
specific with the online but the whole
 
03:05:49.950 --> 03:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
idea is just to make sure that people
 
03:05:52.550 --> 03:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
aren't you know again in L of uh in
 
03:05:55.630 --> 03:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
reference to the earlier testimony about
 
03:05:57.469 --> 03:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
the difficulties that for example Maine
 
03:06:01.229 --> 03:06:01.239 align:start position:0%
was having with online or not in person
 
03:06:02.830 --> 03:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
and being able to identify themselves as
 
03:06:05.070 --> 03:06:05.080 align:start position:0%
an individual capable of buying I mean
 
03:06:06.830 --> 03:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
people do that with alcohol all the time
 
03:06:10.229 --> 03:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
now they're buying it and miners are
 
03:06:13.990 --> 03:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
buying it uh online and what have you so
 
03:06:15.950 --> 03:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
so the question one thing I want to be
 
03:06:18.750 --> 03:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
careful of is if it extra if it ex if
 
03:06:21.229 --> 03:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
the program expends extends to the point
 
03:06:23.590 --> 03:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
where I could go online and order it but
 
03:06:25.269 --> 03:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
I have to go in person to pick it up
 
03:06:27.229 --> 03:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
pick it up right so it allows for online
 
03:06:28.790 --> 03:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
ordering but in
 
03:06:32.429 --> 03:06:32.439 align:start position:0%
person um distribution
 
03:06:36.229 --> 03:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
sure I agree with that I I think
 
03:06:39.229 --> 03:06:39.239 align:start position:0%
um we certainly not there yet if that
 
03:06:40.590 --> 03:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
policy is Revisited by Future
 
03:06:43.190 --> 03:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
legislators but I think out of the gate
 
03:06:44.830 --> 03:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
you got to come in person that's just
 
03:06:46.190 --> 03:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I'm talking to we TR
 
03:06:47.750 --> 03:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that's the situation so
 
03:06:50.710 --> 03:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not yeah I mean one of the
 
03:06:53.830 --> 03:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
things I I I was in I was in uh New
 
03:06:55.750 --> 03:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
Orleans and they literally have
 
03:06:58.670 --> 03:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
dispensary District um Ubers that
 
03:07:01.389 --> 03:07:01.399 align:start position:0%
deliver your drugs for you right
 
03:07:03.469 --> 03:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
certainly do and so I want to make sure
 
03:07:05.790 --> 03:07:05.800 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire doesn't become that I
 
03:07:10.269 --> 03:07:10.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:12.110 --> 03:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
yeah all
 
03:07:16.710 --> 03:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
right all right so number um 17 and I
 
03:07:18.910 --> 03:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
guess I have a question on 17 and 19 is
 
03:07:20.309 --> 03:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
why would define youone an immature and
 
03:07:22.229 --> 03:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
a mature plan is if we're not dealing
 
03:07:23.790 --> 03:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
with cultivation anywhere else in there
 
03:07:26.429 --> 03:07:26.439 align:start position:0%
for hom growth I'm not sure we re
 
03:07:28.830 --> 03:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
utilize this language anywhere else and
 
03:07:32.510 --> 03:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
I I'd recommend striking number 17 and
 
03:07:41.630 --> 03:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:44.870 --> 03:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
that as we go through this uh please
 
03:07:46.630 --> 03:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
look for any unintended consequences by
 
03:07:47.990 --> 03:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
striking those if you see any other
 
03:07:50.750 --> 03:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
references to mature immature plants but
 
03:07:52.750 --> 03:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
I agree striking it's
 
03:07:57.550 --> 03:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:59.469 --> 03:07:59.479 align:start position:0%
inflation did we go to The Possession
 
03:08:01.349 --> 03:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
limits well we're we're above it we're
 
03:08:03.469 --> 03:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
in between this
 
03:08:06.349 --> 03:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
one KN glasses walking through so I'm
 
03:08:07.790 --> 03:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
not sure where this is used in the
 
03:08:09.150 --> 03:08:09.160 align:start position:0%
chapter I don't know why we have a
 
03:08:12.630 --> 03:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
definition of inflation but um I guess I
 
03:08:14.349 --> 03:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
don't I'm withhold comment until I see
 
03:08:16.269 --> 03:08:16.279 align:start position:0%
where else it's used in the bill I
 
03:08:18.110 --> 03:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
didn't see it anywhere but if it's not
 
03:08:20.750 --> 03:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
maybe we can strike it
 
03:08:23.550 --> 03:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
but yeah and if we didn't Define
 
03:08:28.269 --> 03:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
inflation in this chapter it's it's it's
 
03:08:30.309 --> 03:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
already defined by when you say
 
03:08:32.150 --> 03:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
inflation it has legal definition so it
 
03:08:34.469 --> 03:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
can be I think we'll take it out for now
 
03:08:36.030 --> 03:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
in the interest of trying to keep this
 
03:08:38.269 --> 03:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
under 100 pages and if we need to put it
 
03:08:40.870 --> 03:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
back in we understand where to find it
 
03:08:43.190 --> 03:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
number 20 municipality means the city
 
03:08:46.590 --> 03:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
town or an unincorporated place again I
 
03:08:48.110 --> 03:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
think this is rela to we use
 
03:08:50.229 --> 03:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities for two purposes further
 
03:08:52.469 --> 03:08:52.479 align:start position:0%
on in the statute we talk about who can
 
03:08:54.670 --> 03:08:54.680 align:start position:0%
authorize you know the the zoning and
 
03:08:57.309 --> 03:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
regul Regulatory stuff as well as we
 
03:08:59.269 --> 03:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
allow for some of the fees collected by
 
03:09:03.030 --> 03:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:06.150 --> 03:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
municipality number 21 any other comment
 
03:09:09.269 --> 03:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
we good there any uh 21 how late we
 
03:09:11.590 --> 03:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
going there how long you want to
 
03:09:15.110 --> 03:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
go I I can I I mean I can be here till 7
 
03:09:17.750 --> 03:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
o' but I see no one else want I'm not
 
03:09:19.030 --> 03:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
sure we're going to go that far but
 
03:09:20.309 --> 03:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
how's how's everyone doing so far
 
03:09:22.630 --> 03:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
everyone's brain's working good all
 
03:09:25.590 --> 03:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
right so number 21 possession
 
03:09:28.349 --> 03:09:28.359 align:start position:0%
limit cheap left on the most important
 
03:09:33.030 --> 03:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
part well I so I I I did talk speak
 
03:09:35.030 --> 03:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
privately and you know I'm not going to
 
03:09:36.990 --> 03:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
hold this to any any or we have another
 
03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:38.070 align:start position:0%
hold this to any any or we have another
Chief

03:09:38.070 --> 03:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
Chief
 
03:09:41.070 --> 03:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
here could would that person perhaps
 
03:09:46.469 --> 03:09:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:48.429 --> 03:09:48.439 align:start position:0%
are we allowed to do that sure
 
03:09:51.030 --> 03:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
yeah any problem with the chief
 
03:09:53.870 --> 03:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
replacement introduce
 
03:09:55.710 --> 03:09:55.720 align:start position:0%
yourself he's probably ready to go he
 
03:09:56.870 --> 03:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
probably ate lunch
 
03:09:59.670 --> 03:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
already like the rest of us certainly my
 
03:10:01.670 --> 03:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
name is Pat Sullivan I'm the executive
 
03:10:03.510 --> 03:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
director for the Chiefs Association I'm
 
03:10:06.590 --> 03:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
also retired Chief from
 
03:10:09.070 --> 03:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
gwn and thank you for joining us um
 
03:10:13.190 --> 03:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
possession limits my understanding is um
 
03:10:16.870 --> 03:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
there's some disagreement on that I know
 
03:10:19.389 --> 03:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
uh for cannabis products it says what's
 
03:10:25.229 --> 03:10:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:33.990 --> 03:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:37.229 --> 03:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
us so this is The Possession limits that
 
03:10:40.870 --> 03:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
not preserving it's if how much you have
 
03:10:53.429 --> 03:10:53.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:57.870 --> 03:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
it but how many 5.5 milligram squares of
 
03:11:00.830 --> 03:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
candy bars can one person legally own in
 
03:11:11.750 --> 03:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:11.760 --> 03:11:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
once

03:11:13.910 --> 03:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
once
 
03:11:16.269 --> 03:11:16.279 align:start position:0%
okay yeah how many of those candy bars
 
03:11:17.910 --> 03:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
then can you have is the question if
 
03:11:25.070 --> 03:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:27.429 --> 03:11:27.439 align:start position:0%
there if I want to walk into the store
 
03:11:30.710 --> 03:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
and buy every single candy bar and gummy
 
03:11:33.110 --> 03:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
off the shelf I would probably even
 
03:11:34.710 --> 03:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
exceed the
 
03:11:38.870 --> 03:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh the uh 2,000 milligrams I'm saying
 
03:11:41.229 --> 03:11:41.239 align:start position:0%
is how much am I legally allowed to
 
03:11:43.510 --> 03:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
possess without violating the law I is
 
03:11:46.630 --> 03:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
it unlimited is it no it's it's not uned
 
03:11:57.110 --> 03:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:00.510 --> 03:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
have this say 4 ounces for flour 20
 
03:12:02.510 --> 03:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
grams of concentrated
 
03:12:08.309 --> 03:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:12.990 --> 03:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
then M Mr chair does this possession um
 
03:12:15.870 --> 03:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
definition apply to people that are
 
03:12:18.229 --> 03:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
transporting it for
 
03:12:21.950 --> 03:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturers it wouldn't because that
 
03:12:23.389 --> 03:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
that would be this is this is your
 
03:12:24.990 --> 03:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
consumer right this goes back to the
 
03:12:26.469 --> 03:12:26.479 align:start position:0%
consumer definition so this is the
 
03:12:28.950 --> 03:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
person who walks in the store if they
 
03:12:31.309 --> 03:12:31.319 align:start position:0%
exceed a certain amount are they now
 
03:12:34.469 --> 03:12:34.479 align:start position:0%
eventually in violation of the
 
03:12:37.309 --> 03:12:37.319 align:start position:0%
law and I guess the question
 
03:12:40.550 --> 03:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
is so let's start with a right is
 
03:12:42.910 --> 03:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
everybody okay with a there any
 
03:12:44.710 --> 03:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
definition of a that's different
 
03:12:48.510 --> 03:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
Chief we're looking with a for 2 ounces
 
03:12:51.710 --> 03:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
of marijuana in the Cannabis or excuse
 
03:12:55.510 --> 03:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
me cannabis in the plant form so it's
 
03:12:57.830 --> 03:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
list four but we would go we we think
 
03:13:00.670 --> 03:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
two would be acceptable and reasonable I
 
03:13:03.469 --> 03:13:03.479 align:start position:0%
I think airing on the side of less is a
 
03:13:05.790 --> 03:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
good idea and the gentleman from Maine
 
03:13:07.309 --> 03:13:07.319 align:start position:0%
our friend from Maine just said that
 
03:13:10.030 --> 03:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
that uh two is what main he believed
 
03:13:10.040 --> 03:13:10.710 align:start position:0%
that uh two is what main he believed
what

03:13:10.710 --> 03:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:13:13.030 --> 03:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
main I ask a different question what
 
03:13:15.229 --> 03:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
what do we just set for a limit on
 
03:13:18.389 --> 03:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
decriminalization possession of how much
 
03:13:24.550 --> 03:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
75 I believe 75 Bal 75 of an oun
 
03:13:26.830 --> 03:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
commission yeah I mean just a couple
 
03:13:28.389 --> 03:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
things to flag here I mean I I think we
 
03:13:29.710 --> 03:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
would definitely prefer to keep it at
 
03:13:31.070 --> 03:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
four and I think if you look at this in
 
03:13:32.910 --> 03:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
the context of alcohol for example I can
 
03:13:35.190 --> 03:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
go in and buy as much whiskey as I want
 
03:13:37.070 --> 03:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
to buy and I think it's import the other
 
03:13:38.349 --> 03:13:38.359 align:start position:0%
important thing to remember is we have
 
03:13:41.309 --> 03:13:41.319 align:start position:0%
sales laws on the books and so if you if
 
03:13:43.790 --> 03:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
someone has 4 ounces and they're caught
 
03:13:45.950 --> 03:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
selling outside of the authorization
 
03:13:48.429 --> 03:13:48.439 align:start position:0%
this legislation they can be prosecuted
 
03:13:49.950 --> 03:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
for that because they're going outside
 
03:13:51.950 --> 03:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
the bounds but this is just personal
 
03:13:53.429 --> 03:13:53.439 align:start position:0%
possession I think we should that's
 
03:13:56.309 --> 03:13:56.319 align:start position:0%
totally fine to have 4 ounces um and if
 
03:13:57.910 --> 03:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
they're doing something illegal with
 
03:13:59.670 --> 03:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
that 4 ounces then there are multiple
 
03:14:01.630 --> 03:14:01.640 align:start position:0%
ways under current law for that person
 
03:14:03.110 --> 03:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
to be held accountable but I think it's
 
03:14:05.469 --> 03:14:05.479 align:start position:0%
just it's it's odd to kind of have that
 
03:14:08.070 --> 03:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
limit here but then with alcohol which
 
03:14:11.070 --> 03:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
is I think objectively more dangerous we
 
03:14:13.469 --> 03:14:13.479 align:start position:0%
have no no limits at all you can buy you
 
03:14:14.990 --> 03:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
know cases and cases and cases of
 
03:14:17.710 --> 03:14:17.720 align:start position:0%
whiskey without without concern so I
 
03:14:19.030 --> 03:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted to add I was just looking up
 
03:14:21.309 --> 03:14:21.319 align:start position:0%
what what Massachusetts is doing um you
 
03:14:23.070 --> 03:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
know to add to Maine and saying 1 ounce
 
03:14:26.070 --> 03:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
of flour five grams of concentrate
 
03:14:28.070 --> 03:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
compared to 20 we have here and 500
 
03:14:33.590 --> 03:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
milligrams of Edibles um versus 2,000
 
03:14:35.590 --> 03:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
milligrams what was what was the last
 
03:14:39.269 --> 03:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
one 500 yeah so it was 1 ounz of flour 5
 
03:14:41.990 --> 03:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
gram of concentrate and 500 milligrams
 
03:14:45.429 --> 03:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:48.630 --> 03:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
so I I would go with the 2 O myself if
 
03:14:50.150 --> 03:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's what our some of our surroundings
 
03:14:51.429 --> 03:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
are again you have remember we're
 
03:14:52.950 --> 03:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with people who may come from
 
03:14:54.590 --> 03:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to New Hampshire and have
 
03:14:57.150 --> 03:14:57.160 align:start position:0%
more than the 3/4 of an ounce possession
 
03:14:59.590 --> 03:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
limit we have now so I think erroring on
 
03:15:01.550 --> 03:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
the side of caution I think we we adjust
 
03:15:04.190 --> 03:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
to two it keeps it consistent with Maine
 
03:15:07.429 --> 03:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
uh semi consistent with Massachusetts um
 
03:15:09.110 --> 03:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
and so we don't have these tourists that
 
03:15:10.670 --> 03:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
are coming in that are becoming
 
03:15:12.630 --> 03:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
accidental criminals because of their
 
03:15:13.990 --> 03:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
possession limit in their state slightly
 
03:15:15.190 --> 03:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
more than a possession limit in our
 
03:15:16.469 --> 03:15:16.479 align:start position:0%
state if I could ask our good friends
 
03:15:18.309 --> 03:15:18.319 align:start position:0%
some mean one
 
03:15:21.510 --> 03:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
question you can point at someone else
 
03:15:24.870 --> 03:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
but realistically when a consumer comes
 
03:15:26.950 --> 03:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
in the store how often do they buy what
 
03:15:28.910 --> 03:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
a consumer and I'm just just speculating
 
03:15:30.110 --> 03:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
how often do they actually buy The
 
03:15:30.120 --> 03:15:35.870 align:start position:0%
how often do they actually buy The
Possession

03:15:35.870 --> 03:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:38.349 --> 03:15:38.359 align:start position:0%
limit I'm sorry if if someone's going to
 
03:15:39.510 --> 03:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
speak to the commission they should
 
03:15:41.030 --> 03:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
speak into the microphone just for the
 
03:15:47.110 --> 03:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:49.950 --> 03:15:49.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh what was the question
 
03:15:53.110 --> 03:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
again I in your in your experience I
 
03:15:54.630 --> 03:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
understand that you're speculating or
 
03:15:56.229 --> 03:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
making an estimate how often do
 
03:15:58.950 --> 03:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
consumers come into the store in Maine
 
03:16:01.510 --> 03:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
which has 2 and a half ounce flow limit
 
03:16:03.550 --> 03:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
yeah how often a consumer is actually
 
03:16:06.229 --> 03:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
purchasing that 2 and a half ounce limit
 
03:16:08.830 --> 03:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
well first of all we don't sell it in
 
03:16:12.630 --> 03:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
ounces right 80% of what we sell we sell
 
03:16:16.750 --> 03:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
in 1/8 ounce jars so you know an eigh
 
03:16:20.110 --> 03:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
ounce jar is about 40 bucks retail okay
 
03:16:22.670 --> 03:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
so how much do they we do it on how much
 
03:16:25.429 --> 03:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
they normally spend we have two ATMs in
 
03:16:27.990 --> 03:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
there and we Trace everything and it it
 
03:16:30.910 --> 03:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
averages about $80 a customer is there
 
03:16:33.189 --> 03:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
people that go in there and spend 500 or
 
03:16:35.870 --> 03:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
700 bucks yeah they're they're
 
03:16:38.670 --> 03:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely is you know but generally
 
03:16:40.389 --> 03:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
speaking the average customer is
 
03:16:42.990 --> 03:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
spending $80 out of out of customers how
 
03:16:45.750 --> 03:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
much would you say are going to buy well
 
03:16:48.830 --> 03:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
give me a level to spend more than $200
 
03:16:50.910 --> 03:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
and a visit no this has to do with the
 
03:16:52.469 --> 03:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
amount you not how much money you're
 
03:16:54.790 --> 03:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
spending it's the amount you you can
 
03:16:58.550 --> 03:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
legally possess all right if it's 4
 
03:17:00.710 --> 03:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
ounces it's higher than Maine but if we
 
03:17:02.349 --> 03:17:02.359 align:start position:0%
made it two and a half like main I'm
 
03:17:04.790 --> 03:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
just asking as we debate whether it
 
03:17:07.429 --> 03:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
should be 2 ounces three four whatever
 
03:17:08.830 --> 03:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just asking how often is someone
 
03:17:10.910 --> 03:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
coming in even buying that large of a
 
03:17:13.070 --> 03:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
amount of flower uh on a reg on a
 
03:17:15.469 --> 03:17:15.479 align:start position:0%
regular basis you know it happens a lot
 
03:17:17.309 --> 03:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
especially because we're we're um in an
 
03:17:19.309 --> 03:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
area where there's a lot of vacationers
 
03:17:20.870 --> 03:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
and they're not necessarily in legal
 
03:17:22.710 --> 03:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
states so they come and they they'll buy
 
03:17:24.990 --> 03:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
stuff to bring home with them so you
 
03:17:27.469 --> 03:17:27.479 align:start position:0%
know so it's it's a reg for somebody to
 
03:17:30.229 --> 03:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
spend $2 $300 I'd say two or three an
 
03:17:33.750 --> 03:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
hour do that someone to spend
 
03:17:37.469 --> 03:17:37.479 align:start position:0%
$500 few a few one every few few days
 
03:17:40.110 --> 03:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
someone to spend $1,000 I don't think
 
03:17:42.750 --> 03:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
I've ever seen that I've never seen
 
03:17:45.630 --> 03:17:45.640 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair again I'm just looking for
 
03:17:47.189 --> 03:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
consistency across the board in our
 
03:17:50.590 --> 03:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis program it's 2 ounces
 
03:17:53.870 --> 03:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
so it's it creates a consistent law
 
03:17:55.790 --> 03:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
across the board whether in a medical or
 
03:17:57.670 --> 03:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
in regulatory you have a 2 ounce limit
 
03:18:00.510 --> 03:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
of possession but this stuff is stronger
 
03:18:02.750 --> 03:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
higher potency than what the consumer
 
03:18:03.750 --> 03:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
product we have no idea what the
 
03:18:04.990 --> 03:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
consumer product looks like yet we
 
03:18:07.910 --> 03:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:11.389 --> 03:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
well again in in our law from what I'm
 
03:18:13.349 --> 03:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
looking at it says a patient can possess
 
03:18:16.550 --> 03:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
no more than two ounces of
 
03:18:19.910 --> 03:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
of it says unusable which I don't
 
03:18:21.950 --> 03:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
understand why but a
 
03:18:24.910 --> 03:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis but um again it's 2 ounces for
 
03:18:27.309 --> 03:18:27.319 align:start position:0%
the purposes of plant material in our in
 
03:18:28.910 --> 03:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
our statute and that's usually a law
 
03:18:31.030 --> 03:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement views it is in ounces and
 
03:18:34.469 --> 03:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
pounds and kilos what what is the price
 
03:18:39.189 --> 03:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
of 2 ounces of of product don't sell
 
03:18:42.830 --> 03:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
okay could we do a conversion a an e
 
03:18:45.309 --> 03:18:45.319 align:start position:0%
ounce jars well it's 40 for an A so
 
03:18:48.830 --> 03:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
that's three 320 for an ounce but again
 
03:18:52.309 --> 03:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
it's not the same as buying volum buy
 
03:18:54.630 --> 03:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
different JS
 
03:18:57.389 --> 03:18:57.399 align:start position:0%
different so 320 an ounce so you're
 
03:18:59.910 --> 03:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
looking at 640 you just said maybe one
 
03:19:03.670 --> 03:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
person a week would spend 640 so $640 an
 
03:19:08.469 --> 03:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:10.870 --> 03:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
320 the black market would take over the
 
03:19:13.710 --> 03:19:13.720 align:start position:0%
industry if they sold at that
 
03:19:20.630 --> 03:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:26.030 --> 03:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:29.870 --> 03:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
less all right so my so Mr chair on on
 
03:19:33.590 --> 03:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
11 Dave I think we just we just heard
 
03:19:37.150 --> 03:19:37.160 align:start position:0%
from the medical experts and uh they
 
03:19:39.910 --> 03:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
talk about how youth are getting the
 
03:19:41.790 --> 03:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
product and they're getting it from
 
03:19:44.269 --> 03:19:44.279 align:start position:0%
people people buying marijuana for them
 
03:19:47.429 --> 03:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
I think we should be below a better
 
03:19:49.710 --> 03:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
where somebody can't go place an order
 
03:19:52.150 --> 03:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
and go buy it for for youth I think it
 
03:19:54.189 --> 03:19:54.199 align:start position:0%
makes more sense from a public health
 
03:19:58.070 --> 03:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
standpoint so mass is one main is two I
 
03:19:59.269 --> 03:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
think Main's two and a half two and a
 
03:20:02.830 --> 03:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
half and our our medical is two so my
 
03:20:04.670 --> 03:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be we change a to 2
 
03:20:08.670 --> 03:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
ounces B to five grams and C to 500
 
03:20:10.550 --> 03:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
milligrams the last two at the doctor's
 
03:20:12.950 --> 03:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation and I think that that
 
03:20:15.469 --> 03:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
keeps consistency across our laws can I
 
03:20:18.710 --> 03:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
I with Senator L all right I from a
 
03:20:20.229 --> 03:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
public listen I understand that I just
 
03:20:22.670 --> 03:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
want one thing to be considered here and
 
03:20:24.269 --> 03:20:24.279 align:start position:0%
I've asked this question and I never can
 
03:20:26.910 --> 03:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
get an answer but I'm ask it again in
 
03:20:29.229 --> 03:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
the prior Recreation bills I would see
 
03:20:31.269 --> 03:20:31.279 align:start position:0%
it had like I think it said 1 ounce I
 
03:20:33.710 --> 03:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
forget what it said for grams whatever
 
03:20:35.950 --> 03:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
these stores are only selling limited
 
03:20:39.550 --> 03:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
products and in New Hampshire we make a
 
03:20:43.189 --> 03:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
lot of our sales and Retail comes
 
03:20:47.550 --> 03:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
from out ofate consumers buying in bulk
 
03:20:49.229 --> 03:20:49.239 align:start position:0%
I think our liquor sales is a large
 
03:20:50.950 --> 03:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
percentage go to out of state now I
 
03:20:53.830 --> 03:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
don't think I maybe 4 ounces is too much
 
03:20:57.070 --> 03:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
but I'm s part of a lot of the consumer
 
03:20:59.469 --> 03:20:59.479 align:start position:0%
models in retail not even reference to
 
03:21:02.630 --> 03:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
just cannabis relies on people coming
 
03:21:04.910 --> 03:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
here whether it's for vacation or coming
 
03:21:06.910 --> 03:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
over the board in the weekend and buying
 
03:21:10.429 --> 03:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
in bulk so and the these numbers here
 
03:21:14.229 --> 03:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
which I you when I put together 1598 was
 
03:21:16.389 --> 03:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
kind of throwing them around Loosely
 
03:21:17.990 --> 03:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
explaining that part of the revenue
 
03:21:20.429 --> 03:21:20.439 align:start position:0%
model is that we sell a lot the a ofate
 
03:21:23.510 --> 03:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
consumers now if you only can buy a
 
03:21:25.990 --> 03:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
certain amount I was concerned that a
 
03:21:28.070 --> 03:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
private retailer is that even enough for
 
03:21:29.990 --> 03:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
them to stay in business if they only
 
03:21:31.990 --> 03:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
can sell one ounce or two ounces no one
 
03:21:34.750 --> 03:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
seems to know the answer for that so if
 
03:21:37.030 --> 03:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
the business is going to rely on the
 
03:21:40.070 --> 03:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
franchisee model relies on the out of
 
03:21:41.630 --> 03:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
state consumers buying in bulk I mean we
 
03:21:43.870 --> 03:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
have have to make it even now that
 
03:21:45.110 --> 03:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we open the floodgates and
 
03:21:48.429 --> 03:21:48.439 align:start position:0%
make it 4 ounces but by making it two
 
03:21:53.349 --> 03:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
five and 500 are we limiting our our I
 
03:21:55.030 --> 03:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
guess hurting the franchise
 
03:21:57.150 --> 03:21:57.160 align:start position:0%
model that's a loaded that's a very
 
03:22:00.790 --> 03:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
loaded question I just ask so now I'm
 
03:22:02.510 --> 03:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
not saying it's responsible to make it
 
03:22:04.550 --> 03:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
what it is today what it says here for
 
03:22:07.590 --> 03:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's a large amount but but if
 
03:22:08.990 --> 03:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
we if the system's not going to be
 
03:22:11.110 --> 03:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
viable the franchise model because we
 
03:22:12.269 --> 03:22:12.279 align:start position:0%
lose the bulk
 
03:22:17.950 --> 03:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:20.309 --> 03:22:20.319 align:start position:0%
happens I think having the fail systems
 
03:22:23.910 --> 03:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:26.349 --> 03:22:26.359 align:start position:0%
amount which is why these numbers be
 
03:22:28.670 --> 03:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
when I put these large numbers together
 
03:22:30.429 --> 03:22:30.439 align:start position:0%
as you can tell I'm not really a fan of
 
03:22:32.710 --> 03:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
the numbers but the idea was to make the
 
03:22:36.670 --> 03:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
system viable in Max your outstate sales
 
03:22:38.389 --> 03:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
and I think liquor out ofate sales is
 
03:22:44.150 --> 03:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:45.870 --> 03:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
I understand that this is a tough pill
 
03:22:48.630 --> 03:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
to swallow for some of us I you
 
03:22:49.630 --> 03:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
understand the pl that I'm making I'm
 
03:22:52.269 --> 03:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
not saying and I so I think there's a
 
03:22:54.229 --> 03:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
lot to consider here we're also almost
 
03:22:56.110 --> 03:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
at 1:30 we've been here since 10: no
 
03:22:57.710 --> 03:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
one's eaten lunch so maybe we need to
 
03:23:00.309 --> 03:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
settle on that question just percolate a
 
03:23:01.189 --> 03:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
03:23:03.469 --> 03:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
more and everyone's giving me a ster
 
03:23:06.510 --> 03:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
like I'm crazy I mean well right I think
 
03:23:09.830 --> 03:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
people are tired I am I'm hungry there's
 
03:23:11.830 --> 03:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
only so much we can ask commissioners
 
03:23:14.469 --> 03:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
just finish we'll just finish everyone's
 
03:23:17.070 --> 03:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
uh I agree with my colleague a good
 
03:23:21.269 --> 03:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
friend uh uses the halt hungry know
 
03:23:21.279 --> 03:23:23.309 align:start position:0%
friend uh uses the halt hungry know
tired

03:23:23.309 --> 03:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
tired
 
03:23:26.309 --> 03:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
yeah so suggesting s when he hungry
 
03:23:28.469 --> 03:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
tired and angry or just I mean I think
 
03:23:30.150 --> 03:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
this is an important question we want I
 
03:23:31.790 --> 03:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
would like to percolate on it a little
 
03:23:34.550 --> 03:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
bit more maybe we kind of rest on that
 
03:23:40.429 --> 03:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:50.070 --> 03:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:53.590 --> 03:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:55.630 --> 03:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
Friday is everyone good on Friday the
 
03:23:57.389 --> 03:23:57.399 align:start position:0%
third I I have a call in the morning but
 
03:23:58.630 --> 03:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
you guys I'm sure would love to care
 
03:24:01.830 --> 03:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
about me you talk about the third yeah
 
03:24:02.990 --> 03:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
oh I don't have that I don't have that
 
03:24:04.670 --> 03:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
in my calendar but I think the senator
 
03:24:06.990 --> 03:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
was mentioning that there's a conflict
 
03:24:10.590 --> 03:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:10.600 --> 03:24:19.990 align:start position:0%
 
would

03:24:19.990 --> 03:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:25.670 --> 03:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:27.790 --> 03:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
third so we're doing a third at 10
 
03:24:27.800 --> 03:24:29.309 align:start position:0%
third so we're doing a third at 10
o'clock

03:24:29.309 --> 03:24:29.319 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
03:24:39.030 --> 03:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:41.070 --> 03:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
okay so we're going to stop on we're
 
03:24:42.429 --> 03:24:42.439 align:start position:0%
going to stop on possession limit
 
03:24:44.070 --> 03:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
everyone go home think about it come
 
03:24:48.070 --> 03:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
back uh Chief uh uh uh commissioner de
 
03:24:49.550 --> 03:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
Miker if you could just take a look at
 
03:24:52.670 --> 03:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
the to the chair's point of how does
 
03:24:55.150 --> 03:24:55.160 align:start position:0%
bulk sales impact your idea of a model
 
03:24:56.469 --> 03:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
and what that looks like so we can have
 
03:24:58.349 --> 03:24:58.359 align:start position:0%
that part of the discussion whether
 
03:25:00.830 --> 03:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
increasing possession limits for the pur
 
03:25:03.910 --> 03:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
purposes of sale um I what that looks
 
03:25:05.389 --> 03:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
like and come back with that on a
 
03:25:07.670 --> 03:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
revenue model what that might be and
 
03:25:09.750 --> 03:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
then Dave remember you're bringing chap
 
03:25:11.590 --> 03:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
that section three of the funding
 
03:25:13.950 --> 03:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
formula to talk about alcohol the
 
03:25:15.790 --> 03:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
Alcohol and Other Drug fund for
 
03:25:17.150 --> 03:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
treatment and the doctor you have your
 
03:25:17.160 --> 03:25:18.670 align:start position:0%
treatment and the doctor you have your
homework

03:25:18.670 --> 03:25:18.680 align:start position:0%
homework
 
03:25:21.429 --> 03:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
assignment and with that we're
 
03:25:34.990 --> 03:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:37.710 --> 03:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
adjourned cultivation and Manufacturing
 
03:25:40.830 --> 03:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
retail licenses on this you need to give
 
03:26:10.389 --> 03:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:10.399 --> 03:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
 
should
