00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
the revenue is associated with senate
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
bill three
 
00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
the revenues associated with ppp funds
 
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
and the revenues associated
 
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
with the other
 
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
stimulus packages in order to be able to
 
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.790 align:start position:0%
stimulus packages in order to be able to
determine

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
determine
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
which are potential candidates for
 
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
refunding in the future
 
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
if if we pass senate bill 3
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
and also which are the ones associated
 
00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:22.790 align:start position:0%
and also which are the ones associated
with

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
the additional stimulus packages
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
so that they
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
the bulk of that might be considered as
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
one-time revenue
 
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:36.970 align:start position:0%
so melissa
 
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.150 align:start position:0%
so melissa
[Music]

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
melissa or carolyn would you be able to
 
00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
see i'm muted i'm sorry um i can kick us
 
00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:54.469 align:start position:0%
see i'm muted i'm sorry um i can kick us
off

00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
off
 
00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
i think i'll start um with
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
um your question about the impact of
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
ppp um first
 
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
and to begin i just want to um
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
sort of step back for a minute
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
and talk about what we are
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
seeing and what we expect to see
 
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
for tax revenue
 
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
under current law as it relates
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
to forgiven tpp loans
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
um so as you'll recall when commissioner
 
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.469 align:start position:0%
um so as you'll recall when commissioner
stepp

00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
stepp
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
um initially testified on this bill
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
under current law for given ppp
 
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
loans are included in
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
revenue as taxable income
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
but to the extent that ppp loan is used
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
to pay for business expenses
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
it also is a deduction so for the most
 
00:08:59.040 --> 00:08:59.829 align:start position:0%
it also is a deduction so for the most
part

00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
part
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
what we expect to see under
 
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
current law is no real impact
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
on revenue from forgiven ppp loans
 
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
because it's our belief
 
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
and i think you've heard testimony to
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
confirm that
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
that based on the economic conditions as
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
well as the terms of the ppp
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
program most ppp money
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
was spent on normal business expenses
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
so they'll include the revenue and
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
income but then they'll deduct it all
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
out again to account for those expenses
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
and that's really reflected in what we
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
see in
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
on returns to date
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
so we queried um returns
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
received to date and taxpayers have
 
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
reported about 5.4 million
 
00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:55.519 align:start position:0%
in ppp revenue and what they're
 
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
reporting to us
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
is that portion of forgiven ppp loan
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
that they did not
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
spend on deductible expenses so that
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
number is very small
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
and that's what we would expect to see
 
00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:10.310 align:start position:0%
and that's what we would expect to see
because

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
our expectation is that businesses used
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
that money
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
for um for business expenses
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
um however because
 
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
we have such a large number of
 
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.829 align:start position:0%
we have such a large number of
extensions

00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
extensions
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
um this year we are also
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
missing a lot of data so we think that
 
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.190 align:start position:0%
missing a lot of data so we think that
that

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
5.4 million relates to
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
about 8 of the total number
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
of forms that we
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
um expected to receive for
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
calendar year 2020 tax filers those
 
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
returns won't come in
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
until the fall um so there is sort of a
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
lack of data
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
for us to affirmatively say
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
that the revenue we've received to date
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
attributable to ppp is small
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact of senate bill 3
 
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
is less about losing revenue
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
we expected to receive and is
 
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:19.240 align:start position:0%
more about allowing
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
expenses um when you're not
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
requiring the taxpayer to also recognize
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
the income
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
that was used to pay those expenses
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
so the fiscal impact of sb3 is really
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
the fact that you under senate bill 3
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
you would you would not include the
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
forgiven ppp loan in income
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
but you would still allow that expense
 
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
and then that expense because it's not
 
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.310 align:start position:0%
and then that expense because it's not
offsetting

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
offsetting
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
the ppp for given loan is going to
 
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.550 align:start position:0%
the ppp for given loan is going to
offset

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
offset
 
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise taxable income of that
 
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.230 align:start position:0%
otherwise taxable income of that
taxpayer

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
um you have
 
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact of of that
 
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
um that that policy decision
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
um all in it's about 100 million dollars
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
and we're working now to do our best to
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
come up with
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
um a meaningful methodology for
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
um trying to spread that out acro across
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal years
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
um so that if you do proceed with senate
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
bill 3 you'll have a better sense of how
 
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
to account for it
 
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
um probably there it makes sense for me
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
questions from the members of
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative rodney are you muted
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
there thank you mr chair is there a um
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
issue with the timing of
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
when they take the deduction
 
00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
for expense and the versus
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
taking uh for the forgiven revenue is
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
not taxable
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
is that an issue i mean can they take
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
can they take the deduction for the for
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
the expense
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
before a tax year
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
before uh the loan is forgiven when the
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
loan is forgiven
 
00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
then they they can take the
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
the uh reduce the the revenue by the
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
amount of the forgiven
 
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
revenue follow i'm saying
 
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
so yes i i do understand and i think
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
our expectation um
 
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:49.839 align:start position:0%
is that taxpayers reported
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
those expenses which under current law
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
are deductible in um
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
in the calendar year that they were
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
incurred so they should have for
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
calendar year file or should have been
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
reported in calendar year
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
2020 um they would have
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
included the expenses um but
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
presumably not included the revenue
 
00:14:17.839 --> 00:14:18.389 align:start position:0%
presumably not included the revenue
until

00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
until
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
actually forgiven um what we know
 
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
is that um and i think what you heard
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
from the cpas
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
is i think taxpayers have been taking
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
different positions
 
00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
on this issue there was some irs
 
00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:34.550 align:start position:0%
on this issue there was some irs
guidance

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
um that indicated that taxpayers should
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
treat um a
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
ppp loan as forgiven if they
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
reasonably expected
 
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
that loan to be forgiven even if it
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
hadn't yet been forgiven yet
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
and so in some instances i believe
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
taxpayers did follow that treatment
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire purposes and did
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
report both the expenses
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
and the income on their 2020 return when
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
they filed it
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
but as you heard from the cpas they at
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
least some of them have advised
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
their clients to not count the people
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
the forgiveness
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
loan until actually forgiven um and in
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
that instance there would be a
 
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.910 align:start position:0%
that instance there would be a
disconnect

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
disconnect
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
between the expenses and um
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
the revenue
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers had
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
if they had an expectation that they
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
would be forgiven
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
would report in their federal taxes
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
that it is forgiven but
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
it never had any instructions relative
 
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:45.829 align:start position:0%
it never had any instructions relative
to

00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
the state tax is that correct that's
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
correct and i think that's why there's
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
probably a disconnect
 
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
with um what we thought we were going to
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
see because generally our expectation
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
is that on timing issues like that
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers follow the feds
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
um but i think you're absolutely right
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
there was no directive from us
 
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
to follow that federal guidance
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
and from what i hear from accountants
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
they uh recommended
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
to file using current law rather than
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
some as assuming such as the other fed
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
said that
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
okay and so unfortunately that
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
that disconnect and that different
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
treatment among
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and cpas unfortunately makes
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
the situation more uncertain
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
as it relates to that timing question
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.839 --> 00:16:51.590 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you had to get to my mute button
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
um so this is really hard to
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
get a handle on um the
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
situation where a taxpayer
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 20 takes
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
has taken a deduction for the expenses
 
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.189 align:start position:0%
has taken a deduction for the expenses
that

00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
related to the ppp loan
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
and subsequently in a subsequent tax
 
00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.909 align:start position:0%
and subsequently in a subsequent tax
year

00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
what i'm wondering about is is this
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
what will that and all the other
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
taxpayers like that
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
um do
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh will they will they be seeking a
 
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.950 align:start position:0%
uh will they will they be seeking a
refund

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
um how does this go
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
um we'll still be allowed
 
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
so yep yeah
 
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
so if a taxpayer both
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
um under current law
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
took the deduction and paid the tax
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
in calendar year 2020 um
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
that would result in a refund
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
if senate bill 3 was passed
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
if a taxpayer took the deduction
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
in 2020 but doesn't
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't claim the income until the loan
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
is actually forgiven in a later year
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
that will result
 
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay well i'll leave it there for now
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
uh representative romney yeah i guess
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
because and sp3
 
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
both the the the
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
expense can be deducted in both cases
 
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.590 align:start position:0%
expense can be deducted in both cases
yeah

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
that's the issue it's it's the revenue
 
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:18.870 align:start position:0%
that's the issue it's it's the revenue
part

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
part
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
the forgiveness part of the revenue so
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's where i see the timing issue
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
that one can happen without the other
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
and i guess there's no clear answer on
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
on it other
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
understand that that's the case and the
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
degree to which that happens
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
it depends on how people are filing i
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
guess is that correct
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right representative
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
in that case they could file an amended
 
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.950 align:start position:0%
in that case they could file an amended
return

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
return
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
or declare
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
less taxes owed in their fy 2021
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
tax i would assume if sv3 is
 
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
passed you will have both refunds
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
and just taxpayers paying less
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
depending on what they did in their 2020
 
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:16.630 align:start position:0%
depending on what they did in their 2020
year

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
representative spellsbury thank you mr
 
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.190 align:start position:0%
representative spellsbury thank you mr
chairman

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
um as i understand
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
the position being taken by
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
accountants and clients advocating sp3
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
it tends to center i think on the
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
a situation where they have reported
 
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.430 align:start position:0%
a situation where they have reported
expenses

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
in 2020. they they already
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
feel like they've whether they've
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
reported or not they've
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
made their estimated payments and
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
they've done their accounting for the
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
2020 liability
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
if there was any and now they're
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
concerned that the forgiveness will
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
occur in 21
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
and that if we don't pass sb3
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's going to create a cash um
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
flow uh
 
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
difficulty uh because they
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
you know they've said repeatedly it
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
didn't set
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
cash aside they spent all of the money
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
that came from ppp
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
on expenses now i'm actually i'm having
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
taking the argument very seriously i see
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
i see this
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
the timing issue but are there
 
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.110 align:start position:0%
the timing issue but are there
provisions

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
in our current uh business profits tax
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
which i don't know
 
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
intimately that allows them to
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
carry forward uh excess losses from one
 
00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.350 align:start position:0%
carry forward uh excess losses from one
year

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh to the next year so that any uh
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
income that is not recognized until
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
forgiven in 21
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
can be offset with losses
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
that were not fully absorbed in 20
 
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
or if if that is not currently possible
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
could we further tweak our amendment
 
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
by allowing on the basis of the pandemic
 
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.310 align:start position:0%
by allowing on the basis of the pandemic
having

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
lasted for more than a year and having
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
carried over two different tax years
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
a one-time provision that just says
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
any expenses or losses incurred in 20
 
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
can be offset against income generated
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
in 21.
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right representative so i
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
melissa can jump in if i'm
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
getting it wrong but i believe new
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire allows the carry forward of
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
prior year losses for 10 years
 
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
so that would certainly capture um
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
an instance where the taxpayer deducted
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
expenses um in 2020
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
well thank you for clarifying that that
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
that means we don't even need
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
to further change the bill or the
 
00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:12.149 align:start position:0%
to further change the bill or the
amendment

00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
um and i've gone back
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
and very carefully re-read
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
each letter that i've received from a
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
business taxpayer and accountant
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
and i honestly i read closely
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think their argument is sound at
 
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.830 align:start position:0%
i don't think their argument is sound at
all

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
and when i carefully
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
parse what's being said in
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
the mason and rich letter and the
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
various other letters we've received
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
they just don't hold water and if if the
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
if the idea is that it uh
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
that it's an anomaly of timing i think
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
that the tax loss carry forward
 
00:23:57.279 --> 00:23:58.870 align:start position:0%
that the tax loss carry forward
completely

00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
completely
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
any comment on that uh carolyn
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
it's not no
 
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
representative murphy thank you mr
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
chairman just a point of clarification
 
00:24:18.559 --> 00:24:20.310 align:start position:0%
chairman just a point of clarification
carolyn

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
carolyn
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
is it right that most of the businesses
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
declared the
 
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
expense uh deduction in 20
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
but they had the option of filing
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
the ppp dollars as income either in 20
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
or in 21 they could do it either year is
 
00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
we would have accepted it we would have
 
00:24:41.039 --> 00:24:41.830 align:start position:0%
we would have accepted it we would have
accepted

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
accepted
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers decision to report
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
ppp loans in both 20 or 21
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
um based on that irs guidance telling
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
them to treat
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
the loan as forgiven even if not yet
 
00:24:57.669 --> 00:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
technically forgiven
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
so yes the answer to your question is
 
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
just yeah i was just wondering also do
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
you know and i've heard from some
 
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
businesses up here that they receive
 
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
the ppp dollars
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
as a loan um and then maybe forgiven
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
but they felt that there were changes
 
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
made by congress and the feds and
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
they decided to return the dollars
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
basically do you know the magnitude of
 
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
businesses that have returned to dollars
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
i do not know that representative okay
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
further questions before the dra
 
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.710 align:start position:0%
further questions before the dra
continues

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
continues
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything so the melissa or
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
carolyn so i think the other
 
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
question that you were hoping that we
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
would address
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
a bit is um this
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
concept of the 175 million that were
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
currently over
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
planned and how much of that
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
is attributable just more generally to
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
all of the various
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
stimulus programs are you ready for me
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
yes that would be very helpful to be
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
able to differentiate
 
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
you can't come up with exact numbers
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
but that 175 million dollars
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
could be is to me is made up of two
 
00:26:32.159 --> 00:26:33.669 align:start position:0%
could be is to me is made up of two
things

00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
is the ppp loans once they're forgiven
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to be sent back as
 
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.750 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to be sent back as
refunds

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
refunds
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
and the other is the other stimulus
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
things that stimulated the economy
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
generated profits
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
of a one time nature because once the
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
pandemic is over it's not going to be
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
there again
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
so of that 175 what percentage of that
 
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
can i just interject first for a second
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh when we say when we say 175 it's
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
really the 175 minus the 18 correct
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
yes so it's more like uh 157 we're
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
correct right and
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
that could grow the idea here is
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
it's there's also of the 175 not only
 
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
is it the uh the 18 point sometime
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
but the normal growth
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
that would need to be taken out
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
and what remains is associated with ppp
 
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.669 align:start position:0%
and what remains is associated with ppp
loans

00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
loans
 
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
and the other stimulus packages that
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
those of you who um
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
listen to us talk about revenues and
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
estimating revenues
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
have definitely heard us talk before
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
about the concept
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
of removing anomalies from the
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
the tax base before trying to predict
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
you know subsequent year revenues and i
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
think the real
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
struggle with fiscal year 2021
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
is going to be that you have
 
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
many anomalies and two really big
 
00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.470 align:start position:0%
many anomalies and two really big
anomalies

00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
anomalies
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
you have the um
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
anomaly of the pandemic itself right
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
the the pandemic certainly reduced
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
revenues um in an
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
anomalous fashion during fiscal year
 
00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:17.990 align:start position:0%
anomalous fashion during fiscal year
2021

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
2021
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
and at the same time you have the
 
00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.230 align:start position:0%
and at the same time you have the
stimulus

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
stimulus
 
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
and its impacts on revenues which
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
anomalously impacts revenues in the
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
opposite direction
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
um you know the stimulus was really
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
meant to offset
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
the anomalous impact
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
of covid on the economy and so the
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
challenge becomes um how would you
 
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
adjust the fiscal year 21
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
base to account for both that negative
 
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:52.950 align:start position:0%
base to account for both that negative
anomaly

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
anomaly
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
and the positive anomaly or do you just
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
assume that they sort of cancel each
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
other out
 
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
from a data-driven standpoint
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
you know the department doesn't have a
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
data to sort of
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
really suss out the competing effects of
 
00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:21.510 align:start position:0%
really suss out the competing effects of
those

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
two anomalies on fiscal year 21 revenue
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
um you know certainly all of the
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
stimulus money
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
that has flowed into the economy in the
 
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
form of you know
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
grants to businesses and
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
enhanced unemployment benefits and you
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
know the direct
 
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
to individual stimulus payments from the
 
00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.990 align:start position:0%
to individual stimulus payments from the
irs

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
irs
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
all of those things flowing into the
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
economy have
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
certainly caused business taxes to be
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
higher than they would have been
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
if those stimulus programs hadn't
 
00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.630 align:start position:0%
if those stimulus programs hadn't
existed

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
but by how much um
 
00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
you know we've thought on that question
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
and i'm not really sure
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
we have data to give you a figure
 
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
of how much of that 175 million
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
can really be attributable to
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know the massive amount of stimulus
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
money that's flowed into the economy
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
i think that's also compounded you know
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
our lack of information is also
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
compounded by the fact
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
that um most of our taxpayers
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
and certainly most of our largest
 
00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:36.070 align:start position:0%
and certainly most of our largest
taxpayers

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
elect to file on extension so at this
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
point in the year
 
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
we have presumably all their money
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
but no information about what that money
 
00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.549 align:start position:0%
but no information about what that money
means

00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
we won't have the information about what
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
that money means
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
until they actually file their returns
 
00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.269 align:start position:0%
until they actually file their returns
in

00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
october and november of this year um so
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
that certainly exacerbates
 
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
um your challenge and our challenge
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
in trying to figure out you know any
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
helpful information about that 175
 
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars that we are above or to
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
representative abrami's point really 155
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
million that were above
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
um planned this year and then
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
just to finish i'd add to that um
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of tax law changes
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
that are taking place this year as well
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
i mean i think a good example is that um
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
irc conformity last year
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
was really first year that we were all
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
in on internal revenue code conformity
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
to the um tax cuts and jobs act and we
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
estimated the amount of revenue we
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
thought conformity would generate
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
um it could we could have been wrong we
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
could have been
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
low and so some of that revenue could be
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
attributable to internal revenue code
 
00:33:05.039 --> 00:33:06.549 align:start position:0%
attributable to internal revenue code
conformity

00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
conformity
 
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
again we won't know until we get all the
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
returns in
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
and then this is the first year of
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing this year
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
which is a huge unknown as it relates to
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
revenue so certainly
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
estimate payments that we've received to
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
date this year
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
could be impacted by market-based
 
00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:25.830 align:start position:0%
could be impacted by market-based
sourcing

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
sourcing
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
being new with that
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
i think i'll pause give melissa the
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to jump in if she has
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
anything to add or otherwise we can
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
field some questions
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
no carolyn i think you did a great job
 
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
questions at this point representative
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
romney and followed by representative
 
00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.350 align:start position:0%
romney and followed by representative
alani

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
alani
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
um can you give us a sense of uh
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
how you brought up market-based sourcing
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
and this is the first year
 
00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
of how we're doing finding those
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
companies that are service companies
 
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.830 align:start position:0%
companies that are service companies
providing

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
providing
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
service to new hampshire that we can tax
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
that was the big issue when we talked
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
about market-based sourcing
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
how long would it take for us to
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
identify businesses
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
that don't volunteer to pay the tax to
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire versus the other way
 
00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.389 align:start position:0%
new hampshire versus the other way
around

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
great question so at this point mark
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
took effect on 1-1 20-21
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
so the only thing we would have expected
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
to receive
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
to date is one quarterly estimate
 
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:33.669 align:start position:0%
to date is one quarterly estimate
payment

00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
payment
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
from calendar year filers um
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry um and so at this point
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
you're really in a voluntary compliance
 
00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.829 align:start position:0%
you're really in a voluntary compliance
position

00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
we won't start our investigatory work
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
and our audit work really until we don't
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
receive returns next spring and fall
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's really the timing of our
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
compliance activity what we've received
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
to date will just be those
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that have voluntarily complied
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.390 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
[Music]

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
areas here of question on
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
one of them is that we heard from
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh ryan gottlobe
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
that and the uh employment security
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
analyses that on
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
more wage uh
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
total wages in this state
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
on during covid
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
then on
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
at least as we went along in covid
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
than there had been before even though
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
there were considerably less people
 
00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:11.270 align:start position:0%
there were considerably less people
employed

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
employed
 
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
because the low-wage people were thrown
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
out of the labor force they were mostly
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
on doing personal service and
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
couldn't do it they were shut down
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
and the high income people continued
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
to work and to get on
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
get raises and
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering on i don't think that
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
ends up meaning that there was more bet
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh that it would just be a small amount
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
of increase on the bt side and that most
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
157 or whatever it was million
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
on is profit rather than
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
then wages than things that we tax in
 
00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.190 align:start position:0%
then wages than things that we tax in
bet

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
bet
 
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
have you thought about those that
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
melissa do you have any thoughts on that
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
um i was trying to see if i had this
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
split between
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
vet and pbt um
 
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
for this month but i do think there's a
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
couple of things there at representative
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
ally i think you're right we have heard
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
that i was trying to go through um brian
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
gottlieb's presentation while you were
 
00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:29.910 align:start position:0%
gottlieb's presentation while you were
speaking

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
real quick because i do think
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i think there's a couple
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
of things that we've heard from
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
economists that
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
high wage earners have earned more
 
00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.990 align:start position:0%
high wage earners have earned more
income

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
than they have like you stated however
 
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
low income earners have had severely
 
00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.589 align:start position:0%
low income earners have had severely
reduced

00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
incomes um from employers than they had
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
how much those offset each other i'm not
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
entirely sure
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
if it is the higher earner incomes then
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
we would have more of a bet
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
of that increase depending on which
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
businesses you're talking about as well
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
so if they're smaller businesses we may
 
00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
not see it as much in bed
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
compared to larger businesses
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
that are in the state but we can
 
00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.069 align:start position:0%
that are in the state but we can
definitely

00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
drill into that a little bit more and as
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
carolyn said
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
the thing that we're struggling with
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
right now is that we have
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
a record number of extensions filed
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
compared historically
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
so what we have for data is so
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
minimal compared to what we have had in
 
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
the past
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
so we can take a sample of of
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
compensation on the bet return and see
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
if we've seen an
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
increase in that for the returns that
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
have been filed
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
however i'm not sure of how much of a
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
picture that will represent the whole
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
once we get all the returns in in
 
00:38:49.359 --> 00:38:50.710 align:start position:0%
once we get all the returns in in
october

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
october
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
i asked to wait my secondary until after
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things is you need
 
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
a heck of a lot of wages increase
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
in order to compete against what you
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
were getting in the business profits tax
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
because a million dollars every million
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
dollars extra
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
wages just generates
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
six thousand dollars of det so
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
if you had a hundred million dollars of
 
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.589 align:start position:0%
if you had a hundred million dollars of
wages

00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
wages
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
it's it's very hard
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
to really equate one against the other
 
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
but go ahead um you want to hold your
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
next question
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
so then represent ames
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um i think
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
that you uh dra were um
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
looking into the composition of the uh
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
the money that's come in in terms of
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayer types of taxpayers
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
and size i'm wondering if you have
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
melissa would you like to speak to what
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
you have thus far i can see you looking
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
for it
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
sorry i was i was pulling it up as we
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
spoke um
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
so yes uh representatives we did have
 
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
your email it took a little bit longer
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
to dig in
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
only because when returning reporting
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
extension payments we don't necessarily
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
break down combined filers versus
 
00:40:44.079 --> 00:40:45.270 align:start position:0%
break down combined filers versus
corporations

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
so you think you had asked us to look at
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
extension payments that had come in
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
based on the top two tiers of the
 
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:53.910 align:start position:0%
based on the top two tiers of the
triangle

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
triangle
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
so for those that are not completely
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
familiar with our triangles
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
the top two tiers equal um taxpayers
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
with a hundred thousand dollars
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
or greater of tax liability so we were
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
looking at of the extension payments how
 
00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:07.510 align:start position:0%
looking at of the extension payments how
many

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
how much of those came in for the top
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
two tiered um
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
amounts in the triangles as well as how
 
00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:15.589 align:start position:0%
amounts in the triangles as well as how
much

00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
of the extensions were made up for
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
combined filers or water
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
water zip edge filers so for
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
extension payments for march and april
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
we got about 197.4 million
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
in revenue in those two voucher form
 
00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.750 align:start position:0%
in revenue in those two voucher form
payments

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
um about 49 just under 50
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
of those were from combined filers and
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's based on their 2019 filing
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
so 97.2 million out of the 197.4 million
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
were combined fathers which are
 
00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:49.430 align:start position:0%
were combined fathers which are
typically

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
typically
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
our larger corporate uh our larger
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
corporations and our larger filers
 
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
and then comparing that extension data
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
to those top two tiers of the triangles
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
again 100 000 or more
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
in bpt i should specify um that was
 
00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:06.710 align:start position:0%
in bpt i should specify um that was
about

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
40 or 78.3 of the extension payments
 
00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:10.950 align:start position:0%
40 or 78.3 of the extension payments
coming

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
coming
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
in were paid by taxpayers
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
in that that either the bottom half or
 
00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:17.510 align:start position:0%
in that that either the bottom half or
the

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
the lower two tiers um of the
 
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
of the triangle can you send us those
 
00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.510 align:start position:0%
of the triangle can you send us those
statistics

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
sure i think we have an email that will
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
go out today
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate that is there
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
anything uh that you would say that
 
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh um you've learned from this
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
that that maybe uh
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i wish more
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
people filed on returns
 
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
than extensions just to throw that out
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
there um
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
we like data here so we like to dig in
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
and find it and it's really
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
because this is i know we say word again
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
unprecedented times
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
and modeling out revenues is definitely
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
challenging in this environment
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
and looking at an extension for those of
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
you who have not filed an extension it's
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
literally a piece of paper with a number
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
on it
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
with no information um
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
and they're so much higher than they
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
ever have been so
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think we have necessarily
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
gleaned anything off of them
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
that we would like to see typically in
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
march and april which is unfortunate
 
00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.670 align:start position:0%
march and april which is unfortunate
because

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
we also would like to know where this
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
money is coming from and
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
and how the breakdown is and have less
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
assumptions than
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
we're having to make but again it's hard
 
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
when you've never been through this
 
00:43:43.839 --> 00:43:45.270 align:start position:0%
when you've never been through this
before

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
and trying to figure out what the future
 
00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
brings uh
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
if i may just one other question
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
just with respect to say the
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
combined number 49
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
um is that substantially different or
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
roughly the same i don't have
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
your historical reports in front of me
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
and similarly for the top two tiers of
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
the triangle
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
are there changes uh relative to what
 
00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.750 align:start position:0%
are there changes uh relative to what
we've

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
always seen in the past it's a great
 
00:44:19.359 --> 00:44:19.829 align:start position:0%
always seen in the past it's a great
question

00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
i don't have the information on that
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
this is the first time that we've
 
00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.069 align:start position:0%
this is the first time that we've
actually

00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
dug into extensions and broke it out
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
between combined filers and corporate
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
corporations so we haven't done this in
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
prior years
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
however we can but when i do that i
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
would probably look at returns and
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
extensions because right now
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
extensions again are so far ahead
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
of returns you really can't compare it
 
00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
well you can't compare it to 20 because
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
of the due date change but you'd have to
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
compare it to 19
 
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
and the extensions didn't look like they
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
did versus count
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
so um i think we could drill into that a
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
little bit more right now i don't i
 
00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
don't have a comparison factor on that
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
well i i i'd encourage the drilling and
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
i understand the caveats and the caution
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
too yeah
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you as a follow-up to his question
 
00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
can you give us an appreciation of
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
the number of additional extensions
 
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
and the magnitude compared to 19.
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
just flip through my sheet here right
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
here and then provide that in your email
 
00:45:37.119 --> 00:45:42.390 align:start position:0%
here and then provide that in your email
too

00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
so extensions compared to 2019 dollar
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
um in count wise
 
00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
i believe they are up 20 almost 20
 
00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:01.430 align:start position:0%
i believe they are up 20 almost 20
percent

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay and then the follow-up question to
 
00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.069 align:start position:0%
okay and then the follow-up question to
that

00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:06.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
is that normal compared to
 
00:46:12.829 --> 00:46:12.839 align:start position:0%
going back five years prior to
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
19 a year a year
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
um i don't have data on that but my gut
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
instinct is is
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
yes um i know looking back just
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
generally based on our accounts document
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
we've never seen extensions this high
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
the count of um um
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
nor the dollar amount in them thank you
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative elmi do you have your
 
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
second question
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you yes on
 
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to look at all of these
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
individual stimulus payments that people
 
00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:47.910 align:start position:0%
individual stimulus payments that people
got

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
got
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
the lower income people would have just
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
debts that that they normally paid
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
on time on paying their rent
 
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
paying for for their electric bills and
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
and um gasoline and all that kind of
 
00:47:08.319 --> 00:47:11.829 align:start position:0%
and um gasoline and all that kind of
thing

00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
but beyond that some a lot of people
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
apparently were putting money
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
and then they were buying a lot of stuff
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
and apparently most of the stuff
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
i was from outside the state and
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
came through amazon
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
so it would have been all sorts of
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
companies um
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
and some of it was our local grocery
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
stores and stuff but they probably
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
weren't buying
 
00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
much more than they would have if there
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
hadn't been coven
 
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
so um i don't know
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
what else they would have been spending
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
money on but have you got any thoughts
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
about on whether any of this
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
activity would have actually
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
materially changed changed our revenue
 
00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:03.750 align:start position:0%
materially changed changed our revenue
sources

00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
sources
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
that well there's liquor
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
and that's not the only one i can think
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
of because the tobacco is basically from
 
00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:15.190 align:start position:0%
of because the tobacco is basically from
massachusetts

00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
um is there any of that that we actually
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
end up taxing indirectly
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
so i think that's really the the
 
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
conundrum that i was trying to talk
 
00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:28.309 align:start position:0%
conundrum that i was trying to talk
about

00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
earlier is you know
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
the the the covet pandemic
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
in isolation would have substantially
 
00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:41.910 align:start position:0%
in isolation would have substantially
reduced

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
revenues um and so
 
00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:48.079 align:start position:0%
therefore the stimulus
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
in some respects simply brought us
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
up to where we would have been had the
 
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic not
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
happen i think the question that
 
00:48:59.349 --> 00:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
representative major is
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
trying to identify is did it lift it up
 
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
lift us up higher than where we would
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how we in a data driven
 
00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.069 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how we in a data driven
way

00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
really give you that answer
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
um just because of the amount of detail
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
that we get
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't really say is this a dollar that
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
would have been spent
 
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
but the extensive buying of stuff that i
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
understand happened and most of it
 
00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.430 align:start position:0%
understand happened and most of it
remotely

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
remotely
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think we've got anything in our
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
tax system
 
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
that would pick that up at this point
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
i think i can tell you anecdotally
 
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
without disclosing taxpayer information
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
that you know big box stores
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
performed really well um retail
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
generally what we know anecdotally to be
 
00:49:59.040 --> 00:49:59.829 align:start position:0%
generally what we know anecdotally to be
retail

00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
retail
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
um type taxpayers
 
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
performed well last year
 
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
um to me that is evidence that some of
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
that spending
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
was um more than just
 
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
you all representing me
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
um as much as i can be okay uh
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative romney followed by
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
this wasn't going to be thank you mr
 
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
chair this wasn't going to be my comment
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
but i will comment
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
if you were trying to build a pool last
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
summer an
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
in-ground pool you had like a two-year
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
waiting list in new hampshire
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh people are spending money that they
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
normally would spend on going on
 
00:50:54.069 --> 00:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
vacation and stuff like that is we
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
we heard all sorts of stories about
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
those kind of things but
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
melissa um you may want to just share
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
some stories from the other states that
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
so that the committee can appreciate
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
that we don't stand alone in terms of
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
kind of uh kind of wandering in the dark
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
here a little bit
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh trying to estimate uh future revenues
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
you want to share some of those stories
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
from other states or
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
one whatever yeah sure um i want to
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
pause one second though because i
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
realized they pulled the
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
wrong documents so it happens when
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
you're going on the fly for extensions
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
if i can just update my numbers i
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
i give you mid month numbers not end of
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
the month dollars were up 63 percent
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
compared to 19
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
and counts were up 48 percent compared
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
i knew that never seen below when i
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
before we finished this session
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
i'd like to hear from the dra you don't
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
all the information that you have at
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
this point in time
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
your revenue estimates for fy 22 and 23
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
have you come up with new revenue
 
00:52:12.559 --> 00:52:14.390 align:start position:0%
have you come up with new revenue
estimates

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
and then if they're not specific it's a
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
a new range so i'll go to representative
 
00:52:21.599 --> 00:52:23.270 align:start position:0%
a new range so i'll go to representative
spillsbury

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
spillsbury
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
i had my uh mr chair
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
a chance to react to my question
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative of brahmin
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
um sorry i sidetracked there for a
 
00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:34.390 align:start position:0%
um sorry i sidetracked there for a
moment

00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
uh so yeah so compared to other states
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'm waiting for another report
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
we get um that sort of comes in to see
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
how other states are doing we just got
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
it from march but i don't think march is
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
the whole picture as we know april just
 
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
came in really strong
 
00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
and the march report that does compare
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
other states revenues
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
showed some states have some pretty good
 
00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
winners in the corporate tax department
 
00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839 align:start position:0%
and some have losers
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
anecdotally speaking about april which
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
was was sort of uh
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
a big change compared to march march um
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
we had some growth but not what we had
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
compared to april
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
i do know um there are states that are
 
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
doing really well um
 
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
for instance we've we've been chatting
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
with california a bit
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
um for our sb3 because they have a
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
similar bill out there
 
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
that we just like to get some impact uh
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
input back and forth to make sure we're
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
and we were just chatting somebody
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
someone in the same similar position
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
and they're typically they have a much
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
larger revenue source for their
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
corporate income tax compared to ours
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
they're normally a few maybe a few
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
hundred million ahead of plan and
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
currently right now they're a billion
 
00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:46.470 align:start position:0%
currently right now they're a billion
dollars

00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
plus ahead of their plan and they're
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
sort of in the same situation that
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
revenue is definitely
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
um flowing in so we are hearing that
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
from other states again
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
when we get the report for april it will
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
be more definitive numbers and answers
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
versus anecdotally
 
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
um but there are other states that are
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
faring well
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
there are other states that are not
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
doing as well i think new york isn't
 
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
doing as well
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
but it it we're not alone in this
 
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you since you mentioned
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
california didn't california come up
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
with an
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
estimate of what it would cost them if
 
00:54:23.119 --> 00:54:24.150 align:start position:0%
estimate of what it would cost them if
they

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
forgave the ppp loans
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
yeah that's huge
 
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
it's a big state it's a big state
 
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
and like we really need to compare what
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
the total revenue
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
business tax revenue would be compared
 
00:54:47.359 --> 00:54:51.670 align:start position:0%
business tax revenue would be compared
to

00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
and ourselves get an idea for a big
 
00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:54.789 align:start position:0%
and ourselves get an idea for a big
state

00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
that conforms with the feds on the
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
ppp whether on
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
how much increase they've seen in
 
00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:11.430 align:start position:0%
how much increase they've seen in
revenues

00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
are you asking a state that conformed
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
um sort of automatically so it should
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
have been baked in
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
we can take a look at that and see if we
 
00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:21.910 align:start position:0%
we can take a look at that and see if we
can

00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
any more information on other states
 
00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
if not then we can go to representative
 
00:55:35.119 --> 00:55:36.549 align:start position:0%
if not then we can go to representative
spillsbury

00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
spillsbury
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
followed by also us
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just before i
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
asked uh my question
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh another point on california is that
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday there were headlines
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
indicating their
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
state revenue surplus is great enough
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
that they're thinking of sending
 
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh payments out to their
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers similar to the ones that have
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
been sent out in three stages by the
 
00:56:01.839 --> 00:56:03.589 align:start position:0%
been sent out in three stages by the
feds

00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
feds
 
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
um i i guess i'm going to
 
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
try and formulate this is a question
 
00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:10.390 align:start position:0%
try and formulate this is a question
that

00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
lacking data we have to make a lot of
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
assumptions we look around for anecdotal
 
00:56:16.319 --> 00:56:17.910 align:start position:0%
assumptions we look around for anecdotal
stories

00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
stories
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that uh
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
what we see in net on on 2020 is a
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
great skewing of outcomes
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately a lot of times
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
governmental actions have the tendency
 
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
of pushing
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
separations even further than they were
 
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
before so the poor get poorer and the
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
rich get richer
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
and so you know following up on a couple
 
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
of comments that
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative olany made
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
it seems like there were an awful lot of
 
00:56:51.119 --> 00:56:52.630 align:start position:0%
it seems like there were an awful lot of
low-income

00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
low-income
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
high-touch service workers who were very
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
badly hurt
 
00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
and maybe many of the businesses that
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
employ that kind of worker
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
hospitality and tourism and restaurants
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
were the ones that were most harmed and
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
then there were many other sectors that
 
00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:17.190 align:start position:0%
then there were many other sectors that
did

00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
better than normal i was going to use
 
00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
the pool analogy also
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative rami but you name it when
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
it comes to backyard
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
entertainment um i've never seen
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
so much chatter on our community forum
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
about about where can i get
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh trampolines and uh uh
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
grills and all kinds of other stuff to
 
00:57:42.069 --> 00:57:42.079 align:start position:0%
be used at home
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
trying to get tradesmen to do anything
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
uh was difficult home depot was doing an
 
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
incredible business with home
 
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
improvement stuff
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
renovations and
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
so we've already had comments about big
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
box stores and internet purchases
 
00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
and businesses that switched production
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
to support ppp
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh an enormous a number of employees who
 
00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:08.470 align:start position:0%
uh an enormous a number of employees who
were

00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
offered bonuses to stay on
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
or hardship pay including teachers
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
i just wonder whether net net
 
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
when the stories and the date is all in
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
in two three years and we look
 
00:58:24.549 --> 00:58:24.559 align:start position:0%
back we might actually find that there
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
was on that
 
00:58:29.309 --> 00:58:29.319 align:start position:0%
increased economic activity in
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
2020 and we see it in our own tax
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
revenues on the one side we see
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
that the meals and rooms tax down
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
but we see the tobacco the liquor the
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax all up so this
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
skilling is occurring in so many ways we
 
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
can't keep track of it but it doesn't
 
00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:50.470 align:start position:0%
can't keep track of it but it doesn't
necessarily

00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
mean that total net income was down and
 
00:58:56.789 --> 00:58:56.799 align:start position:0%
total net economic activity was down
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
from a state perspective our revenues
 
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
ride on total net activity
 
00:59:09.589 --> 00:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
i think the answer has to be yes um
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
because the numbers
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
the numbers are the numbers
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
it's a nice review of representative
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
hillsboro spillsberry
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh representing software
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman an anecdote and
 
00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
then i want to follow up on
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative spillsberry um
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
i did decide to buy a new oven this
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
winter because i was doing more cooking
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
and my local appliance store generations
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
running it
 
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
um at a great small business said this
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
has been their best year ever
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
and they were way backed up with all
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
kinds of appliances and i think
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's just one more example and my
 
00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.150 align:start position:0%
that's just one more example and my
follow-up

01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh goes along with um representative
 
01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.670 align:start position:0%
uh goes along with um representative
spillsberry

01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
spillsberry
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
there were many people who got up to 3
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
000 in stimulus funds
 
01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
who did not have any financial need and
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
i really think that
 
01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
those extra checks coming in to really
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
middle-income people
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
throughout new hampshire i think then
 
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
they thought about what is something
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
i've always wanted to get
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
but again following up on the
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative i do think a lot of that
 
01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:25.990 align:start position:0%
representative i do think a lot of that
money

01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
may be summoned to savings but i think a
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
lot of it did flow into the new
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that's a fair statement i
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
think i'd give you another example i
 
01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:50.470 align:start position:0%
think i'd give you another example i
mean

01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
think about um student loan the
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
suspension of payments on
 
01:00:59.030 --> 01:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
federal student loans that's sort of a
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
below the radar item but think about the
 
01:01:02.079 --> 01:01:02.710 align:start position:0%
below the radar item but think about the
impact

01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
of potentially not having to make your
 
01:01:07.109 --> 01:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
student loan payments over the last
 
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
over a year now um and what
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
would what potentially folks did with
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
the that dollar
 
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
because the decision was agnostic to
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
the borrower um needed
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
to have their suspend their payment
 
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
suspended it was
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
just suspended even things as simple as
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
that and as
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
discrete as that could certainly have
 
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
had an
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
impact on consumer spending saving
 
01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:38.559 align:start position:0%
all of those things that directly feed
 
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
yeah and i think just um to add to that
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
economically what we've heard from
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
economists are that
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
although spending was great it was still
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
stalled some
 
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
and this is what it looked like and
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
there is a pretty good pent-up demand
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
for spending that they anticipate seeing
 
01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:03.039 align:start position:0%
in this next coming year
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
and i think couple that with
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative southworth who spoke
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
about the spending and then maybe some
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
in savings i think what we've also heard
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
is that savings
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
personal savings accounts are at an
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
all-time high as well
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
so it's almost a split of there was
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
increased spending
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
but maybe not even at the peak of what
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
it could have been
 
01:02:24.309 --> 01:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
coupled with people were putting funds
 
01:02:24.319 --> 01:02:26.150 align:start position:0%
coupled with people were putting funds
away

01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
so it's not a total loss at the end of
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
okay i've got a question to ask the dre
 
01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:37.039 align:start position:0%
is that with the release
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
and then they've just recently released
 
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
the rules even though we don't have them
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
in place yet or
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
all right we will be getting somebody to
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
come in and
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
help us understand what the rules are
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
going to be what do you anticipate
 
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
these american recovery act funds
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
are going to do to our revenues
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
we haven't done any um any
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
actual estimates i think it would
 
01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:25.829 align:start position:0%
actual estimates i think it would
because

01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
so much of the money is going to flow to
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
the state and it's going to be a state
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
level decision
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
on how to use it i think it will depend
 
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
a bit
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
on what new hampshire and all the other
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
states decide to do with that money
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
but i think it's safe to say that to the
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
extent the programs mirror what was
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
um distributed in the first rounds
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
of stimulus through the cares act i
 
01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
think you would
 
01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
we would anticipate seeing a similar
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
impact um as we saw in fiscal
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
21 from those funds because it sure is
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
affect our overall revenue picture but
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
nobody understands
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
how it's fun so
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
we need to get revenues out and agree on
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
by the time we do our committee of
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
conference and i don't think we'll have
 
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
the answers complete at that point in
 
01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.349 align:start position:0%
the answers complete at that point in
time

01:04:25.349 --> 01:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
have you adjusted your revenue estimates
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
for fy 2223 at this point in time or are
 
01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:32.309 align:start position:0%
for fy 2223 at this point in time or are
you

01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
more information on the american
 
01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
recovery act
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead melissa um we
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
have since we presented to you last
 
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
we dug into april and revised our fiscal
 
01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:55.839 align:start position:0%
year 21
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
numbers um as for our 22
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
and 23 um we have not made any
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
additional adjustments from when we
 
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
presented to you
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
um i believe it was a couple weeks ago
 
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
all right represent eleanor
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
thank you on is the dra
 
01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:20.839 align:start position:0%
also responsible for trying to
 
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
um arpa guidance the
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
american rescue plan guide guidance that
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
just got
 
01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
issued from the treasury and
 
01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.190 align:start position:0%
issued from the treasury and
specifically

01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
on how it affects uh
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not um
 
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
if we keep all those tax cuts in the
 
01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.430 align:start position:0%
if we keep all those tax cuts in the
budget

01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
or we pass a bill that we just voted to
 
01:05:46.559 --> 01:05:46.950 align:start position:0%
or we pass a bill that we just voted to
pass

01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
pass
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
yesterday that's much smaller uh
 
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
the sb 101 on
 
01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
how on whether they would
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
great question yeah so i i printed it
 
01:06:07.039 --> 01:06:07.750 align:start position:0%
great question yeah so i i printed it
yesterday

01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
and killed a lot of trees and read it
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
so i did attempt to understand it but i
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
don't think that the department will be
 
01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:15.750 align:start position:0%
don't think that the department will be
the

01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
agency that will officially weigh in on
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
that question i really think
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
that that will be the department of
 
01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.230 align:start position:0%
that that will be the department of
justice

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
justice
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
um or gopher probably gopher with you
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
know the advice
 
01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:31.839 align:start position:0%
of the department of justice since
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
gopher is the agency that will
 
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately be responsible
 
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
for spending the vast majority of those
 
01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
arpa funds
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
or at least that's my understanding i
 
01:06:43.829 --> 01:06:43.839 align:start position:0%
don't have any inside
 
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
knowledge on that if i
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
could we never got hardly any
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
information out of gopher and we never
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
and this is really important to our
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
committee i wonder
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
are we going i i distributed to
 
01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
everybody after representative ames told
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
us that
 
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh there was a larger document than the
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
one i'd found
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
on last night i distributed to everybody
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
the pages that deal
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
with uh net tax revenue reductions
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
which is only about 20 pages uh 15
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
i think so but it is extremely dense so
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
i haven't
 
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
started to read it yet because i was too
 
01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.710 align:start position:0%
started to read it yet because i was too
tired

01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
tired
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
last night and
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
on i think especially the timing issues
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
of when the money
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
comes in when its growth is calculated
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
from all that
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
i hope it's in there but we need to
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure there's going to be
 
01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:51.190 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure there's going to be
additional

01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
publications on interpreting
 
01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
how to spend these funds and
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
how you can get in trouble and not get
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
and that will come come with time
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
but we only have to let 20 till early
 
01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:17.110 align:start position:0%
but we only have to let 20 till early
june

01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:22.550 align:start position:0%
 
represents

01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:25.839 align:start position:0%
thank you um yeah i just want to second
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh the thought advanced by
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
representative army
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
um that it's important that
 
01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
identifying the information that's
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
responsive to the treasury's guidance
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
in a way that we all feel comfortable
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
with because it's going to be
 
01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical and it starts with
 
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.309 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical and it starts with
[Music]

01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
the sort of baseline year that
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
the guidance points towards which they
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
call fiscal year 2019
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative alameda yesterday uh
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
wondered what fiscal year means in that
 
01:09:09.679 --> 01:09:10.390 align:start position:0%
wondered what fiscal year means in that
context

01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
context
 
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
is is the same as ours or not i
 
01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:15.759 align:start position:0%
kind of think it's not the same i think
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
it's the federal fiscal year
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
which is which way do you go october to
 
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
september or september to october which
 
01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:24.870 align:start position:0%
september or september to october which
ever

01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
ever
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
if that's the case there's going to have
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
to be some jiggering with
 
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
our numbers to square them with that
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
baseline and then there's a lot of
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
figuring that goes in
 
01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
as time passes um
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
and i'd certainly like to see a process
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
that goes beyond
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
the process that the governor set up
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
with the gopher
 
01:09:58.229 --> 01:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
system and i hope that
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
let's say the legislative powers that be
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
are focused on this
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
while there's still time to to address
 
01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:11.430 align:start position:0%
while there's still time to to address
this

01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
next week tuesday
 
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
we'll be dealing with a web session on
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
22 and senate bill three
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
on wednesday i hope to have somebody to
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
come in that
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
understands what the rules are relative
 
01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:38.229 align:start position:0%
understands what the rules are relative
to

01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
the american recovery act what can
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
how it can be spent and and what not to
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
spend it on
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
to so it doesn't jeopardize
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's what we're planning for next week
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
any further questions for today
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
representative salzburg
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh the questions
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
for you
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
let's say we do pass a budget in june
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
and if that happens there are major
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
changes that
 
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
we discover in the summer fall whether
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
it's the rules uh
 
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
different funds and so on what is the
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
process from there on
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
is there something typical the way they
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
handle something that's pretty unique
 
01:11:29.189 --> 01:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
that's the same question i have and that
 
01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
would have to be worked out with the
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
senate president
 
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
and the speaker to see
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
what the strategy would be yeah and this
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
strategy could very well be is to come
 
01:11:45.199 --> 01:11:45.590 align:start position:0%
strategy could very well be is to come
in

01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
and have another session yes okay
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you a new budget
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
yeah this is a unique year so it just
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
seems like you know
 
01:11:58.870 --> 01:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh creativity is needed and
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative i'm followed by
 
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative brown here
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
i think representative brownlee was from
 
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative romney thank you uh mr
 
01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:14.550 align:start position:0%
representative romney thank you uh mr
chair

01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
so i just want to are we going to cover
 
01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:17.990 align:start position:0%
so i just want to are we going to cover
uh

01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
the preliminary thoughts of the dra
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
today as
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
it goes to how the if we do pass sb3
 
01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
the spread of the impact over the next a
 
01:12:34.630 --> 01:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
that we all will not hit in one fiscal
 
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
year the 99.4 million
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
right um as a matter of fact
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
we we have discussed that you and i have
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
with the dra so maybe the dra might want
 
01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:49.990 align:start position:0%
with the dra so maybe the dra might want
to

01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
explain how
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
the sp3 would fall out
 
01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
over the fiscal years how much of it
 
01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.750 align:start position:0%
over the fiscal years how much of it
would

01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
show up in fy 21
 
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
yeah after so when we chatted um we
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
on monday representative abrami what we
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
had done is
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
taken a look at really california's
 
01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.350 align:start position:0%
taken a look at really california's
methodology

01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
methodology
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
in their you know fiscal note equivalent
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
for their senate bill 3
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
bill um and
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
they had determined that you know the
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
bulk of the impact
 
01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
was in fiscal 22 maybe as much as 50
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
about a quarter of the impact in 23 and
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
then the rest in out years
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
um but california is different than new
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire and
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
a couple of important ways including the
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
they tax partnerships and llcs very
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
different than new hampshire does
 
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
at the individual level instead of at
 
01:13:58.229 --> 01:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
the entity level
 
01:13:59.669 --> 01:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
as well as some of the certain
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
parameters that they put on their
 
01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
own decision to conform um to the
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
federal ppp
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
treatment so i think what i would like
 
01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
is and what we've we began doing
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
yesterday was
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
sort of coming up with a new hampshire
 
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
specific methodology
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we wouldn't differ
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
significantly from what
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
california predicted and we can talk to
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
you about that next
 
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
week if that is helpful but i think it's
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
fair to say
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
that the bulk of the impact we would
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
expect to be in fiscal 22
 
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
followed by 23 and then trailing impacts
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
in later years
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful by next week we
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
should know
 
01:14:47.189 --> 01:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh what we will be doing on senate bill
 
01:14:47.199 --> 01:14:49.750 align:start position:0%
uh what we will be doing on senate bill
3.

01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
at this point we have not made a
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you i just wanted to ask is the
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
only thing we're going to exact next
 
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:02.470 align:start position:0%
only thing we're going to exact next
week

01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
uh on sb
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
22 was it uh yeah
 
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
or are we going to possibly exec
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
sb3 at this point
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
it'll be sp22 sb3 is
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
up in the air
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
because uh well both uh
 
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
representative murphy and i have been
 
01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.350 align:start position:0%
representative murphy and i have been
talking

01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
talking
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
with our very capable uh
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
chamber executive uh
 
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
for our region and on
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
i think that it really would be good to
 
01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:46.310 align:start position:0%
i think that it really would be good to
get

01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
some kind of of
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh input from the chambers
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
on the issues that a number of people in
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
the committee have brought up about
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
are barely surviving on this uh at this
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
point that god sp
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
got ppp loans and uh which ones
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
well we could look at that next week too
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
we could bring in a chamber member
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
and hopefully
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
bia can identify
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
some of the businesses that are just
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
barely surviving and some that didn't
 
01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:46.310 align:start position:0%
barely surviving and some that didn't
survive

01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
survive
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
the bia generally deals with big
 
01:16:48.719 --> 01:16:50.070 align:start position:0%
the bia generally deals with big
businesses

01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's the chambers that deal with the
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:02.390 align:start position:0%
 
out

01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
we have our work ahead of us i think we
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
will be in a better position to know
 
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
