comment
 
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
um who who wants to start from the
 
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 align:start position:0%
Department all right so so let let me
 
00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 align:start position:0%
let me tee this up so this has been a
 
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
difficult request that I've made of the
 
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
department because we're we're so close
 
00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 align:start position:0%
to having the governor's budget released
 
00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
um there was some question of why I
 
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
wanted us to meet and and so what I've
 
00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 align:start position:0%
I've done is I've U you're the assistant
 
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner or director associate
 
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner associate commissioner okay
 
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
congratulations again uh so I I had a
 
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
chance to talk to the associate
 
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner about it and I I reiterated
 
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
our promise that uh the committee won't
 
00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 align:start position:0%
be asking about dollars or numbers of
 
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
tees or any kind of Manpower but I I did
 
00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 align:start position:0%
ask her to focus on kind of an audit
 
00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 align:start position:0%
Trail almost it's not exactly that but
 
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
sort of a a history of of the programs
 
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
that are in public health now and how
 
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
they got there and so and then we're
 
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
also going to talk about some contracts
 
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.229 align:start position:0%
also going to talk about some contracts
with

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 align:start position:0%
UNH right um so so with that uh you're
 
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
you're you're welcome to begin thank you

name is Patricia Tilly I'm an associate
 
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 align:start position:0%

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services um thank you
 
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to come and talk to
 
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
you a little bit about public health um
 
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
I want to give you five things over the
 
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
next 60 Minutes or however long this
 
00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 align:start position:0%
takes that I hope that will inform your
 
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
decision-making as you wrestle through
 
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 align:start position:0%
the budget um I know that you have a lot
 
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
of work ahead of you and so these five
 
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 align:start position:0%
things are informed by history
 
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
by data and by the needs of your
 
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
neighbors your friends and the people
 
00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
that you represent so here's the five
 
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
things that we're going to talk about as
 
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
requested from representative Edwards
 
00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 align:start position:0%
I'm going to walk through the history
 
00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 align:start position:0%
and the authority of Public Health that
 
00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:47.439 align:start position:0%
led us up to our current organizational
 
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 align:start position:0%
structure pre pandemic and post pandemic
 
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to highlight where the general
 
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 align:start position:0%
court has historically invested some
 
00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
general funds in public health no
 
00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 align:start position:0%
numbers but I'm going to just sort of
 
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
tell you where they are are um I'm going
 
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
to describe how the division has
 
00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 align:start position:0%
reorganized over that pandemic into its
 
00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 align:start position:0%
current configuration and then four um I
 
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
am going to transition if time allows
 
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
into addressing some of the questions
 
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
that we had the last time I was here
 
00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 align:start position:0%
when I talked about Behavioral Health
 
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
and dcyf to talk about the role of
 
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
prevention public health and that
 
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
Continuum of dhh H DHHS services and
 
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
then five of course is to answer any of
 
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
the questions that you have as we go
 
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
forward so that's that's my goal as we
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
go through here so if we jump in um that
 
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
second slide we you'll notice that this
 
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
is the third time you've seen slide two
 
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
and you're going to probably see it
 
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
maybe even one more time today and my
 
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
conversation today is really going to
 
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 align:start position:0%
focus on the base of this figure that
 
00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
supports the building of the foundation
 
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
of Optimal Health and well-being for
 
00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
everyone um as we transition into just
 
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
the little bit of the history side of
 
00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
today um you're going to have to indulge
 
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
me in a few minutes as we talk a little
 
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
bit about where we got here and I'm
 
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
going to start you back in
 
00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
1882 um actually 1881 um it's hard to
 
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
believe there was a time when there was
 
00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
not a Department of Health and Human
 
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
Services in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
it was actually legislated put into
 
00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
being in 1881 the first Department was
 
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
in place in
 
00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 align:start position:0%
1882 and I just want to have you think
 
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
about a moment that moment in time and I
 
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
actually have the props sitting behind
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
me I actually have the initial very
 
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
first report from the Department of
 
00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
Health from 1882 used to sit in my
 
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
office when I was the director of Public
 
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
Health so back at that time and I think
 
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to find some parallels
 
00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities and individuals were
 
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
navigating industrialization in the
 
00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 align:start position:0%
state with new opportunities for work
 
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
new opportunities for wealth but some of
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
that came at a cost at that time
 
00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 align:start position:0%
smallpox was running rampant in the
 
00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
Mills and it was po in up all over the
 
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
state and infants and children and
 
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
pregnant women were dying from
 
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
complications of birth as well as
 
00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 align:start position:0%
infectious diseases our Industries
 
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
agriculture um and human waste was
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
actually contaminating the rivers in the
 
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
state and our water supplies and our
 
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
food and milk was rampant with
 
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
adulteration with contaminants in our
 
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
food and milk and so that's where the
 
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
state legislature said there we need to
 
00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:30.199 align:start position:0%
do something about that so on SL five
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
you'll see the opening paragraph from
 
00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 align:start position:0%
the first report of the Department of
 
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
Health um and this which is now stat um
 
00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 align:start position:0%
RSA 1259 so you'll see that opening
 
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
statement it is now translated into this
 
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
foundational um piece of authorization
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
which is that the now the commissioner
 
00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Health and Human
 
00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
Services shall take cognizant of the
 
00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
interest of the health and life among
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
the people and make invest
 
00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919 align:start position:0%
investigations in qu queries and so that
 
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:03.560 align:start position:0%
is what we do today you know you can
 
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
speed through and look through at your
 
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
time on your own Leisure around SL could
 
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
you give me a moment CU I I think I'm on
 
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
the wrong okay oh sorry no no that's me
 
00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:16.919 align:start position:0%
sure so by the time you get to slide six
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
this also takes you a little bit through
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
the history where 1901 we set up a
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
public health laboratory which we still
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
have today we developed there was
 
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
legislation in 1909 that in that allowed
 
00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:31.639 align:start position:0%
us to have inspector of sorts food and
 
00:07:34.869 --> 00:07:34.879 align:start position:0%
otherwise 1921 we started talking about
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
maternal and child health and in 1986 we
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
specifically carved out communicable
 
00:07:42.909 --> 00:07:42.919 align:start position:0%
disease all of that provides a
 
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
background of where we are today to get
 
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
to representative Edward's question on
 
00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:50.919 align:start position:0%
slide seven which is what did Public
 
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
Health look like before the pandemic so
 
00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
on slide seven you'll see our state
 
00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:00.759 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2018 division of Public
 
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
Health Services org
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
chart you'll see um six bureaus I will
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
give you that we had 250 full-time
 
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
authorized positions in for the state
 
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
2018 budget we then move into slides um
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
eight and nine and that describes the
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
programs how they existed for the 2018
 
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919 align:start position:0%
2019 budget um as a reminder you know
 
00:08:30.149 --> 00:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
most of
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
question correct the on the on the slide
 
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
here do these do these names map into
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
the activity descriptions yes in the
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
budget they they're are they map one to
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
one or are they close um they they are
 
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
90% mapping there and as you move into
 
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
slides and again this is from 2018 so as
 
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
you move move into slides eight and N
 
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
they should oh match thank you okay so
 
00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:57.959 align:start position:0%
as you move into slides eight and N this
 
00:09:00.269 --> 00:09:00.279 align:start position:0%
is just at a very high level level what
 
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
those bureaus mean what the main
 
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
programs in each of those bureaus I've
 
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
also highlighted where historically
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
there have been general fund Investments
 
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
there are general fund Investments for
 
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:14.200 align:start position:0%
maternal and child health mainly as a
 
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
match to something called our Title Five
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
Grant which is the federal funding
 
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
another fund history fact it's the
 
00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
oldest Grant um two states was maternal
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
and child health um federal grants so
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
MCH has been around since the
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
1930s um and morphed into a block grant
 
00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
as we know it today under the Reagan
 
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:39.160 align:start position:0%
Administration so longtime work when it
 
00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
morphed into a block grant at that time
 
00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
it was required to have a state general
 
00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
fund match we have a limited amount of
 
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:50.200 align:start position:0%
General funds around child vaccine in um
 
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
in our Bureau of infectious disease I'm
 
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I just want to make sure I
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
understand I'm listening right general
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
fund match does that mean is this is a
 
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
50/50 program or you you don't mean to
 
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
be that precise I don't mean to be that
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
precise for this particular Grant it's
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
um you have to maintain it's more of a
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort so it's a you
 
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
maintain the amount that was there when
 
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
the grant initially went in so there's a
 
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
requirement to have a maintenance of
 
00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
effort all right to be more precise
 
00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:22.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question all right um
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of money in for
 
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
infectious disease for childhood vaccine
 
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
money in our Public Health laboratory
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
that's where where the greatest bullus
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
of General funds are is to maintain that
 
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
laboratory that started in 1901 and is
 
00:10:38.829 --> 00:10:38.839 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily important to this day
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
and then as we move into slide eight in
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
food protection and then back in 2018
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
General funds and our state loan
 
00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:50.839 align:start position:0%
repayment program so again highlight
 
00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
that this is where strategic Investments
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
have been made over time and what the
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
you you're doing great I and I keep
 
00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:04.959 align:start position:0%
tripping you up but the state loan
 
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
repayment there's deeper slides on this
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
you'll be more specific about who the
 
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
intended beneficiaries of those
 
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
repayment programs are I I I don't have
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
specific slides on the state loan
 
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
repayment I'm happy to take questions
 
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:19.240 align:start position:0%
and answer them okay so let's just just
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
hang a a comment off of there it it
 
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:25.240 align:start position:0%
would be good to see sort of an
 
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
itemization of what kind of Eligibility
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
there is for state loan repayment sure I
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
can tell you that off the top of my head
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
and then we can follow up with
 
00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:35.079 align:start position:0%
additional information if you would like
 
00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
so the state loan repayment was designed
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
to be a state program um that provides
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
loan educational loan repayment for
 
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
health care providers when it was
 
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
designed originally many years ago it
 
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
was really focused on
 
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
Physicians and um and to get them to
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
rural areas to qualify for the program
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
you must agree to work in an um an
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
underserved area often times that's our
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Centers rural
 
00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
areas or where there's a population
 
00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
where there's unmet medical need a
 
00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
medical Ser a a um hit uh I can't
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
remember the name off the top my head
 
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
but underserved areas um the state you
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
then sign a contract with the state and
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
we give you three years worth of loan
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
repayment assuming that you stay working
 
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
for those underserved um populations
 
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
either either in a federally qualified
 
00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:33.639 align:start position:0%
Health Center or a hospital we expanded
 
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
this program several years ago before
 
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
the pandemic to include Behavioral
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
Health Providers and so quite frankly
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
the majority of our state loan repayment
 
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
right now are for Behavioral Health
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
Providers down to the Master's level
 
00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
anyone who is certified to Bill
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
essentially um can have um Can may have
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
access to the state loan repayment
 
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
program again that they serve
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
underserved areas so folks like our
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers are big
 
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
users of the state loan repayment for
 
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:07.240 align:start position:0%
their staff is there anything else you'd
 
00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
like just off the top of my
 
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
head represent
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
walner just I wondered if quickly you
 
00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
could tell us maybe how many uh
 
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
providers have received the have been
 
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
involved in this loan repayment program
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
people thanks for the question I can't
 
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
tell you the number off the top of my
 
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
head we this this program prog has
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
expanded and contracted over times um we
 
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
used some arpa money during the pandemic
 
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
so we were able to open up the doors
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
even wider and not only um attract
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
additional folks but actually continue
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
beyond the three years for some we were
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
able to extend with some of those arpa
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
funds as well we can get back to you
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
with the exact number but I can tell you
 
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
that the proportion right now is really
 
00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
in the behavioral health world we still
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
have some dentists who we we brought on
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
dental providers and dental hygienists
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
to match up with the Medicaid um adult
 
00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:04.839 align:start position:0%
benefit so that we could make sure that
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
if they were serving a Medicaid
 
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
population they would be eligible for
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
State loan repayment thank you th this
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
is this is good I I'm learning more
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
every time I hear this and so the
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
definition of an underserved area where
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
the medical need needs to be
 
00:14:26.189 --> 00:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
provided it would be interesting to um
 
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
later to hear
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
how that analysis is done great there's
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
a there is a pretty standard analysis
 
00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:37.399 align:start position:0%
that we use across the country it's
 
00:14:39.389 --> 00:14:39.399 align:start position:0%
what's used to designate our federally
 
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
qualified Health Centers and Rural
 
00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
Health Centers so it's it's a little bit
 
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
complicated I can't rattle it off the
 
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
top of my head but there is um an
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
analysis that we use from the federal
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
government to determine medically
 
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.150 align:start position:0%
government to determine medically
underserved

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
underserved
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
areas representative nvan call yes Mr
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
chairman uh you said that predominantly
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
the shift is a followup to
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative walner question that the
 
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
the split on who is uh this the growth
 
00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
in this has been predominantly in the
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
behavioral uh Health Providers yes
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
roughly ballpark this so the split as
 
00:15:20.749 --> 00:15:20.759 align:start position:0%
you see it 8020 5050 it's actually
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
probably close to 8020 right
 
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:25.720 align:start position:0%
now and and mainly because we've
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
expanded to the types of providers so
 
00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
that we have Masters
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
clinicians as opposed to when slurp was
 
00:15:34.749 --> 00:15:34.759 align:start position:0%
sort of first imagined which was really
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
thinking about Physicians um the good
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
news about getting down to that Master's
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
level group is that we can serve more
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
people uh the proport the dollar amount
 
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
that we give for loan repayment is built
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
into our system so we give more money to
 
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
Physicians and dentists who have higher
 
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
medical or dental school bills then
 
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
someone who is at a master's level who
 
00:15:59.230 --> 00:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
has um who has some loan repayment but
 
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
it's at a lesser level and so we
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
proportionately give a a smaller amount
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
to Folks at that Master's level versus
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
the MD or DMD level so one one quick
 
00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:12.519 align:start position:0%
followup so you know not to get into
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
specific numbers but so the split on the
 
00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:18.279 align:start position:0%
total number of providers roughly 8020
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
if you looked at the financial split
 
00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
would that um and given the explanation
 
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
just gave would that significantly alter
 
00:16:30.749 --> 00:16:30.759 align:start position:0%
that so we um so what I will say is just
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
to reiterate we're able to serve more
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
people with at the lower level of of
 
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
clinicians I don't mean that but it's
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
sort of that mid level of clinician we
 
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
can serve more people because we can
 
00:16:43.389 --> 00:16:43.399 align:start position:0%
make the money spread a little bit
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
farther okay thank you
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
y represent
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
Daniels thank you uh looking at the 2018
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
structure are any of those programs
 
00:16:59.949 --> 00:16:59.959 align:start position:0%
mandated by the federal government
 
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
so that that's a great question I think
 
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
um many um you know roughly especially
 
00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
in 2018 about 85% of the funds for the
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health were federal
 
00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
funds or sometimes other funds but you
 
00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
know that's roughly been the split 85
 
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
federal or other and then 15% General
 
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
funds um so by mandated we have grants
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
for each of those so we do that work I
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
would have to get back to you of exactly
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
what if there were any federal
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
requirement for any one of those
 
00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
programs but I can tell you that they're
 
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
mostly Fally
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
funded okay and and just beond on the
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
the other research are there any
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
mandates that have been placed upon us
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
that are not funded thank you I don't
 
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
believe there are at this time
 
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
thank representative
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question can you
 
00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
speculate why there has has been a raise
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
in the number of behavior
 
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
health needs in this state is this
 
00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
because of the post pandemic and you
 
00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
know thank thank you representative P
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
Pierce that um PRI um that's the
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
million-dollar question isn't it right
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
now and if we have time today I you know
 
00:18:23.789 --> 00:18:23.799 align:start position:0%
I have a little bit I have a few slides
 
00:18:26.149 --> 00:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
here really talking about the base of
 
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
some of those Behavioral Health needs
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
especially as you think about the
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
experiences that children go through
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
something called adverse childhood
 
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
experiences there's that component
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
there's also lots of components around
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
issues of the concrete supports families
 
00:18:42.029 --> 00:18:42.039 align:start position:0%
need the stressors that have been on
 
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
them that was certainly exacerbated by
 
00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
the pandemic so I can get to that
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
later to uh nail down representative
 
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
Daniel's question a little bit more uh I
 
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
I hear you that we receive federal funds
 
00:18:58.149 --> 00:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
correct and when we accept the federal
 
00:19:01.149 --> 00:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
funds we're uh accepting the mandates
 
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
that go with them so so I think the
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
distinction that I we we need to have is
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
is those programs that were required by
 
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
federal statute to have and those that
 
00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
we basically opt into because we opted
 
00:19:20.669 --> 00:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
to take the Grant I i' I'd like to be
 
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
able to understand that DeMark Nathan's
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
going to talk a little bit more about
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
that sure so um good afternoon members
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
of the committee Nathan white Chief
 
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer of Department of
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services one really
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
important thing that I just want to
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
remind this committee about before we
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
get too deep in the weeds today is that
 
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
we right now we are preparing all of the
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
house presentations and many of you will
 
00:19:45.149 --> 00:19:45.159 align:start position:0%
probably remember I think representative
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
Mooney referred to it as the coloring
 
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
books that we bring um we'll be bringing
 
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
those back again and within those we go
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
through every Bureau and every account
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
in the programs and we also have these
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
documents called budget briefing books
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
uh and for each one of those uh accounts
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
that are over a million dollars we
 
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
include what are the outputs what are
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
the deliverables what are the federal
 
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
requirements what are the different
 
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
funding sources is there a match is
 
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
their maintenance of effort and so we'll
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
be providing those books this is part of
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
the challenge between having these
 
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
discussions before the governor's budget
 
00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:20.919 align:start position:0%
comes out so I just kind of want to
 
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
highlight that and and have that in the
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
back of all the members mind that we
 
00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
will have that documentation for you
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
here um and and that's prepped and ready
 
00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:30.039 align:start position:0%
but we just need the governor's budget
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
to come out so we can start to get into
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
those numbers and some of these specific
 
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you so if you
 
00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
slide to um slide 10 please this is the
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
org chart that director Ian watt is
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
going to be presenting exactly during
 
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
those budget hearings right now this is
 
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
the this is the constellation of
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
programs within the divisional Public
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
Health Services as of today and you'll
 
00:20:56.909 --> 00:20:56.919 align:start position:0%
see a couple things we have reorganized
 
00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
some bureaus we moved from bureaus to
 
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
seven and that is because we've had uh
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
the Emergency Services Unit which was
 
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
which is now called The Bureau of
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
emergency preparedness response and
 
00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:11.919 align:start position:0%
resilience um but it's important to note
 
00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:14.039 align:start position:0%
that within this new structure this new
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
or chart we still roughly have the same
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
number of full-time authorized positions
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
again we're going to talk more about
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
that when you have your budget
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
presentation but while this looks like a
 
00:21:28.029 --> 00:21:28.039 align:start position:0%
big shift in reality we are moving some
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
pieces around to make more
 
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
organizational sense especially over the
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
course of the pandemic so if you look um
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
to slide 11 here's the things that have
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
t stayed the same our Bureau of
 
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
laborator our laboratory our Bureau of
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
infectious disease public health
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
statistics and informatics and the
 
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Public Health protection they
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
are largely the same as they were in
 
00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
2018 so good news all of that we have
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
been doing that work for a long time
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
time it is roughly stayed the same even
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
through the pandemic as we exploded in
 
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
temporary staff those numbers have also
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
come back down to pre-pandemic levels so
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
you saw this but our full-time
 
00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
authorized has stayed flat during that
 
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
entire time so let's get into a little
 
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
bit more detail of what moved where so
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
if on slide 12 you want to take a look
 
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
at the first thing that you'll Note pre
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
pandemic 2018 we had some something
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
called The Bureau of population and
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
Community Health and in that Bureau was
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
our maternal and child health programs
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
our Wick programs all of our chronic
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
disease programs and our tobacco
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
programs at that time in 2018 that
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
Bureau had more contracts in it than any
 
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
other division in the Department of
 
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services it was a a
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
large number of federal grants and a
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
large number of community engagement and
 
00:22:58.159 --> 00:22:59.350 align:start position:0%
large number of community engagement and
community

00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
um Partnerships so for that reason it
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
made sense to split it in half the span
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
of control was too wide in that program
 
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
and we needed to have the expertise that
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
could really manage and the leadership
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
to manage those so we split it in half
 
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
into a bureau of family health and
 
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
nutrition and a bureau of prevention and
 
00:23:22.029 --> 00:23:22.039 align:start position:0%
wellness family health and nutrition is
 
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
essentially what was maternal and child
 
00:23:27.549 --> 00:23:27.559 align:start position:0%
health and Wick prevention and wellness
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
is all of our vast array of chronic
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
disease prevention programs and tobacco
 
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
that's how those two things were split
 
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
you'll see in a minute that we've added
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
a couple of other things into the Bureau
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
of prevention and wellness so that's a
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
big exchange so no net new really we
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
were just sort of going from one to
 
00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:48.200 align:start position:0%
other splitting it in a half the next
 
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
thing as I mentioned earlier we had our
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services Unit which was
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
located in our commissioner's office
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic mainly so that it
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
could provide Provide support for any
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
emergency response across the department
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
the pandemic happened and the Emergency
 
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
Services Unit essentially um was
 
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
deployed in many ways to the division of
 
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services to help with that
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
response the Emergency Services Unit was
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for putting on those big
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
vaccine events the events that were at
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
the racetrack our blizzard booster Blitz
 
00:24:26.669 --> 00:24:26.679 align:start position:0%
all of that was done by our emergency
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
what was then the Emergency Services
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
Unit and because of the alignment
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
between public health and their work it
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
made sense to just move it all within
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
the organizational structure of Public
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
Health to keep those lines of
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
communication good and also the lines of
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility um also so that part and
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
parcel just moved over to
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
dphs to this day it makes a ton of sense
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
um they help us on all sorts of
 
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
responses from you may recall we had a
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
measles outbreak in the Upper Valley
 
00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
this summer we've had Legionella even
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
even this past week you may have seen in
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
the news that we've had a case of
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
something called empo they help us dayto
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
day and are very tightly connected with
 
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
um our infectious disease program I'm
 
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
sorry I it says emergency but do they
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
also take standard missions like uh when
 
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
the start of school shows up do they
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
help coordinate uh vaccine programs for
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
no it's really about emergency events
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
they also have a responsibility to work
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
with Homeland Security so there are
 
00:25:30.269 --> 00:25:30.279 align:start position:0%
those of you who are familiar with the
 
00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
way Homeland Security works there are
 
00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
these things called essential functions
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
esfs um and so they manage housing and
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
health and wellness so they have a foot
 
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
over a connect sort of a dotted line
 
00:25:45.149 --> 00:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
over to hscm so a different way that
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
isn't necessar seems directly related to
 
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
Public Health when we had the eclipse
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
last spring they were deployed to make
 
00:25:57.149 --> 00:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
sure that we had first aid um available
 
00:25:59.310 --> 00:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
in all the areas in the in the North
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
Country when we had that Rush of you
 
00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:03.559 align:start position:0%
know tens of thousands of people so
 
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
those are the sorts of things they work
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
you uh I have a I have a quick question
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
so uh this is staffed for emergencies
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
but is it a Flexible Staffing uh
 
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
situation or I mean if you don't have an
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
if you don't have a that's getting a
 
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
little close to where we're not talking
 
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
money or man I'm not talking money I'm
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
just talking I can answer that I can
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
answer it quickly it is a fixed step
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
and then we have volunteers that Flex as
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
we need them okay thank you so because
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
we're always mindful um if you go to
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
slide 13 of not expanding our footprint
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
too much um so you'll know that we split
 
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
that one big Bureau population Health
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
Community Services split that in half we
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
added ESU and so we reduced something we
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
eliminated what was then a bureau of
 
00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
Public Health policy systems and
 
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
performance we eliminated that Bureau
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
and realigned those programs into
 
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
existing bureaus so we took the office
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
of rural health and primary care and the
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
state loan repayment program put that in
 
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of prevention and wellness we
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
took therapeut our therapeutic cannabis
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
program some quality improvement work
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
our legislative liaison and put them
 
00:27:24.029 --> 00:27:24.039 align:start position:0%
directly under our deputy director at
 
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
the division of Public Health so we just
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
moved the deck chairs a little bit to
 
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
balance span of control um to make sure
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
that there was an e uh an equitable lift
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
Chiefs so then you will move into slide
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
um uh 14 so those are that's th those
 
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
were the bureaus that's how that
 
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
structure went from six to seven bureaus
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
mainly because we added that Emergency
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
Services Unit we split one Bureau and
 
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
then eliminated another so that's how
 
00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
you got from six in in 2018 to seven
 
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
currently there's also important to note
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
as you do think about the funding again
 
00:28:05.549 --> 00:28:05.559 align:start position:0%
when we go through our budget pres
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
presentation in a few weeks we moved
 
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
some programs as well one of those was
 
00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
the prescription drug monitoring program
 
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
that was in the office of professional
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
lure and
 
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
certification um I C uh around 2018 I
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
could go back and find the date the
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
legislature moved that Authority into
 
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
public health so they are now nestled in
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
that Bureau of prevention and wellness
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
as well so pdmp came over there are no
 
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
General funds associated with that but
 
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
just for your knowledge that's just
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
moved in there and then two areas where
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
we do have General funds are two
 
00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:43.799 align:start position:0%
programs called comprehensive child
 
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
family supports and services cfss you'll
 
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes see that as and support for
 
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
our Family Resource Centers these were
 
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
funded in the division for economic
 
00:28:57.549 --> 00:28:57.559 align:start position:0%
security at some point even prior to
 
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
2018 that were funded out of DCF they
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
now live in the division of Public
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
Health Services so th that money moved
 
00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
with them and traveled with with the
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
programs General funds into the division
 
00:29:13.389 --> 00:29:13.399 align:start position:0%
of Public Health it was budgeted in
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
other areas of the department before
 
00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.509 --> 00:29:22.519 align:start position:0%
there great so that's that's all I have
 
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
for just the organization you'll see um
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
again when we talk about the budget
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see how there are some increases
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
in general funds but mainly that's
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
because of some of these moving parts
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
that just moved from one part of the
 
00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:39.799 align:start position:0%
department into this part of the
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
department representative Edwards had
 
00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
had some questions around UNH contract
 
00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
so I can talk about them right now okay
 
00:29:48.669 --> 00:29:48.679 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm I'm just looking to make
 
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
sure I can map later the accounting uh
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
activity descriptions with your slide
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
deck sure and and so with without
 
00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:01.559 align:start position:0%
looking too closely like I see
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
Administration down there on 5131
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
8579 those two towards the bottom are
 
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
are they written up in your slide deck
 
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
here oh are you look I'm sorry what you
 
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
okay so I got an Insider's copy of um of
 
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
an abstract of the accounting units
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
for it did it get emailed to all of you
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
no at this point I've only shared sh it
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
with you and representative Mooney
 
00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559 align:start position:0%
because we were the only ones who talked
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
about it this morning but I have copies
 
00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:33.799 align:start position:0%
that I can hand out to the committee if
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
you like yeah could you
 
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um so so I'm I'm just I'm
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
just going to want to be able to go down
 
00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:45.559 align:start position:0%
the lists and know which one is which on
 
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
the activity descriptions sure so so it
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
it it depends if if we're referring to
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
an activity or an accounting unit
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
generally speaking though most of those
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
should map and when we do when we do our
 
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
presentations we will have the bureau
 
00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:04.039 align:start position:0%
and accounting detail and we'll be
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
covering all of all of the various
 
00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
functions of each area so there will be
 
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
a tie back to that during those
 
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
presentations that'll be very clear
 
00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you thank you um so let's
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
talk about UNH you had some questions
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards around division
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
of public Health's partnership with you
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
I I I did I understand we have four
 
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
contracts they've been around for a
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
while they're they're they are plan to
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
continue I don't want to talk about
 
00:31:32.909 --> 00:31:32.919 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts sure so if you look at
 
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
slide 15 I have two of those four
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
contracts um the two that are not there
 
00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:39.559 align:start position:0%
I'll start with that um one is a
 
00:31:41.549 --> 00:31:41.559 align:start position:0%
contract that has not moved forward so
 
00:31:43.389 --> 00:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
we we just took it off the list because
 
00:31:45.549 --> 00:31:45.559 align:start position:0%
it's not current right now the second of
 
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
the two that you don't see we had a
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
contract with the University of New
 
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for a fellowship essentially a
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
um a graduate level intern over the
 
00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
summer so I did not include that just
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
because of the transient nature of that
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
was just for that internship for a UNH
 
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
Fellowship for the summer they worked on
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
our food Protection Program they were
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
great but it was very time Limited in
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
less than
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
$10,000 the two main contracts that we
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
have though and we are continuing are
 
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
our maternal and child health
 
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist so for almost 20 years
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
now we have been working with UNH to
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
have a PhD level um uh Professor who is
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
expert in data analysis and maternal and
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
child health partner with the division
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
of Public Health to do the complex and
 
00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
sophisticated data analyses that are
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
required in order to look at the health
 
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
of moms babies and kids um this has been
 
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
a really extraordinary partnership over
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
the time we it allows us to get again
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
PhD highlevel sophisticated analysis
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
access and um in order so that we can do
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
this sort of program planning and
 
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
evaluation that we need to do to make
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
sure that we're making good choices
 
00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
about where we put programs what we
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
invest in and not only does this help
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
the division of Public Health Services
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
it's also been really helpful for
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to have somebody who
 
00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
understands not only the data part of it
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
but also the programming and the content
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
around maternal and child health to get
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
those two someone with those two pieces
 
00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
of knowledge together typically they are
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
in an academic environment so that's
 
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
been a great contract we we look forward
 
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
to continuing it so so on that I'm I'm
 
00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
looking down at the bottom uh of the of
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
that column and it says to help the
 
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
department make datadriven decisions to
 
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
improve health outcomes for mothers and
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
babies yes so I understand the theory
 
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
but would you be able to give specific
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
examples at the right time to to show us
 
00:33:47.629 --> 00:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
the the the connection between all this
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
great work being done in the academic
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
area and how it's translated to changing
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
patients lives sure we happy to do that
 
00:33:58.269 --> 00:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
in depth at at some other time I can
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
give you one example right now
 
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
postpartum coverage um the general court
 
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
was very generous in the past sessions
 
00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:08.919 align:start position:0%
to extend postpartum care to on for
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
women on Medicaid to 12 months the data
 
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
analysis of that was done in part by
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
this maternal and child health
 
00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist okay because in my life
 
00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
I've seen really great reports that
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
don't do anything because nobody takes
 
00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
the information and does something with
 
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
it and so I don't want to be building
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
beautiful documentation that doesn't
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
really matter to people I appreciate
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
that we use it to determine where we um
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
put our services um so uh for prenatal
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
care or to highlight there was once a
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
time where we did teen pregnancy
 
00:34:46.349 --> 00:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
prevention programs and we use the data
 
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
from this epidemiologist to pick the
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
areas in the state where would that
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
would be most effective not only where
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
the teen birth rates were high but where
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
there were other contributing factors
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
we've done that for other programs as
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
well when we need to we only have a
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
limited set of dollars and we want to
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
focus them on where they're going to
 
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
impact we use our MCH super thank you
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
sure and so the other piece um that we
 
00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
the other contract that we have in
 
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
public health right now is for the
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
Pediatric Mental Health Care Access
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
program these are federal dollars from
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
CDC that help um us connect providers to
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
Providers and we're going to talk about
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
it a little bit at the end of my
 
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
presentation as well but at a very short
 
00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.790 align:start position:0%
presentation as well but at a very short
level

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh or a very high level um the
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire does
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
something called project Echo and that's
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
where they do training for providers on
 
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
a number of different topics and so we
 
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
have contracted with them to do training
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
with pediatricians Primary Care
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
Providers to get to help them understand
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
what they need to know from child
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
psychiatry because as I talked about
 
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
last time we were here the pediatrician
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
really is the front line when we're
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
talking about Behavioral Health and so
 
00:35:58.829 --> 00:35:58.839 align:start position:0%
it connects p pediatricians with
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists and they do some cross-
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
Level Training and also does some really
 
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
interesting um teleconsult visits so yes
 
00:36:08.589 --> 00:36:08.599 align:start position:0%
I I didn't want to interrupt you I just
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
thought you were about done um okay so
 
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
so I can see the Practical value of this
 
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
but as I see it um it it feels to me
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
like this should be more of a temporary
 
00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
transitional program because it's
 
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
essentially doing what uh
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
professionals do anyways they they have
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
continuing medical education programs
 
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
they have societies that tell them what
 
00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
they need to know and what's the Hot
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
Topic they they they provide some
 
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
resources the telec consultation is a
 
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
new media relatively for them to be able
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
to cross talk with each other and so I
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
see uh this in its stable state to be
 
00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
kind of the natural Order of Things
 
00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
without a requirement for an explicit uh
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
State driven
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
program that's that's my thought so do
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
you want to comment on that sure so it's
 
00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
a federally funded um program from CDC I
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
don't know how long you know and by that
 
00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
nature it's temporary you know we have a
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
five-year Grant and we do the work and
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
then CDC decides what they want to fund
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
moving forward and we decide if it still
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
makes sense for us so it is time Limited
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
in that way and so we have been using
 
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
the past couple years to stand up the
 
00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
program build the cohorts of providers
 
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
someone's got to coordinate all that but
 
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
is this going to be in place 10 15 years
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
from now you know I would suggest
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
probably not we will probably be doing
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
something else by that time is is there
 
00:37:43.309 --> 00:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
a share with General funds in this you
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
may men federal funds this all 100%
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
Federal yep okay thank you great are
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
there questions representative
 
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:55.720 align:start position:0%
Daniels thank you in raising children I
 
00:37:57.069 --> 00:37:57.079 align:start position:0%
understand that there are always times
 
00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
where Behavior yeah comes into play so
 
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
how does one determine when a
 
00:38:05.069 --> 00:38:05.079 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist is needed that's a great
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
question thank you and I'm not a
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
provider so you know you're going to get
 
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
the non-clinical answer for that but in
 
00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
this particular program we know that um
 
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
moms and babies tend to show up at those
 
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
well child visits through childhood and
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
parents will describe behaviors that are
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
concerning there are validated screening
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
tools and so part of what this program
 
00:38:26.309 --> 00:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
does is make sure that those Primary
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
Care Providers those you know
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
pediatricians their regular pediatrician
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
have the tools they need to help
 
00:38:34.349 --> 00:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
determine what's regular behavior and
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
what might be something that's more
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
concerning and so you know they use
 
00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
their clinical expertise as well as
 
00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
these standardized evidence-based
 
00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
screenings to help make those decisions
 
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
and then um provide the referrals when
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
needed much like you know I would I
 
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
would frame that much like when you know
 
00:38:54.309 --> 00:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
those of us who are older go to the
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
doctor and say we might you know my
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
blood pressure might be raising and they
 
00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
will make that decision through their
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
series of clinical assessment and
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
screening tools of when you need to go
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
to a Cardiologist versus being just
 
00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:06.839 align:start position:0%
treated at your primary care provider
 
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
it's same thing okay I guess my my my
 
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
concern all it it almost sounds like
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
you're trying to fit every child into
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
the same box and and we obviously know
 
00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
that children are different from one
 
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
another 100% And that's really the
 
00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
that's the art of the clinical work is
 
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
to understand what's within the normal
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
range of development and all kids
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
develop differently along the way and
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
what could eventually be something that
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
um requires more intensive care so I I
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
agree with you 100% kids are all come
 
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
they're all unique but um the clinicians
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
are trained in their medical practice to
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
understand what's within the bounds of
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
normal or expected or typical and then
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
what might need additional
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
care represent toski thank you I just
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
have a quick question and this is just
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh something I'm curious about as I'm
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
thinking about it my children are all in
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
their young 20s and so over the course
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
of a decade as they went through their
 
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
Primary Care visits um there was an
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
introduction partway through um with my
 
00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
middle child and younger child of like a
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
screening tool on depression anxiety
 
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
which my older child didn't get is that
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
something that would have come through
 
00:40:20.589 --> 00:40:20.599 align:start position:0%
your department to implement that or is
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
that more of like training from National
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
Best Practices uh both 100% so certainly
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
best practices would inform that um AAP
 
00:40:32.109 --> 00:40:32.119 align:start position:0%
the American Academy of Pediatrics
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
certainly takes a position on what
 
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
really is the the best practice they
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
have something called anticipatory
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
guidance for pediatricians where all the
 
00:40:42.589 --> 00:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
smart pediatricians get together and say
 
00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
this is what you should be talking of
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
every one of those well visits and these
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
are the sort of tools you should use the
 
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:49.720 align:start position:0%
way division of Public Health supports
 
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
that is to provide additional training
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
where needed at times and also to set
 
00:40:58.270 --> 00:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
expectations sometimes for um for
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
community health centers that may
 
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
receive specific funding from the
 
00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
division to say oh yeah there's that
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
developmental screen we would have an
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
expectation that you do developmental
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
screening at these particular Milestones
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much great okay so um the
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
rest of your presentation looks like a
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
good subject matter material for us to
 
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:23.839 align:start position:0%
be smarter in public health um would
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
would you be able to um summarize and
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
hit the high points and make your main
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
points in like 10 minutes or less I will
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
do my best thank you that's a lot of
 
00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
slides but we I I can do that for you
 
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll give you a heads up on 23 yes
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
uh you have these arrows connecting to
 
00:41:43.309 --> 00:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
one another Y and what I'd like to know
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh when you get there is uh are those
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
are those arrows they it makes it appear
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
as though they're all full and intacted
 
00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
and everything's working like a machine
 
00:41:56.109 --> 00:41:56.119 align:start position:0%
sure it I'd like the little Nuance
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
beyond Behind that we can get to that
 
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
what needs to be built what is broken
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know all right thank you thank you I
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that so I'm going to
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
fly through and I'm always happy to take
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
questions on this later on I appreciate
 
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
the need to get out of here early today
 
00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:13.240 align:start position:0%
so where we're starting on slide 17 and
 
00:42:14.589 --> 00:42:14.599 align:start position:0%
again you can take a look at this at
 
00:42:16.109 --> 00:42:16.119 align:start position:0%
your own time there's something there's
 
00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
an idea of something called adverse
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
childhood experiences and these are
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
experiences um such as abuse and neglect
 
00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
some household challenges that have been
 
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
found to correlate with some negative
 
00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
health effects as people become adults
 
00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:36.839 align:start position:0%
so if a child experiences physical abuse
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
emotional neglect has household
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
challenges of a family member
 
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
incarcerated you know um a parent who is
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
the treated violently through domestic
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
violence there was a a study a landmark
 
00:42:52.109 --> 00:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
study of over 18,000 adults in the
 
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
Kaiser Permanente um Health Group uh
 
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
that when studied those with some of
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
these negative Health outcomes mental
 
00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
health concerns risk-taking Behavior
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
substance use even higher risk for HIV
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
infectious disease and chronic disease
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
even heart attacks can be traced back in
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
some way to um the more of these adverse
 
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
childhood experiences you have the more
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
likely that you might have some of these
 
00:43:23.069 --> 00:43:23.079 align:start position:0%
negative health effects I present this
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
here simply because it's the the reason
 
00:43:28.109 --> 00:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
and the rationale for a public health
 
00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:29.720 align:start position:0%
approach that these are not just
 
00:43:32.829 --> 00:43:32.839 align:start position:0%
individual one-offs that in general
 
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
there appears to be some robust um
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
correlation between these experiences
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
that happen to children and adult health
 
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
and adult Behavior this also has a
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
generational effect as you have parents
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
who may have experienced these things as
 
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
children who were then parenting their
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
own children so in New Hampshire these
 
00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
adverse childhood you know experiences
 
00:43:58.990 --> 00:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
are incredibly common you know over 64%
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
of females in high school almost 50% of
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
high school boys report at least one of
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
those adverse childhood experiences as
 
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
you look at that list that makes sense
 
00:44:09.069 --> 00:44:09.079 align:start position:0%
there are things on there like divorce
 
00:44:11.549 --> 00:44:11.559 align:start position:0%
absolutely they may have experienced one
 
00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
of those as adults we also know that
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
about six out of 10 adults have also
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
experienced one or more of those adverse
 
00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
childhood experiences but the where the
 
00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:23.720 align:start position:0%
rubber hits the road is when you
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
experience a lot of them that's when the
 
00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.589 align:start position:0%
experience a lot of them that's when the
city

00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
city
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
effect happens more adverse childhood
 
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
experiences higher risk of negative
 
00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:35.960 align:start position:0%
Health outcomes so if you have an Aces
 
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
score they're called aces of five to
 
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
eight so if you look at that list if you
 
00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
check off five to eight of those things
 
00:44:45.309 --> 00:44:45.319 align:start position:0%
it indicates a significantly higher risk
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
for developing a range of physical and
 
00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
mental health conditions later in life
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
including depression substance use
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
chronic disease heart disease Cancer and
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
a shortened lifespan so when we look at
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
where our teens are today we see about
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
one and five have between three and four
 
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
aces and then a much smaller number to
 
00:45:08.549 --> 00:45:08.559 align:start position:0%
um represented Daniel's Point who might
 
00:45:11.309 --> 00:45:11.319 align:start position:0%
have had a lot of those experiences and
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
oftentimes those are kids that have
 
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
likely come through our division for
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
children youth and families or her are
 
00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
needing to access highly specialized um
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
behavioral health programs so I'll skip
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
over public Health's role in that but
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's really because the reason reason
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
Public Health gets its nose in this
 
00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
business is because we want to prevent
 
00:45:34.589 --> 00:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
those those long adult um outcomes we
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
also don't want any kids to be suffering
 
00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:39.160 align:start position:0%
as well but we have a role in preventing
 
00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
chronic disease behavioral health
 
00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
problems substance use so what can you
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
do about that I think that that's a
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
question that I know that others have
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
asked and there's a thing also you have
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
adverse childhood experiences those are
 
00:45:52.829 --> 00:45:52.839 align:start position:0%
all the negative things that could have
 
00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
happened to you but you pair that with
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
something that I think is even more
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
strong and that is our protective
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
factors and so all of us can think in
 
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
our minds of a person or a family who
 
00:46:06.549 --> 00:46:06.559 align:start position:0%
had a lot of horrible things happen to
 
00:46:08.829 --> 00:46:08.839 align:start position:0%
them as a kiddo and yet they've sort of
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
come through that with Incredible
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
strength and resiliency and oftentimes
 
00:46:16.549 --> 00:46:16.559 align:start position:0%
what you can match that back to is some
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
accumulation of these five protective
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
factors around having social emotional
 
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
competence you can recognize and deal
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
with your emotions you have knowledge of
 
00:46:29.069 --> 00:46:29.079 align:start position:0%
parenting and Child Development again if
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
you're a parent if you learn about
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
parenting even if your experience as a
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
child was less than optimal but if you
 
00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
learn and grow into understanding the
 
00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:41.559 align:start position:0%
best ways to parent to in order to
 
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
support your child that's a protective
 
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
Factor social connections we talked
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
about this last time you can't you know
 
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
I if you're isolated whether you're a
 
00:46:52.549 --> 00:46:52.559 align:start position:0%
young parent or an older adult we know
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
that puts you at higher risk for all
 
00:46:56.109 --> 00:46:56.119 align:start position:0%
sorts of negative Health outcomes and
 
00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
then of course the end of the day there
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
are those concrete supports do you have
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
housing do you have health insurance do
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
you have food on the table all of that
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
if you've got those things it helps to
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
make you and a family more resilient and
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
so this is where public health comes in
 
00:47:14.549 --> 00:47:14.559 align:start position:0%
with some of those programs you know you
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
can flip to page 22 or slide 22 and you
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
see that triangle that I shared the last
 
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
time again we spend a lot of money right
 
00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:25.720 align:start position:0%
now on those individuals that have this
 
00:47:28.349 --> 00:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
really high need for services and we
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
spend that money in residential care
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
there is a suggestion and I think data
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
to to support this that if you rightsize
 
00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:38.599 align:start position:0%
that triangle and spend more time again
 
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
if you think about a parent who had
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
those negative adverse childhood
 
00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
experiences in their childhood who were
 
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
now taking care of a new baby if you
 
00:47:50.349 --> 00:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
spend the little time talking about um
 
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
building connections building parenting
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
skills you have an opportunity to
 
00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
interrupt that gener erational
 
00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
pattern so so I'm getting to your slide
 
00:48:03.549 --> 00:48:03.559 align:start position:0%
may may I I think uh representative PRI
 
00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
had a question but I I I I want to for
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
transparency to the public I I just want
 
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
to say that uh it's my and you can
 
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
correct me um what I want to say is that
 
00:48:20.589 --> 00:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
uh we are looking at a current situation
 
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
where we invest heavily in sort of the
 
00:48:27.309 --> 00:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
high-end uh more expensive uh
 
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
um interaction with providing care and
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
the theory is that if we had invested
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
differently and we had put more money
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
into prevention that we would have saved
 
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
money on the back end and so uh so to
 
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
the extent that there's a proposal to
 
00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
shift resources the challenge that we're
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
going to have in this budget year is you
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
still need the money to take care of the
 
00:48:57.789 --> 00:48:57.799 align:start position:0%
people in desperate need
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
and then you would need to find new
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
money to be investing in the preventive
 
00:49:05.789 --> 00:49:05.799 align:start position:0%
side and I think in this particularly
 
00:49:09.309 --> 00:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
budget challenged year or two years
 
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
that's going to be very difficult for us
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
to be able to really do that and and
 
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
this this these ideas represented here I
 
00:49:20.829 --> 00:49:20.839 align:start position:0%
think are very good very solid but I I
 
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
just keep uh hitting the Dilemma of of
 
00:49:26.789 --> 00:49:26.799 align:start position:0%
how we're going to do both things with
 
00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
the same dollar and and so
 
00:49:32.829 --> 00:49:32.839 align:start position:0%
I representative priest that was more
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
commentary than anything because I I Am
 
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
I Wrong do you I think the challenge in
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
front of you is to look at the pie that
 
00:49:42.789 --> 00:49:42.799 align:start position:0%
you have right now and determine how
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to spend that understanding
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
there aren't going to be more resources
 
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
and so where do you strategically invest
 
00:49:51.549 --> 00:49:51.559 align:start position:0%
it is the challenge that comes every two
 
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
years as you build a budget and I
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate that this year is going to be
 
00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
particularly difficult but my um what I
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
would suggest is as we think about it if
 
00:50:04.109 --> 00:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
you pull from one string to balance
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
something up here is there may be
 
00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences later on it is a
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
challenge always in a banian budget
 
00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
because you may realize those costs may
 
00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
come later and they're not going to come
 
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
in this this bium so that's why you all
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
are smart and at the table and you put
 
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:22.799 align:start position:0%
together your budgets understanding that
 
00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
so so I I do hear you I think we are
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
smart but but this is an this is an
 
00:50:30.789 --> 00:50:30.799 align:start position:0%
environment where experience really
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
matters and having walked the trenches
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
with your boots on the ground you have
 
00:50:38.109 --> 00:50:38.119 align:start position:0%
information that we and knowledge and
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
insight that we'll never have and so so
 
00:50:44.589 --> 00:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to rely on you to to
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
tell us where the strings are yes okay
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative PRI thank you Mr
 
00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
question it goes back to slide 17 when
 
00:50:58.510 --> 00:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
you break down down the adverse
 
00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
childhood experiences and the one in
 
00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
particular household challenges um
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't there have been um a circle
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
emphasis in the environmental lead
 
00:51:15.549 --> 00:51:15.559 align:start position:0%
poisoning as being very significant
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
because if a child has lead poisoning
 
00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.150 align:start position:0%
because if a child has lead poisoning
his

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
his
 
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
whole mental
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
growth yeah I fully appreciate and we
 
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
have and this um general court has been
 
00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
very supportive around lead poisoning
 
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
initiatives over time and I I can't
 
00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
overstate how important that is in a
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
state like New Hampshire where we have
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
such a significant number of homes built
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
before 1970 and quite frankly many of
 
00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
those that are in substandard conditions
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
so that paint is available so it was not
 
00:51:49.069 --> 00:51:49.079 align:start position:0%
part of this study I I could spend some
 
00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
time thinking about that because this
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
was based out of California that does
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
not have quite the same lead exposure
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
risk that we do here in the Northeast
 
00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
just because the age of our
 
00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
so represent tki I this is sort of
 
00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
somewhat connected to that I was
 
00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
expecting to see um a circle that said
 
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
poverty and how the interconnectedness
 
00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:15.559 align:start position:0%
of poverty for families and I just don't
 
00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
know how that comes into discussing Aces
 
00:52:22.829 --> 00:52:22.839 align:start position:0%
or not typically it hasn't um I mean I
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
think it comes in when we talk about
 
00:52:26.349 --> 00:52:26.359 align:start position:0%
protective factors really that's where
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
we we see the impact of poverty and
 
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
whether some of those impacts can be um
 
00:52:34.349 --> 00:52:34.359 align:start position:0%
mitigated by food housing you know
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
access to tanif access to snap access to
 
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
Wick that's where we can see that if
 
00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
those needs are met we have a better
 
00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:43.720 align:start position:0%
chance of making sure that um families
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
are more stable and the children
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
ultimately are more independent of those
 
00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
Social Services great thank you that
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
helps representative PRI uh going along
 
00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
with the previous question oh excuse me
 
00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question um going along with
 
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker's question um I
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
also agree that poverty needs to be
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
emphasized given the fact that there has
 
00:53:11.309 --> 00:53:11.319 align:start position:0%
been a rise of homelessness in our major
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
cities and all of our communities and it
 
00:53:18.309 --> 00:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
has definitely affected the um the
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
childhood Absolut absolutely and again a
 
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
protective Factor when you've got those
 
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:25.799 align:start position:0%
basic you know those of you studied
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
maso's hierarchy of needs you've got to
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
have that basic set need of your housing
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
and your food and you've got to have
 
00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
that stable so that you can do the
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
emotional regulation and the hard work
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
that is parenting as any of you who are
 
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
sitting here who are parents know it's a
 
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
hard enough job regardless but if you
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
don't know where your next meal is
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
coming from it becomes that much harder
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
so if we
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
y represent Daniels thank you uh what is
 
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
your success rate of your protective fa
 
00:53:59.710 --> 00:53:59.720 align:start position:0%
factors overcoming uh Aces versus people
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
remaining dependent on the government
 
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
sure so um you know we know that um
 
00:54:08.109 --> 00:54:08.119 align:start position:0%
programs and we can talk about that
 
00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
actually right now on slide 23 programs
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
like home visiting there are some
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
outcomes around there that if once
 
00:54:17.309 --> 00:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
people have these home visiting programs
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
where a trained person usually someone
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
from the community comes in and talks
 
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
about parenting connects people with
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
Services we know that there are fewer
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
you know um I'm going to look at here
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
their better birth outcomes so that's P
 
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
first of all great because that's less
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
money to Medicaid if you have a better
 
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
birth outcome you have um kids are going
 
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
to their health screenings um parents
 
00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:43.640 align:start position:0%
are better able to cope with stress
 
00:54:45.549 --> 00:54:45.559 align:start position:0%
better that they're more likely to
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
enroll in school the parents are more
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
likely to enroll in school training and
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
so that gets to those protective factors
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
that ultimately sets that whole family
 
00:54:55.549 --> 00:54:55.559 align:start position:0%
up for Independence at the end of the
 
00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
day especially is you want to make sure
 
00:54:59.950 --> 00:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
that both kids are attending school and
 
00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:01.640 align:start position:0%
that the parents are getting the either
 
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
the school or the training they need so
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
that they can be independent thank you
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
so as we look at slide 23 we've got five
 
00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
programs here and and I I um they are
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
part of a system which is like that
 
00:55:16.829 --> 00:55:16.839 align:start position:0%
little ch ch train of of arrows because
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
this is the the Family Support programs
 
00:55:21.069 --> 00:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
that are within the division of Public
 
00:55:23.789 --> 00:55:23.799 align:start position:0%
Health Services um a reminder back to
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
that 2018 time some of these were in
 
00:55:27.789 --> 00:55:27.799 align:start position:0%
other areas of the department they're
 
00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
now all nestled together organized under
 
00:55:32.589 --> 00:55:32.599 align:start position:0%
part Public Health in partnership with
 
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
the division of children youth and
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
families and our division for um
 
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health and we have five one
 
00:55:40.349 --> 00:55:40.359 align:start position:0%
is our family connection center this is
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
funded by General funds and this
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
supports families um where a parent is
 
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
incarcerated um and so there are Family
 
00:55:50.549 --> 00:55:50.559 align:start position:0%
Resource Centers built into the state um
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
men's and women's presence and this
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
enables connections between that um
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
individual who is incarcerated that
 
00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
resident of the correctional system and
 
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:02.039 align:start position:0%
their children because we know many
 
00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
times those family those moms and dads
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
are going to leave Corrections they're
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
not most of the time they're not there
 
00:56:09.309 --> 00:56:09.319 align:start position:0%
for the rest of their lives and they're
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
going to be a part of that child's life
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
going forward and so you want to
 
00:56:16.029 --> 00:56:16.039 align:start position:0%
optimize the ability for them to be an
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate parent and part of that is
 
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:19.720 align:start position:0%
building that connection so if you think
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
back to that Aces list a parent
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
incarcerated really can put kids on a
 
00:56:26.589 --> 00:56:26.599 align:start position:0%
trajectory can be one of those adverse
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
childhood experiences that have really
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
strong impacts on that intergeneration
 
00:56:34.109 --> 00:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
of mental Behavioral Health substance
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
use and risk-taking behavior so if you
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
can come in right then um while mom or
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
dad is incarcerated and build that
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
connection and teach some healthy
 
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
parenting while they're um incarcerated
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
that can be really helpful when they go
 
00:56:51.069 --> 00:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
back even if they don't ever go back or
 
00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
even if they no longer even have full
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
custody of their child Simply Having a
 
00:56:57.789 --> 00:56:57.799 align:start position:0%
relationship ship is helpful and that
 
00:56:59.670 --> 00:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
looks like reading bedtime like
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
recording bedtime stories um it looks
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
like having FaceTime visits and so these
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
funds help that happen we have our home
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
visiting program which is really one of
 
00:57:12.069 --> 00:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
our Flagship programs for um Pro
 
00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
providing support for children and
 
00:57:16.109 --> 00:57:16.119 align:start position:0%
famili young families we have a healthy
 
00:57:18.029 --> 00:57:18.039 align:start position:0%
families America program it's all over
 
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
the state it's very evidence informed
 
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
both nationally and locally and we can
 
00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
track the evaluation um it serves a
 
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
smaller relatively smaller number of
 
00:57:30.069 --> 00:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
families because it's pretty intensive
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
you enroll while you're pregnant and
 
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
it's Vol completely voluntary but you
 
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:35.720 align:start position:0%
enroll while you're pregnant and you
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
have um a home visitor who does parent
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
education with you until your child is
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
three so it's not a oneandone that's an
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
ongoing relationship um very effective
 
00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
the um the general court added hb2 money
 
00:57:52.029 --> 00:57:52.039 align:start position:0%
to add our to our ability to serve more
 
00:57:55.069 --> 00:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
families um in the last bium we have
 
00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
child and family health ports which is
 
00:57:58.990 --> 00:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
like home visiting and often uses the
 
00:58:00.829 --> 00:58:00.839 align:start position:0%
modality of Home visiting someone goes
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
out to somebody's home but this is
 
00:58:04.589 --> 00:58:04.599 align:start position:0%
really more episodic in nature and
 
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
really is designed to meet needs when
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
they need them um and is highly
 
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:11.039 align:start position:0%
connected to our division for children
 
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
youth and families um and our Family
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
Resource Centers and this uses a mix of
 
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
federal funds and a little bit of
 
00:58:19.069 --> 00:58:19.079 align:start position:0%
General funds we have something called
 
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
kinship Navigator as we all know we've
 
00:58:23.309 --> 00:58:23.319 align:start position:0%
got more and I talked about last week we
 
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:25.640 align:start position:0%
have more and more families grandparents
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
ants and uncles others taking care of
 
00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
kids that are in the dcyf system this
 
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
kinship Navigator is a person who can
 
00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
help that me that family member navigate
 
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
what it's like to have a kid when they
 
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know again grandparents it's been a
 
00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
long time since any of us had a little
 
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
kid in the house helps them navigate
 
00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:47.240 align:start position:0%
systems that is supported by federal and
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
general funds and then finally we have
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
our Family Resource Centers located all
 
00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
over the the state that coordinate some
 
00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
of these efforts and are a place for
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
families to have that kind of parenting
 
00:58:59.470 --> 00:58:59.480 align:start position:0%
education and build the connections that
 
00:59:01.549 --> 00:59:01.559 align:start position:0%
they need so that they can be stronger
 
00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
parents and that is generally supported
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
by General funds so I've I've gone over
 
00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
my 10 minutes um there are slides that
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
talk about these programs a little bit
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
more in detail if you want to learn more
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
about them um but at the end of the day
 
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
what I really wanted to leave you with
 
00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
is this notion um of you know across the
 
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
department we are working very hard in
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
my role as an associate commissioner
 
00:59:31.029 --> 00:59:31.039 align:start position:0%
between dcyf public health behavioral
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
health is to coordinate all these
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
efforts so that we can align prevention
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
we can centralize places to call for
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
help whether that's your pediatrician's
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
office or something much higher needed
 
00:59:44.029 --> 00:59:44.039 align:start position:0%
also for even the pediatricians
 
00:59:46.029 --> 00:59:46.039 align:start position:0%
themselves um we want to make sure that
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
we have our helpful services at the
 
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate scale so while we serve 300
 
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
families in that intensive home visiting
 
00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
program is that enough when you think
 
00:59:56.029 --> 00:59:56.039 align:start position:0%
about the number of families that could
 
00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
could be served we want to strengthen
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
supports that families stay that kids
 
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
and families stay home I want to reduce
 
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
the Reliance on residential care it's
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
one of our key um initiatives is to
 
01:00:11.029 --> 01:00:11.039 align:start position:0%
reduce that Reliance it's too expensive
 
01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:13.799 align:start position:0%
and it's not always great for kids um
 
01:00:16.109 --> 01:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
it's better for kids to be in families
 
01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:17.960 align:start position:0%
where it's cheaper and they have the
 
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
sort of social emotional support that
 
01:00:22.349 --> 01:00:22.359 align:start position:0%
they need and again our job is also to
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
coordinate expert care and finally
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
measure progress to see if any of this
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
works so you need the data to in order
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
to measure progress I have gone over my
 
01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:33.039 align:start position:0%
time a lot of time no you said an hour
 
01:00:34.829 --> 01:00:34.839 align:start position:0%
it's been less than an hour so you did
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
good so uh representative is this uh the
 
01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner wants to step
 
01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
away from the table you have a question
 
01:00:44.829 --> 01:00:44.839 align:start position:0%
yeah I have a I have a quick question
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
and that is on that chart what are the
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
trend lines look like in each one of
 
01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
these in in each one of these arrows so
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
so there's several questions like that
 
01:00:57.390 --> 01:00:57.400 align:start position:0%
that maybe we can address by looking at
 
01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
what you're putting in the coloring book
 
01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and could you refer to the
 
01:01:03.069 --> 01:01:03.079 align:start position:0%
exact slide that you're you're pointing
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at slide 23 it gives
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
specific numbers for how many and so I'm
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
interested in what the trend lines have
 
01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:13.559 align:start position:0%
looked like in each one of those boxes
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
up down flat super thank you and I'm I'm
 
01:01:18.589 --> 01:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
sorry because I'm I'm not familiar with
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
a coloring book since this is my first
 
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
term so I it doesn't exist it's it's
 
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
it's my nickname for a beautiful
 
01:01:27.029 --> 01:01:27.039 align:start position:0%
presentation they put together with
 
01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
tremendous information in it it it's
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
it's a derogatory term out of huge
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
difference to the work and quality of it
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering whether I should
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
bring my cray own crayons so it never
 
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
hurts I can't afford to give you any and
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
right now I don't know if we can afford
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
to give you color copies anymore so you
 
01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:49.480 align:start position:0%
enjoy it while you have them yeah so uh
 
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
represent of Mooney just with regards to
 
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
those coloring books the complete set of
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
hard copies is in my office anyone is
 
01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
welcome to come in and see them and also
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
they are online the LBA tab on the
 
01:02:08.029 --> 01:02:08.039 align:start position:0%
legislative website under last year's or
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
last term's budget the full complete set
 
01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:13.039 align:start position:0%
is scanned in so a few ways to access
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
those and they're very carefully well
 
01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:17.240 align:start position:0%
done thank you thank
 
01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:20.559 align:start position:0%
you um representative string I just just
 
01:02:23.269 --> 01:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
a clarification those are last terms
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
coloring books correct not the ones
 
01:02:28.109 --> 01:02:28.119 align:start position:0%
we'll get this week that is
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
correct Mr
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
chairman represent Daniels yes first of
 
01:02:34.269 --> 01:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
all thank you so much for the
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
presentation a lot of good information
 
01:02:38.029 --> 01:02:38.039 align:start position:0%
here one thing I would have liked to
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
seen a little bit more of since you you
 
01:02:42.549 --> 01:02:42.559 align:start position:0%
want to focus more on the preventive
 
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
side when we take a look at slide 17 in
 
01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
the uh the different things of abuse
 
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
neglect household challenges I'd be
 
01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:53.079 align:start position:0%
interested to know how you're planning
 
01:02:56.269 --> 01:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
on addressing those because I think
 
01:02:57.630 --> 01:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
that's what you're trying to accomplish
 
01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
is to stop those so it never gets into
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
the system but I didn't see a whole lot
 
01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
on the preventive so I I think um and
 
01:03:06.589 --> 01:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
part of that is a little rush for time
 
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
but those home visiting programs in
 
01:03:10.109 --> 01:03:10.119 align:start position:0%
particular are designed to reduce entry
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
in the child welfare system so that's
 
01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
one example that child and family health
 
01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
supports again is designed to reduce
 
01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
entry into that child welfare system and
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of data I think let
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
me look at the slide if I added it
 
01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
um uh so if you look at slide 26 you can
 
01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
see in the child um and family U
 
01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
comprehensive family support systems
 
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
that of the 1700 kids discharged from
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
that program in 21 um 76% had not had an
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
accepted investigation in three years
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
that's where the that's where the proof
 
01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
you know that's where the rubber hits
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
the road is those programs now we can
 
01:03:52.349 --> 01:03:52.359 align:start position:0%
never say fully it was that program but
 
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
that gives us encouragement that those
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
sorts of things help keep kids out of
 
01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
the system in the first place I I guess
 
01:03:59.950 --> 01:03:59.960 align:start position:0%
what I'm looking for and maybe there's
 
01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
something online that I can look at to
 
01:04:04.829 --> 01:04:04.839 align:start position:0%
to say that a home visit is going to do
 
01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
something I have no idea what happens in
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
that home visit I would love to take you
 
01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
on one someday if you'd like but we can
 
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
we can provide more information again
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
just given the time I didn't want to
 
01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
dive too deeply but we would love to
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
spend more time talking about those
 
01:04:20.069 --> 01:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
because it's really again a good
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
investment early on um to keep kids out
 
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
of the front door we talk about you know
 
01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039 align:start position:0%
the front door door of dcyf this is keep
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
keeping kids out in the yard far away
 
01:04:31.269 --> 01:04:31.279 align:start position:0%
from entering into the system and that's
 
01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
what we want more of good thank
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
you all right I think you're done with
 
01:04:40.269 --> 01:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
our questions for now so thank you so
 
01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
much appreciate it thank you and thank
 
01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to talk about
 
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
this I'm always happy to talk more

offline all right um so who wants to go
next

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:04.119 align:start position:0%
oops I'm here I'm not graceful so that
 
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
is one thing you will learn about me um
 
01:05:09.269 --> 01:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Chris santanello I am

01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
01:05:16.349 --> 01:05:16.359 align:start position:0%
Services I was originally supposed to
 
01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:18.839 align:start position:0%
present with associate commissioner
 
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
Tilly about a week and a half ago but um
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
I ended up being ill so I appreciate the
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity um to follow um Trisha
 
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
today want me to I'm just gonna just get
 
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
into it okay so I um want if you look on
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
slide two we have a little bit of an
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
agenda here we're going to first talk
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
about developmental Services then go
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
into healthy aging then discussed our
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
home and communitybased waivers and then
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit on financing for choices
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
for Independence and Nursing Facility so
 
01:05:57.630 --> 01:05:57.640 align:start position:0%
how how much time do you think you need
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
how much time would you like me to need
 
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
well I'm just curious you've got this in
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
your head how much if you just when I
 
01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
practiced this yesterday I needed 33
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
minutes but that wasn't with any
 
01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
questions right those questions darn
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
questions so is this the only
 
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
presentation today after after this this
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
is it right so okay so you're on I'm on
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
and what I thought I would do is maybe
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
go through each section and then at the
 
01:06:26.269 --> 01:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
end of each section pause to see if
 
01:06:28.829 --> 01:06:28.839 align:start position:0%
there's questions cuz if that works for
 
01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:32.799 align:start position:0%
you that okay so this um next slide
 
01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to see um a similar slide
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner Tilly used it a
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
little while ago um we used it again
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
when we met a week and a half ago and
 
01:06:46.589 --> 01:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
then when we did the department overview
 
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
and it's just really showing how we meet
 
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
the needs across the lifespan today I'm
 
01:06:54.269 --> 01:06:54.279 align:start position:0%
going to focus on older adults and some
 
01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
of our specialized populations I think
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
one of the things within our department
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
as we have talked about here we are a
 
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
large department but yet we're able to
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
leverage and connect individuals and
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
seamlessly So within developmental
 
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
Services is that okay if I keep on going
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
okay um I've been with the department
 
01:07:22.039 --> 01:07:22.990 align:start position:0%
okay um I've been with the department
since

01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
2016 prior to that I actually worked in
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
the developmental Services System for
 
01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:32.200 align:start position:0%
over 25 years and I think that brings a
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
Advantage um within the department
 
01:07:38.109 --> 01:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
because I understand the history of that
 
01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
system the
 
01:07:43.069 --> 01:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
complexities the people served and most
 
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
importantly um the people that serve
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
them so I think that brings a um a good
 
01:07:50.829 --> 01:07:50.839 align:start position:0%
perspective to us here within the
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
department you will see on the next
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
slide it's Slide Five
 
01:07:59.910 --> 01:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
the operating structure of Developmental
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
services and I think it's important um
 
01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
as we begin talking about um the
 
01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
different Services System that you
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
understand um how the system operates
 
01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit different than the
 
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
last time um we presented to the budget
 
01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
because we did have a change on July 1st
 
01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
2023 with how we operate but if you look
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
in your leftand corner all of our fund
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
we get um funding from the federal
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
government through the center of
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
Medicare and medicate services and it is
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
a 5050 match we use 50% General funds to
 
01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
get 50% Federal dollar those funds flow
 
01:08:47.149 --> 01:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Health and Human
 
01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
Services we work together closely with
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
our 10 area agencies we have 10 area
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
agencies throughout the state they are
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
private nonprofit organizations and
 
01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:01.159 align:start position:0%
they're designated um through the
 
01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
department they actually um provide with
 
01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
DHHS a shared governance for the system
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
we um work together for Quality
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
initiatives and also through the area
 
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
agencies they determine eligibility
 
01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.749 align:start position:0%
agencies they determine eligibility
under

01:09:18.749 --> 01:09:18.759 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
171a so if people apply for services
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
that is done through their local area
 
01:09:24.719 --> 01:09:26.229 align:start position:0%
that is done through their local area
agency

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
in turn we have service coordinators and
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
their role is to assist individuals and
 
01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
families with um accessing services that
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
meet the needs and the desires of that
 
01:09:42.510 --> 01:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
person and then in turn we have provider
 
01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:46.359 align:start position:0%
agencies that provide many of the Direct
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
Services what is unique is the provider
 
01:09:53.709 --> 01:09:53.719 align:start position:0%
agencies must be enrolled as a Medicaid
 
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
provider um and have the option to Bill
 
01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
directly for services an agency whether
 
01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:03.400 align:start position:0%
it's a service provider or an area
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
agency can provide Direct Services they
 
01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
can also provide Service Coordination
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
they just cannot do it for the same
 
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
person so that's very different than how
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
the system used to
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
be okay so you we you say we have 10
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
area agencies and they've been
 
01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
designated by
 
01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
DHHS so the the first time people hear
 
01:10:30.189 --> 01:10:30.199 align:start position:0%
that they may think well we got 10
 
01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
counties we have 10 area agencies but
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
the the the correlation isn't exact
 
01:10:38.189 --> 01:10:38.199 align:start position:0%
right correct right so so so that gets
 
01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
me to the question uh why 10 is is 10 a
 
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
magical number and would we save money
 
01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:49.400 align:start position:0%
if it were seven so there used to be 12
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
and back in
 
01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
around 2004 2006 we went from 12 to 10
 
01:10:59.070 --> 01:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
um and I think you and I have had this
 
01:11:02.110 --> 01:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
conversation a little bit if we um went
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
from 10 to 7 I don't think you would
 
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
redo have there would be any savings it
 
01:11:09.149 --> 01:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
would be very minimal
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
because area agencies are paid through a
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
designated area agency rate and that is
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
based on the individual receiving
 
01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
services so that would continue
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
regardless as to how many agencies you
 
01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
had good good answer so Serv service
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
coordinators um do we have a an
 
01:11:33.149 --> 01:11:33.159 align:start position:0%
approximate number of how many service
 
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
coordinators we we work with it feels
 
01:11:38.629 --> 01:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
like 8090 something no there's about
 
01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
8090 service providers there's less
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
Service Coordination
 
01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
agencies o okay and and that the number
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
of service coordinators probably doesn't
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
have a direct budget impact because it
 
01:11:57.629 --> 01:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
the the money money that pays them is
 
01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
basically built into the fees that are
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
being transferred we we have a rate for
 
01:12:04.990 --> 01:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
Service Coordination we have a separate
 
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate for that so correct right
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
so if somebody's looking just grossly at
 
01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
how we can make this more efficient
 
01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
changing the number of area agencies
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
trying to change the number of service
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
coordinators this would have very little
 
01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
impact very little impact okay and it
 
01:12:25.629 --> 01:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
could do some harm right if you yes take
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
capacity out of the system 100% okay and
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
then what tell the provider agencies
 
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
tell tell us again or tell me again what
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
what we mean by a provider so that would
 
01:12:39.629 --> 01:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
be somebody who provides the direct
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
service they could provide day Services
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
supported employment some of them
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
provide residential services so it's the
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's the services that is outlined in
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
someone's service agreement the service
 
01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
provider is the one that would provide
 
01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
that all right thank you you're welcome
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
any questions there no okay um so next
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn over to our road map
 
01:13:06.669 --> 01:13:06.679 align:start position:0%
um and one of our goals under commitment
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
to under promote thriving communities is
 
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
to strengthen the developmental Services
 
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
System um I'm going to on the next slide
 
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk a little bit about
 
01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
where we've been but this is where we
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
want to be going and really if you look
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
at the the middle part of the Circle you
 
01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
see an individual and they have outcomes
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
and and what the values we ascribe to
 
01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
within the system are Choice uniformity
 
01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
sustainability and quality and then the
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
outside ring here are um what is needed
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
to support that within the structure of
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
Developmental services so what is choice
 
01:13:52.629 --> 01:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
mean that means that the individual has
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
a choice as to who will provide their
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
Services what services They will receive
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
often times maybe the staff person that
 
01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
will provide
 
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
that um uniformity
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
means where you live should not matter
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
what services are offered to you that it
 
01:14:12.629 --> 01:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
should be the same if I live in
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
Claremont I should have access to the
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
same services that someone in conquered
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
has um Quality is what we're providing
 
01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
of quality are we hitting the mark are
 
01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
we doing what we said we would do and
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
then sustainability and I think that's
 
01:14:32.189 --> 01:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
where um you were kind of going
 
01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards is are we using
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
the funding that is committed to to this
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
system is it based on actual costs can
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
we predict it for the future that's
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
sustainability um the next slide we talk
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit about where we've been um
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
and the Investments we've made in
 
01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
developmental services from about 2016
 
01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.189 align:start position:0%
developmental services from about 2016
to

01:15:00.189 --> 01:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
2023 we were under Federal compliance
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
with a corrective action plan and I
 
01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
believe we talked a little bit about
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
this in the last budget session um we
 
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
were out of compliance for a direct Bill
 
01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:15.400 align:start position:0%
provision as well as conflict of
 
01:15:17.229 --> 01:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
interest in case
 
01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
management we have met this compliant um
 
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
July 1st
 
01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:25.400 align:start position:0%
2023 we were found to be compliant in
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
both areas and so what that means is we
 
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
had a number of initiatives we wanted to
 
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
do to strengthen the system to think
 
01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
about the future for individuals and
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
families but we couldn't get to it until
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
we put compliance behind us and so we
 
01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
took a pause in
 
01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:48.679 align:start position:0%
2024 instead of moving right towards
 
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
system strengthening of stopping and
 
01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
listening to individuals and families
 
01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
and the providers that support them so
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
we came up with shared values as to
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
what's important as we move forward in
 
01:16:04.189 --> 01:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
the developmental Services System we had
 
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
a number of family forums we had a
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
number of information sessions and we
 
01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
had a number of surveys that we did to
 
01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
say hey what do what's important for you
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
as a family member as we move forward um
 
01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
to strengthen the system service
 
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
providers what's important for you for
 
01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
area agencies for service coordinators
 
01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
we worked with everybody to make sure we
 
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
all came to agreement on what our our
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
values going to be moving forward and
 
01:16:37.709 --> 01:16:37.719 align:start position:0%
what are the priorities that we need to
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
work on for the system which you will
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
see on your next
 
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
slide get a little sip of water
 
01:16:49.229 --> 01:16:49.239 align:start position:0%
here so we came together and the four
 
01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
primary areas that actually overlaid
 
01:16:55.709 --> 01:16:55.719 align:start position:0%
between individuals and Families service
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
providers area agencies all had these
 
01:17:02.110 --> 01:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
four areas in a core and that was
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
communication and information how do
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
individuals and families access
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
information how can we as a department
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
provide them with information prior to
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
having some of the it changes we made
 
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
the department didn't have that capacity
 
01:17:21.149 --> 01:17:21.159 align:start position:0%
to communicate directly with individuals
 
01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
and families we updated our website to
 
01:17:25.950 --> 01:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
make it family friendly so that the
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
information they need is on our website
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
we decided that we really need to invest
 
01:17:34.709 --> 01:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
in our Workforce this is an area where
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
it's people helping people if we don't
 
01:17:40.229 --> 01:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
have the people to help the people then
 
01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
people will not get services and so we
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
did a number of things we um using 100%
 
01:17:49.629 --> 01:17:49.639 align:start position:0%
Federal homing communitybased
 
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
reinvestment funds we distributed about
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
15. um6 $6 million of federal funds to
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
help 45 organizations develop Workforce
 
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
grants to focus on retention um training
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
and ways to um recruit staff we also um
 
01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
worked on training and development um
 
01:18:15.790 --> 01:18:15.800 align:start position:0%
what type of training do providers need
 
01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
so that they are able to meet the needs
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
of the individuals they serve and then
 
01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
access to Services what is included on
 
01:18:26.629 --> 01:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
our waiver how do you access the waiver
 
01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
services and provided some of that
 
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
information so families understand
 
01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
access of of those Workforce
 
01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
Investments what what seems to be
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely brilliant that we're glad
 
01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
we're doing it's it's so obvious it's
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
paying off I think there's a there's a
 
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of different ones and I know
 
01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
um Melissa Hardy is collecting a lot of
 
01:18:57.629 --> 01:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
that information but some um agencies
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
have done targeted recruitment like I've
 
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
seen ads on TV to try to access to
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
really show this is the work of a direct
 
01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
support professional this is why it's
 
01:19:10.149 --> 01:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
important to me other ones have invested
 
01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
in training and bringing on
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
credentialing some of their new
 
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
Workforce so that they stay and are
 
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
invested in the organization so there's
 
01:19:21.709 --> 01:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
a whole variety we can actually provide
 
01:19:24.910 --> 01:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
you a summary if that would be helpful
 
01:19:26.669 --> 01:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
okay and then implied in the way I
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
phrase that question is are there are
 
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
there any Investments we've attempted
 
01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
that don't appear to be adding the value
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
we had hoped for and we don't need to
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
talk about yeah I don't know off the top
 
01:19:41.149 --> 01:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
of my head but we can get that for you
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
all right thank
 
01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
you representative Daniels thank you in
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
response to the uh survey that you do
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
yeah what's your what's your response
 
01:19:55.229 --> 01:19:55.239 align:start position:0%
rate it was actually um it was
 
01:19:57.629 --> 01:19:57.639 align:start position:0%
probably it was around 500 individuals
 
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
and families but that was on top of the
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
actual um forums that we
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
had okay and and it it's just something
 
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
that's put out there where someone can
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
go and yeah what we advertised it a
 
01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
really well we um talked about it in any
 
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
of the sessions we had so we tried to
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
make sure people filled it out you know
 
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
um but we also did a lot of work with
 
01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
having individual forums in the
 
01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
different parts of the state and it was
 
01:20:29.550 --> 01:20:29.560 align:start position:0%
really important and we used a location
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
where Department staff could be there
 
01:20:33.390 --> 01:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
and to hear from families and that's
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
where we got a lot of really good
 
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
information in those one-on-one
 
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
you okay so our next um area is on the
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
next slide and it's really looking
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
at assessment assessment informs rate
 
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:57.719 align:start position:0%
rates as a commitment to
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
uniformity and so one of the things
 
01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
within our developmental Services System
 
01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
is we do not really have a systemic way
 
01:21:13.149 --> 01:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
to match an individual's need with their
 
01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
service authorization which makes it
 
01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
really difficult for us to ensure that
 
01:21:21.629 --> 01:21:21.639 align:start position:0%
everybody's getting the same access
 
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
based on their needs it also makes it
 
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
really difficult for us to predict our
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
Budget moving forward and
 
01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
to use our taxpayer dollars in the way
 
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
that they were intended and so one of
 
01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:41.239 align:start position:0%
the areas that we did is we had an
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
assessment a few years ago and um it was
 
01:21:47.629 --> 01:21:47.639 align:start position:0%
shared with us that if we move towards
 
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
potentially doing assessment informed
 
01:21:54.629 --> 01:21:54.639 align:start position:0%
rates where somebody's need is tied to
 
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
um the resource allocation that is a way
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
for greater efficiencies it creates
 
01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
standardization across the state but it
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
also helps us predict our dollars more
 
01:22:09.149 --> 01:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
effectively so we are starting to go
 
01:22:12.669 --> 01:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
down that road um but as part of that we
 
01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
had to develop rates and so over the
 
01:22:18.669 --> 01:22:18.679 align:start position:0%
last year and a half two years we have
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
worked with a contractor Meyers and
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
stoffer to help us develop rates what is
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
the true cost of services based on cost
 
01:22:31.149 --> 01:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
reports if you put the individual
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
providing the services at the center
 
01:22:36.189 --> 01:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
because in developmental services and
 
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
many of our helping Services you really
 
01:22:42.189 --> 01:22:42.199 align:start position:0%
need to understand what is the cost of
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
the worker to do the work and so we um
 
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
have had a significant stakeholder
 
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
engagement we've had about 39 to 40
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
different rate work groups that includes
 
01:22:59.709 --> 01:22:59.719 align:start position:0%
providers individuals families um area
 
01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
agencies service providers all around
 
01:23:05.629 --> 01:23:05.639 align:start position:0%
looking at how would we develop
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
rates we have put in as a um prioritize
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
need in our agency budget the cost to
 
01:23:16.590 --> 01:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
phase in those rates and I think
 
01:23:18.510 --> 01:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards when you were
 
01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
talking earlier um when commissioner
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
Tilly was presenting about you know some
 
01:23:27.629 --> 01:23:27.639 align:start position:0%
of those preventative Services how we
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
phase in the rates if they were funded
 
01:23:33.149 --> 01:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
is we are we would be starting with
 
01:23:36.189 --> 01:23:36.199 align:start position:0%
those services that helps keep an
 
01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
individual at home with their family so
 
01:23:41.709 --> 01:23:41.719 align:start position:0%
services that help people to stay
 
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
independent and need less costly
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
residential services so ultimately our
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
goal would be by increasing those rates
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
making that um attractive for provid
 
01:23:57.030 --> 01:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
providers to participate in more and
 
01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
more people hopefully would take
 
01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
advantage of some of those lower cost
 
01:24:05.070 --> 01:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
Services thus delaying the need for more
 
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
costly services our goal would be over
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
time this would actually stabilize the
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
budget and not have it be um such an
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
year representative Daniels thank you
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
does the client contribute to the cost
 
01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
the client um covers their own room and
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
board um they cover some of their
 
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
spending money um some of their other
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
benefits but aside from that we build
 
01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
Services representative Stringham so
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
these uh these rates are all within the
 
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh developmental disability waiver is
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
that correct and and are they similar to
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
any other services or any other Medicaid
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
Program so how if if were to get these
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
rates we would then put them into the
 
01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid waiver as part of our work to
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
develop the rates you have to ensure
 
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
parity with other services that are
 
01:25:08.430 --> 01:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
similar in another part of Medicaid okay
 
01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:11.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um the um are you finding
 
01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
anywhere where uh the rates
 
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
are generous or is everything kind of
 
01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
um more likely to be increased in cost
 
01:25:27.149 --> 01:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
than than then decrease yeah there
 
01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a
 
01:25:33.109 --> 01:25:33.119 align:start position:0%
decrease thank you but I guess the
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
I there wouldn't be a decrease in the
 
01:25:38.910 --> 01:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
rates but if when we move and Implement
 
01:25:41.109 --> 01:25:41.119 align:start position:0%
if we are able to the assessment and
 
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:43.400 align:start position:0%
form rates we are going we have we would
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
better be able to align with what a
 
01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
person's assessed need is with the
 
01:25:51.109 --> 01:25:51.119 align:start position:0%
service authorization they reive we
 
01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
don't have that mechanism today so I
 
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
can't say that okay if these were to be
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
funded you would see a change
 
01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
immediately but I do believe you would
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
see a change over
 
01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
time I I I think what you would also see
 
01:26:09.629 --> 01:26:09.639 align:start position:0%
um as Chris had alluded to earlier is
 
01:26:09.639 --> 01:26:10.590 align:start position:0%
um as Chris had alluded to earlier is
less

01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
variability um and I think in the long
 
01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
run too when it comes to when it comes
 
01:26:17.709 --> 01:26:17.719 align:start position:0%
to the budget accuracy is really
 
01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
important so that you don't over budget
 
01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
and by having more standardized rates
 
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
that would allow us to budget more
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
accurately so so maybe you would have
 
01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
extra money or money that you wouldn't
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
need to budget because you you you'd
 
01:26:31.470 --> 01:26:31.480 align:start position:0%
have a higher level of assurity there
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
that could be used elsewhere so it's
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily only the question
 
01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
of are you going to spend less but are
 
01:26:39.229 --> 01:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
you going to budget what you're going to
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
spend I think is really key there and
 
01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:42.119 align:start position:0%
that's been that's been one of the
 
01:26:42.119 --> 01:26:44.350 align:start position:0%
that's been that's been one of the
challenges

01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
historically um be uh because we have to
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
reserve that money right corre for this
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
program yes thank you so so I'm looking
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
at the the fourth block there where it's
 
01:26:58.350 --> 01:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
it's got the bullet that says uh with
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
budget approval and I'm thinking about
 
01:27:03.109 --> 01:27:03.119 align:start position:0%
what I think I heard you say when when
 
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
you said that you in order to do the
 
01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:10.280 align:start position:0%
rate phase in you may need some
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
additional money and it and that
 
01:27:14.590 --> 01:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
additional money will show up probably
 
01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
in a prioritized need yes okay so so
 
01:27:21.229 --> 01:27:21.239 align:start position:0%
when the time is right I'd like to
 
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
really understand why you need money to
 
01:27:27.629 --> 01:27:27.639 align:start position:0%
do a rate phas in okay I think Melissa
 
01:27:29.550 --> 01:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
will definitely include that in her
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
budget presentation but we can also sit
 
01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:34.280 align:start position:0%
down and review that if you'd like yeah
 
01:27:37.390 --> 01:27:37.400 align:start position:0%
because simp my simple thought is you
 
01:27:39.550 --> 01:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
just you take this rate and you turn it
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
this way and take this rate and turn it
 
01:27:43.270 --> 01:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
this way and then boom you've got your
 
01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:45.719 align:start position:0%
rate adjustment and that didn't cost you
 
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
anything okay so it's got to be more
 
01:27:51.669 --> 01:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
complex but don't forget when we develop
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
these rates we actually receive cost
 
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
reports from providers we worked with
 
01:27:59.390 --> 01:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
providers to say what is the cost for
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
direct support professional so some of
 
01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
these rates we would look to phase in
 
01:28:06.109 --> 01:28:06.119 align:start position:0%
early haven't been looked at for years
 
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
all right so we we have something to
 
01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
look forward to there yes you do yes sir
 
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
I I think one important thing
 
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
particularly for new members um when we
 
01:28:17.149 --> 01:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
are when we are talking about the DD
 
01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
budget there's three accounts and for
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
the current bium it's total funds of
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
about $900 million so so when you are
 
01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the HHS budget I think it's
 
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
just important to recognize that this is
 
01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
a large portion so when you make
 
01:28:33.310 --> 01:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
adjustments to a rate here or there when
 
01:28:35.229 --> 01:28:35.239 align:start position:0%
we're talking about um you know this
 
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
area being a large um a large dollar
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
amount that that will have impacts um to
 
01:28:46.109 --> 01:28:46.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
areas okay so that's developmental
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
services so before I move on to healthy
 
01:28:55.149 --> 01:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
aging do you have any other questions I
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
I do I I would you would you feel
 
01:29:02.590 --> 01:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
comfortable hearing the DD Community the
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
DD part of this budget
 
01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
described as the part of the budget that
 
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:12.280 align:start position:0%
uh attempts to address the needs of New
 
01:29:14.830 --> 01:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's most vulnerable
 
01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
citizens I I would say individuals with
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
disabilities are some of New Hampshire's
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable citizens yes all right
 
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
okay so now we're g to move on to health
 
01:29:34.109 --> 01:29:34.119 align:start position:0%
go for so um healthy aging if you see
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
this first slide this is demographics as
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
to why do we need to focus on healthy
 
01:29:44.430 --> 01:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
aging as a state um New Hampshire is one
 
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
of the SEC is the second oldest state in
 
01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
the country not as as long as we've been
 
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
here but
 
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
demographically um and nearly 20% of New
 
01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population is age 65 and
 
01:30:02.350 --> 01:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
over and 35% of our population is age 55
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
and over and so um it behooves us as a
 
01:30:11.470 --> 01:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
state to focus on how do we support
 
01:30:14.189 --> 01:30:14.199 align:start position:0%
those that are older adults to age in
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
place at home receive the services they
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
need at home and delay any further more
 
01:30:25.709 --> 01:30:25.719 align:start position:0%
extensive um services and so in um the
 
01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
last budget we received um funding and a
 
01:30:33.149 --> 01:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
charge to develop a system of care for
 
01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
healthy aging and really what that
 
01:30:38.390 --> 01:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
system of care of healthy aging which is
 
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
described on the visualized on the next
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
slide is a comprehensive and coordinated
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
system of care that promotes healthy
 
01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
aging and enables adults who are older
 
01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
and adults with disabilities have
 
01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
meaning full choice and care options in
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
their homes and in their communities and
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
if you look at this little visual here
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
this is the vision for the system of
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
care for healthy aging and it's not just
 
01:31:09.070 --> 01:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
what the Department of Health and Human
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
Services is using as a visual it's also
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
what this um State Commission on Aging
 
01:31:17.229 --> 01:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
is using what the alliance for healthy
 
01:31:19.990 --> 01:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
aging is using so that we're all working
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
together with a common goal and if you
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
look at the Outer Circle there's a
 
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
number of services and supports and some
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
of these services are preventative in
 
01:31:35.070 --> 01:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
nature and so I think about the meals
 
01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
and nutrition programs in 2024 through
 
01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
the department 15,000 people received
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
Meals on Wheels in the state of those
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
15,000 people 61% of them said that was
 
01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
their primary source of nutrition for
 
01:32:00.510 --> 01:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
the day and also of those 15,000
 
01:32:03.870 --> 01:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
41% said the driver who delivered their
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
meals was the only person they saw
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
during the day so again it's one of
 
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
those social programs that has a focused
 
01:32:16.669 --> 01:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
area but it does such good to support
 
01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
older adults in our state we also have
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
in this Outer Circle abuse NE and
 
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
neglect um prevention and we do that in
 
01:32:28.510 --> 01:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
the department through our Adult
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
Protective Services Program which is um
 
01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
authorized under RSA 161 and it really
 
01:32:38.790 --> 01:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
ensures that vulnerable adults are not
 
01:32:41.550 --> 01:32:41.560 align:start position:0%
subject to abuse neglect and
 
01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
exploitation and so you see how some of
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
these services in the Outer Circle and
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
we use a combination of funding whether
 
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
it's state general funds whether it's
 
01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
old age assist
 
01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's older American act dollars
 
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
Administration for Community Living to
 
01:33:03.669 --> 01:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
really wrap services around somebody and
 
01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
then as you go into the green part of
 
01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
the circle those are locations that
 
01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
maybe is out of a person's home and so
 
01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
that the services on the outside weren't
 
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
enough to keep somebody at home so then
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
we needed more um Services whether
 
01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
that's through our nursing facilities or
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
waiver some of the work on the system of
 
01:33:32.830 --> 01:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
care has also helped us to ensure what
 
01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
you will see on the next slide is um
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
made we had to make some Financial
 
01:33:41.070 --> 01:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
eligibility changes made it a little bit
 
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
easier for people to access access
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services we got rid of the
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
spousal impoverishment which basically
 
01:33:54.189 --> 01:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
means that previously if you had a
 
01:33:57.790 --> 01:33:57.800 align:start position:0%
member a spouse that was living at home
 
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
they had to actually become impoverished
 
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
for their spouse to get services and we
 
01:34:05.070 --> 01:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
changed that knowing that that's really
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
not the right thing to do um who who is
 
01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
we it was actually the state of New
 
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as outlined in um hb2 last
 
01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
year so so that's an hb2 item so it's
 
01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
law now is that ongoing continuing law
 
01:34:22.510 --> 01:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
or was that just for the continued yes
 
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
okay um we increased the resource
 
01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
disregards um we also change the look
 
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
back period so prior to hb2 if you
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
applied for Medicaid you had to provide
 
01:34:40.350 --> 01:34:40.360 align:start position:0%
60 months of financial documents so
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
think of yourself if you are trying to
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
help a family member um to come up with
 
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
60 months of documents that you may not
 
01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
even know um accounts that your parent
 
01:34:53.709 --> 01:34:53.719 align:start position:0%
may have had so with and that was a
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
barrier for people to access services
 
01:34:59.390 --> 01:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
and so through hb2 with the system of
 
01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
care we're allowed to go back 36 months
 
01:35:05.790 --> 01:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
as long as if we do we do these data
 
01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
scans through um a verification system
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
as long as there aren't any red flags we
 
01:35:13.870 --> 01:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
can go ahead with a 36 months which
 
01:35:15.629 --> 01:35:15.639 align:start position:0%
really helps people get access to
 
01:35:15.639 --> 01:35:18.030 align:start position:0%
really helps people get access to
Services

01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
quicker represent Daniels on the
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Eligibility is isn't it still 5
 
01:35:27.149 --> 01:35:27.159 align:start position:0%
years to to get connected to Med
 
01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid on the look back period we've
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
switched that to 36 months as long as
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
there isn't when we do our um scans
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
through the databases that it doesn't
 
01:35:39.310 --> 01:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
look like there was a transfer of assets
 
01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
so if something is a red flag we will go
 
01:35:45.149 --> 01:35:45.159 align:start position:0%
and look beyond the 36 months but for
 
01:35:47.790 --> 01:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
the majority of people it's 36 months is
 
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
there a federal uh eligibility
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
requirement that people have to buy into
 
01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
we had we received Federal approval to
 
01:35:58.109 --> 01:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
do the
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
36 um month Lookout I'm just wondering
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
if somewhere along the line there there
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
isn't different
 
01:36:07.390 --> 01:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
qualifications 36 months for the state
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
or 60 for the federal it's we we're
 
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to do the 36 months with the
 
01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
federal appr understand what you're
 
01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
saying okay I'm asking is it still a
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
requirement federally of of five years
 
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
so so when the law was written um in hb2
 
01:36:26.709 --> 01:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
they amended RSA
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
1674 and in the in the state law it said
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
to the extent permissible F by federal
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
law where they changed it from 60 to 36
 
01:36:37.470 --> 01:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
months and we've since received approval
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
So currently it is compli
 
01:36:41.679 --> 01:36:47.189 align:start position:0%
So currently it is compli
it

01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
okay anything okay um we also um were
 
01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:53.679 align:start position:0%
required to do a choices for
 
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
Independence rate study to look at the
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
rates um for our choices for independent
 
01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
services to make sure they're
 
01:37:03.790 --> 01:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
competitive to keep people at home we um
 
01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
made a number of changes and are still
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
working on the changes to New Hampshire
 
01:37:11.790 --> 01:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
easy which is our gateway to Services um
 
01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
to ensure that individuals their
 
01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%
caregivers um and families can actually
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
access through our provider portal and
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
we've been able to use 100% Federal
 
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
funding to enhance um New Hampshire easy
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
and finally we expanded who could be a
 
01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
provider of personal care
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:38.109 --> 01:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
that okay so I'm going to move now into
 
01:37:41.109 --> 01:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
our home and Community Based waivers
 
01:37:41.119 --> 01:37:42.229 align:start position:0%
our home and Community Based waivers
that's

01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
okay under the division of long-term
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
supports and services we have four home
 
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
and community- based waivers these are
 
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
1915c waivers they are
 
01:37:59.470 --> 01:37:59.480 align:start position:0%
voluntary um we have to um show in the
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
aggregate of the waiver that it is cost
 
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
neutral so that the average cost is less
 
01:38:08.910 --> 01:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
on the waiver than it is in an
 
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
institution um that is required by
 
01:38:16.350 --> 01:38:16.360 align:start position:0%
CMS we have four different waivers we
 
01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
have the children's inhome support
 
01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
waiver and that is for children birth
 
01:38:24.669 --> 01:38:24.679 align:start position:0%
through the age of 21 they must live at
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
home with their families um and they
 
01:38:29.790 --> 01:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
have to still be in school for this
 
01:38:32.709 --> 01:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
service it is family directed which
 
01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:35.320 align:start position:0%
means the families really direct how the
 
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
services occur in their home and all of
 
01:38:41.229 --> 01:38:41.239 align:start position:0%
the services are based out of the
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
person's home we have our developmental
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
disability waiver which is our largest
 
01:38:50.229 --> 01:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
waiver and that is primarily um those
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
who have exited the school system and
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
that's where some someone will receive
 
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
day Services residential respit
 
01:39:01.470 --> 01:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
Employment Services to remain
 
01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
independent and then we have our
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
acquired brain disorder service um
 
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
waiver and that's for those ages 22 to
 
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
60 so that I know it's confusing right
 
01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
so that means that their brain injury
 
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
had to occur after the age of 22 if it
 
01:39:21.310 --> 01:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
occurred before that age then they would
 
01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
be served under the developmental
 
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
disability waiver because that would be
 
01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:27.679 align:start position:0%
considered a developmental disability
 
01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
because it occurred while you were
 
01:39:33.189 --> 01:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
developing and then it ends at age 60
 
01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
because then you would go under the
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
choices for Independence waiver and then
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
we have our choices for Independence
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
waiver any questions on
 
01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
these okay sorry I have a quick question
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
can you just explain to me the the
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
average cost per year column and what
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
those figures mean yep so if for for the
 
01:40:04.990 --> 01:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
$460 children on the inhome support
 
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
waiver the average cost is about
 
01:40:11.550 --> 01:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
$14,000 that um waiver is capped at
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
35,000 so it cannot exceed that
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
amount developmental disability we serve
 
01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
just under 6,000 people and that average
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
cost is $73,000
 
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
um there are a high number of
 
01:40:30.669 --> 01:40:30.679 align:start position:0%
residential services on the DD waiver
 
01:40:33.629 --> 01:40:33.639 align:start position:0%
which actually makes the cost go up that
 
01:40:35.870 --> 01:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
is one of the areas when we talked
 
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
earlier about the rate work that we want
 
01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
to get standardization and uniformity to
 
01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:51.470 align:start position:0%
 
costs

01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
okay repr Str yeah and then how many in
 
01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
the other two programs so on the
 
01:40:59.550 --> 01:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
acquired brain disorder we serve about
 
01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:04.679 align:start position:0%
235 people and for CFI about 39,000 I
 
01:41:07.629 --> 01:41:07.639 align:start position:0%
mean 3900
 
01:41:11.550 --> 01:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
sorry and um you just in in digging into
 
01:41:15.790 --> 01:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
the rates is there any you know um um
 
01:41:17.149 --> 01:41:17.159 align:start position:0%
you know my understanding of the way
 
01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
these things work is this is a service
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
somebody needs and this is how much it
 
01:41:25.589 --> 01:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
costs and I can imagine that there are
 
01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
services in there that are relatively
 
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
inexpensive that they may find extremely
 
01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
valuable and ones that cost more that
 
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
you know maybe they don't feel as
 
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
strongly about is there any ability
 
01:41:42.109 --> 01:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
Within These waiver
 
01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
programs uh to tailor them somewhat so
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
that the um you know the cost to the
 
01:41:52.709 --> 01:41:52.719 align:start position:0%
state may be lower but the value to the
 
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
recipient would be higher I think that's
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
where we were looking at some of the
 
01:42:00.510 --> 01:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
rate work and when Melissa presents um
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
later this month or early next month she
 
01:42:05.189 --> 01:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
can kind of go over some of those but we
 
01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
really want to incentivize or encourage
 
01:42:12.910 --> 01:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
um some of the services the rates that
 
01:42:15.229 --> 01:42:15.239 align:start position:0%
keep people at home keep people
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
independent and right now those rates
 
01:42:19.229 --> 01:42:19.239 align:start position:0%
are really low but we think there's
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
great value to them because the longer
 
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
somebody can stay independent stay with
 
01:42:26.709 --> 01:42:26.719 align:start position:0%
their family live on their own then
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to need less Residential
 
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
definitely representative
 
01:42:40.149 --> 01:42:40.159 align:start position:0%
PRI thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions back on page 15
 
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
again the number of people that you have
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
been able to provide service in home inh
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
home supports what was that oh sorry
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:42:58.669 --> 01:42:58.679 align:start position:0%
460 Children and Families okay and what
 
01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
about developmental disability um
 
01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
welcome so um one of the ways questions
 
01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
I think you had prior to us presenting
 
01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
is how do we measure performance and I
 
01:43:21.390 --> 01:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
know Meredith tus um was here talking
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
about the division of program quality
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
quality and integrity and so there's
 
01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:29.639 align:start position:0%
many ways that we partner actually with
 
01:43:32.030 --> 01:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
um that division within the department
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
so you take the program staff who really
 
01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
understand the program you take the
 
01:43:38.990 --> 01:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
program quality and integrity that
 
01:43:41.149 --> 01:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
understand quality and working together
 
01:43:43.870 --> 01:43:43.880 align:start position:0%
how do we ensure the services we provide
 
01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
are quality and that we're doing um what
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
the individuals and families need so we
 
01:43:52.189 --> 01:43:52.199 align:start position:0%
have a variety of ways that we measure
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
performance um I won't go over all of
 
01:43:57.189 --> 01:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
them you have them on your slides but
 
01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
because we have a Medicaid waiver um we
 
01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
have to provide certain financial and
 
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
service quality assurances to um the
 
01:44:06.750 --> 01:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
center for Medicare and Medicaid
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
services we do file reviews we do
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
governance audits we have providers
 
01:44:16.030 --> 01:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
report adverse um incidents that happen
 
01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
and then we have follow up to make sure
 
01:44:20.589 --> 01:44:20.599 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen again and the
 
01:44:23.470 --> 01:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
incident was corrected um through
 
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
developmental Services we use the
 
01:44:28.990 --> 01:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
national core indicators which actually
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
measures a person's experience receiving
 
01:44:33.669 --> 01:44:33.679 align:start position:0%
Services because that's really important
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
to understand um and then we just
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
started doing that for the Bureau of
 
01:44:41.950 --> 01:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
aging and adult Services um we also make
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
sure that services are provided as
 
01:44:47.189 --> 01:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
authorized was there an authorization
 
01:44:51.310 --> 01:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
before a service was um claimed and then
 
01:44:53.629 --> 01:44:53.639 align:start position:0%
um were the actions taken
 
01:44:58.109 --> 01:44:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:58.119 --> 01:44:59.790 align:start position:0%
 
resolved

01:44:59.790 --> 01:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
01:45:02.990 --> 01:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
questions yes so uh thanks for taking my
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you um on slide 15 so
 
01:45:09.149 --> 01:45:09.159 align:start position:0%
just so just so I'm
 
01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
clear this is uh uh represent what what
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
year this is fiscal year 24 fiscal year
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
24 and the same kind of a question the
 
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
the numbers that you have here are they
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
relatively stable over a period of years
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
or they increasing decreasing in these
 
01:45:29.310 --> 01:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
categories or is that something I can
 
01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
find um we
 
01:45:34.669 --> 01:45:34.679 align:start position:0%
do you will start to see on the fiscal
 
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
dashboard the developmental Services
 
01:45:38.669 --> 01:45:38.679 align:start position:0%
numbers we had to take a break because
 
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
we had some it system changes the the
 
01:45:46.350 --> 01:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
acquired brain disorder population stays
 
01:45:48.990 --> 01:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
pretty consistent um the children's
 
01:45:52.149 --> 01:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
inhome support is also pretty consistent
 
01:45:54.669 --> 01:45:54.679 align:start position:0%
because we just a a limited amount of
 
01:45:57.709 --> 01:45:57.719 align:start position:0%
services where you'll see growth um is
 
01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
through developmental Services because
 
01:46:03.550 --> 01:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
as kids leave the school system then
 
01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
they need Services right so we always
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
have a feeder to towards the services
 
01:46:11.109 --> 01:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
and then for choices for Independence
 
01:46:13.229 --> 01:46:13.239 align:start position:0%
we've seen a little bit of growth over
 
01:46:15.189 --> 01:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
the years and our goal is to continue to
 
01:46:17.109 --> 01:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
grow that
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:27.229 --> 01:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
you 18 now um I think I am so we're
 
01:46:30.030 --> 01:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
going to talk about financing and um
 
01:46:32.070 --> 01:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
Nursing Facility but I did want to
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
answer representative Daniel's question
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
from when we did the overview you asked
 
01:46:42.189 --> 01:46:42.199 align:start position:0%
about Nursing Facility um eligibility um
 
01:46:46.030 --> 01:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
and so typically what happens is if
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
somebody is determined that they would
 
01:46:50.109 --> 01:46:50.119 align:start position:0%
like to go to a nursing home they need
 
01:46:52.550 --> 01:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
to go into nursing home um they usually
 
01:46:54.910 --> 01:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
start with the financial eligibility
 
01:46:57.709 --> 01:46:57.719 align:start position:0%
first because that is the most
 
01:47:01.070 --> 01:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
extensive then once that is close to
 
01:47:03.229 --> 01:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
being resolved then we do the medical
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
assessment to make sure you're meeting
 
01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
that level of care sometimes we can do
 
01:47:09.229 --> 01:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
it at the same time depends what's going
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
on usually families come with a facility
 
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
in mind or then that's when they start
 
01:47:17.950 --> 01:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
to look for facilities to see who may
 
01:47:20.669 --> 01:47:20.679 align:start position:0%
have an available bed often times a
 
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
nursing facility until someone has
 
01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
Medicaid isn't going to want to accept
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
the person because they need them to
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
have Medicaid so once the person has
 
01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid once the nursing facility says
 
01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
yes we have a bed we can take this
 
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
person then we do a change of status
 
01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
form that then tells the department the
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
nursing facility submits that so then
 
01:47:44.109 --> 01:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
the department knows it's okay to bill
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:53.470 --> 01:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
servicee great
 
01:47:56.030 --> 01:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
um so we were asked to provide a high
 
01:47:59.669 --> 01:47:59.679 align:start position:0%
level overview of the financing um for
 
01:48:01.310 --> 01:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
the nursing facilities and choices for
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
Independence program accounting unit
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
2152 this is a really important one and
 
01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
and part of the reason that we want to
 
01:48:10.189 --> 01:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
talk about this early is you're going to
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
see this again but it's not the most
 
01:48:14.589 --> 01:48:14.599 align:start position:0%
straightforward um funding mechanism and
 
01:48:16.109 --> 01:48:16.119 align:start position:0%
I think it's really important to
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
understand um so accounting into at 2152
 
01:48:21.149 --> 01:48:21.159 align:start position:0%
uh for this year I think we're at about
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
$380 million so this is a single
 
01:48:25.950 --> 01:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
accounting unit and it pays for a couple
 
01:48:27.950 --> 01:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
of key Services number one is the
 
01:48:30.510 --> 01:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
choices for Independence program is it
 
01:48:32.709 --> 01:48:32.719 align:start position:0%
paid it's paid out of that out of class
 
01:48:34.910 --> 01:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
506 and this is not the first time or
 
01:48:35.950 --> 01:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
this is not the last time we're going to
 
01:48:37.950 --> 01:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
talk about this I'm sure and then
 
01:48:40.030 --> 01:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
there's also the nursing home payment
 
01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
line that's class 504 and what that
 
01:48:45.390 --> 01:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
represents is it represents the payments
 
01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
um for Medicaid eligible individuals
 
01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
that are in nursing facilities within
 
01:48:52.950 --> 01:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
the state and the slide before you shows
 
01:48:56.750 --> 01:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh how how the funding mix Works in in
 
01:48:59.310 --> 01:48:59.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um so there's a federal
 
01:49:02.109 --> 01:49:02.119 align:start position:0%
match it's approximately 50% and you'll
 
01:49:05.109 --> 01:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
see the the blue uh the blue piece of
 
01:49:07.550 --> 01:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
the pie there that's the federal funds
 
01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
now there's also a portion of that that
 
01:49:11.589 --> 01:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
are state general funds and then there's
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
also County funds and we're going to
 
01:49:15.950 --> 01:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
talk about this more but we're talking
 
01:49:20.910 --> 01:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
about the county cap and RSA 1671
 
01:49:24.030 --> 01:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
18a within that stat statute there is
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
the county cap and what that is it's
 
01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
basically a fixed dollar amount that the
 
01:49:30.870 --> 01:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
legislature every 2 years determines
 
01:49:32.830 --> 01:49:32.840 align:start position:0%
that this is going to be the amount that
 
01:49:36.270 --> 01:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
the counties will contribute towards um
 
01:49:39.229 --> 01:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
these CFI and Nursing Facility
 
01:49:42.669 --> 01:49:42.679 align:start position:0%
payments and um typically that that's
 
01:49:44.910 --> 01:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
adjusted by hb2 I don't know if it's
 
01:49:47.109 --> 01:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
ever been adjusted else in other in any
 
01:49:48.589 --> 01:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
other piece of legislation but you'll
 
01:49:50.589 --> 01:49:50.599 align:start position:0%
see that show up in hb2 and I'm sure
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
once the governor's budget comes out
 
01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
we'll have an opportunity to go over
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
that section there's also a credit in
 
01:49:59.550 --> 01:49:59.560 align:start position:0%
statute the credit by default is $5
 
01:50:02.229 --> 01:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
million and in certain years that credit
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
has been increased and other years it's
 
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
been slightly lower so I think it's been
 
01:50:09.310 --> 01:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
as high as $1 million and I think maybe
 
01:50:11.550 --> 01:50:11.560 align:start position:0%
as low as three I can't recall up my
 
01:50:14.669 --> 01:50:14.679 align:start position:0%
head and so what you'll end up seeing in
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
the actual accounting unit is you will
 
01:50:20.189 --> 01:50:20.199 align:start position:0%
not see the county cap figure in the
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
accounting unit what you will see is
 
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see the county cap figure plus
 
01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
with the credit applied so it'll be
 
01:50:30.709 --> 01:50:30.719 align:start position:0%
about $5 million less um there was also
 
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
an element of Statute that was added a
 
01:50:34.270 --> 01:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
few years ago that limits the growth of
 
01:50:37.790 --> 01:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
the county cap by 2% each year what we
 
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
found though in the past couple of years
 
01:50:42.990 --> 01:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
is we have seen expenses moving at a
 
01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
higher rate than just 2% so you will see
 
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
when you do um I I if if you do look at
 
01:50:51.310 --> 01:50:51.320 align:start position:0%
the agency budget that was previously
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
submitted you will see the those General
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
funds increasing at a fairly High rate
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
um certain certainly not at at a 2% rate
 
01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
by any means because the cost of care um
 
01:51:04.990 --> 01:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
in in the medical field has um seen some
 
01:51:06.669 --> 01:51:06.679 align:start position:0%
pretty high inflation over the past
 
01:51:08.990 --> 01:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
couple of years so that's a very high
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
level overview of this I don't know how
 
01:51:12.750 --> 01:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
deep you want to go I have handouts if
 
01:51:15.149 --> 01:51:15.159 align:start position:0%
you want to take 15 or 20 minutes or we
 
01:51:16.709 --> 01:51:16.719 align:start position:0%
can pick it up another day and touch on
 
01:51:21.189 --> 01:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:23.950 --> 01:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
services let's look at your uh graphic
 
01:51:26.189 --> 01:51:26.199 align:start position:0%
that you want to hand out and then uh
 
01:51:28.109 --> 01:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
just take we'll just look at it real
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
quick and we'll get a sense of I'll get
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
a sense of whether or not we should go
 
01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
into the detail sure it's it's a
 
01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
two-page detailed
 
01:51:38.189 --> 01:51:38.199 align:start position:0%
explanation okay if if we want to go
 
01:51:39.950 --> 01:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
through that let's hand it out give
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
people a chance to read it and then um
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
the next time you come in to talk about
 
01:51:48.069 --> 01:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
this subject well we should be better
 
01:51:56.109 --> 01:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:58.350 --> 01:51:58.360 align:start position:0%
and and so I think this may come close
 
01:52:00.430 --> 01:52:00.440 align:start position:0%
to getting ready to conclude what we're
 
01:52:03.189 --> 01:52:03.199 align:start position:0%
going to do and I uh commissioner Weaver
 
01:52:05.629 --> 01:52:05.639 align:start position:0%
I see you back there do you do you do
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
you want to say anything I I want to
 
01:52:10.629 --> 01:52:10.639 align:start position:0%
give you the the privilege of saying
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
something if you want about what we've
 
01:52:18.109 --> 01:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:20.910 --> 01:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
whatever yeah no you can't hide they
 
01:52:22.750 --> 01:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
they were all pointing at you earlier do
 
01:52:24.669 --> 01:52:24.679 align:start position:0%
you want to use the microphone at the
 
01:52:29.310 --> 01:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
table thank you thank you for the
 
01:52:33.229 --> 01:52:33.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity I don't have anything
 
01:52:35.589 --> 01:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
further to add right now but thank you
 
01:52:37.390 --> 01:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you for
 
01:52:40.030 --> 01:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
coming uh representative yeah have one
 
01:52:43.149 --> 01:52:43.159 align:start position:0%
quick question uh Mr White yeah uh
 
01:52:46.270 --> 01:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
thanks uh for the presentation and
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the pie charts uh on the
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
county funding is that an a you is that
 
01:52:54.870 --> 01:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
the same for all counties or is that an
 
01:53:00.109 --> 01:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
average or sure so the the reason that I
 
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
handed out a two-page detail explanation
 
01:53:04.350 --> 01:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
is be because that starts to get down in
 
01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
the details there what we do is we look
 
01:53:08.189 --> 01:53:08.199 align:start position:0%
at a three-year history of medic
 
01:53:10.270 --> 01:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
simplistically a three-year history of
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid claims and then there's a
 
01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
little bit more to it but basically it's
 
01:53:16.109 --> 01:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
proportionally divied out to the
 
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
counties and there's intergovernmental
 
01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
agreements between the department and
 
01:53:21.750 --> 01:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
each County um that go through GNC that
 
01:53:23.669 --> 01:53:23.679 align:start position:0%
are approved and we receive a monthly
 
01:53:26.310 --> 01:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
payment um from the
 
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
county so just my understanding it could
 
01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
the amounts county by county would be
 
01:53:34.350 --> 01:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
pretty ver this isn't a is a pretty
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
lumpy distribution it's on page two yeah
 
01:53:39.709 --> 01:53:39.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's on the second page um you'll
 
01:53:42.669 --> 01:53:42.679 align:start position:0%
see Hillsboro County uh really handles
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
the bulk of it um and it's significantly
 
01:53:46.910 --> 01:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
higher than you know Sullivan or or
 
01:53:49.310 --> 01:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
Grafton County or others and again
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
that's based on the actual Medicaid
 
01:53:52.629 --> 01:53:52.639 align:start position:0%
cleans over three-year period okay thank
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
you if I had looked at the asked the
 
01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
question thanks all right do do you have
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
concluding remarks associate
 
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner santanella now I just want
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
to say thank you um for your time um
 
01:54:07.870 --> 01:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
your flexibility and when I was able to
 
01:54:09.870 --> 01:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
present I hope you're feeling better I
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
feel a lot better thank you very much
 
01:54:13.470 --> 01:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
but I'm still glad you're beyond
 
01:54:16.030 --> 01:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
contagious disease yes I am not
 
01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
contagious right now good Mr White do
 
01:54:21.430 --> 01:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
you have any concluding remarks you'd
 
01:54:25.390 --> 01:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
like to make um no uh I I think um we
 
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
will have going back to the conversation
 
01:54:30.109 --> 01:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
that we had earlier around the the
 
01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
budget books and the presentations we
 
01:54:34.149 --> 01:54:34.159 align:start position:0%
will be bringing forward a three- ring
 
01:54:36.669 --> 01:54:36.679 align:start position:0%
binder um and what we'll be bringing at
 
01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
each presentation we'll be bringing the
 
01:54:40.109 --> 01:54:40.119 align:start position:0%
the presentation that has the accounting
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
unit strings the programmatic detail and
 
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
we'll also have the budget briefing
 
01:54:46.750 --> 01:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
books um which which again I if if you
 
01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
have a chance I encourage you to take a
 
01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
look at on the lb's website those are
 
01:54:51.990 --> 01:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
really a mountain of information for
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
each area and they try to get out all
 
01:54:56.069 --> 01:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
the details um that that we were talking
 
01:54:57.790 --> 01:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
about earlier for some of these programs
 
01:54:59.109 --> 01:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
so hopefully we can address that in
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
advance and if you do have any questions
 
01:55:03.310 --> 01:55:03.320 align:start position:0%
in advance please please send them along
 
01:55:05.149 --> 01:55:05.159 align:start position:0%
so we can prepare those before we get
 
01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
those uh before we get to the
 
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
presentations or if there's any
 
01:55:09.870 --> 01:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
particular topics that we haven't
 
01:55:11.069 --> 01:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
discussed that you kind of want to hear
 
01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
a little bit more about all right um
 
01:55:16.910 --> 01:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
from the committee are there any
 
01:55:21.149 --> 01:55:21.159 align:start position:0%
questions for the Department um in the
 
01:55:23.229 --> 01:55:23.239 align:start position:0%
audience is there is there any member of
 
01:55:27.069 --> 01:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
the public that wishes to say
 
01:55:31.149 --> 01:55:31.159 align:start position:0%
anything uh yes sir um why don't you sit
 
01:55:33.310 --> 01:55:33.320 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
01:55:36.149 --> 01:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
here and that way you can use that
 
01:55:38.310 --> 01:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
microphone and we'll just need to make
 
01:55:43.750 --> 01:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
record and the mic Goes On by hitting
 
01:55:49.189 --> 01:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
the button and it goes red there you go
 
01:55:52.709 --> 01:55:52.719 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much um members
 
01:55:55.149 --> 01:55:55.159 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Jeb cup I'm
 
01:55:58.390 --> 01:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
with life coping we're a case management
 
01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
agency um we cover the uh whole state of
 
01:56:04.830 --> 01:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we work on both the CFI or
 
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0%
choices for Independence waiver and also
 
01:56:10.709 --> 01:56:10.719 align:start position:0%
on the developmental disabilities waiver
 
01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
um acquired brain disorder and um inh
 
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
home support waiver so um this was
 
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
really a great presentation now we were
 
01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
particularly interested in Chris Sant
 
01:56:24.830 --> 01:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
Neo's presentation and really appreciate
 
01:56:26.910 --> 01:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
all of the the numbers and the hard work
 
01:56:29.629 --> 01:56:29.639 align:start position:0%
in this um one thing that has been
 
01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
discussed or earlier um was the the rate
 
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
the lack of rates and from the case
 
01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
management perspective when we look at
 
01:56:40.350 --> 01:56:40.360 align:start position:0%
um for instance the choices for
 
01:56:43.390 --> 01:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
Independence waiver um and other waivers
 
01:56:47.189 --> 01:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
um the rates in the U CFI waiver that we
 
01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
have um if you know what popped out at
 
01:56:53.109 --> 01:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
me was that when you look at the average
 
01:56:55.229 --> 01:56:55.239 align:start position:0%
cost I I realize all these are different
 
01:56:57.430 --> 01:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
populations they're all unique they all
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
have unique needs and we we have to of
 
01:57:04.270 --> 01:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
course take that into um utmost
 
01:57:07.629 --> 01:57:07.639 align:start position:0%
consideration um we've got with the CFI
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
waivers about
 
01:57:12.189 --> 01:57:12.199 align:start position:0%
$25,000 I think it's it's useful for the
 
01:57:13.629 --> 01:57:13.639 align:start position:0%
the committee to know that these
 
01:57:15.870 --> 01:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
individuals have a nursing home level of
 
01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:18.719 align:start position:0%
care so they are eligible to be in a
 
01:57:21.910 --> 01:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
nursing home um at significantly greater
 
01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:23.639 align:start position:0%
cost cost so that's about
 
01:57:26.950 --> 01:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
$75,000 so if you look at they're kept
 
01:57:28.669 --> 01:57:28.679 align:start position:0%
in the community um or they're
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
maintained or they're um participating
 
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
in the community at $225,000 a year so
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's really there's a
 
01:57:41.069 --> 01:57:41.079 align:start position:0%
$50,000 um actual um savings for the
 
01:57:43.550 --> 01:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
state and the federal government and the
 
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
counties by having these individuals in
 
01:57:49.669 --> 01:57:49.679 align:start position:0%
the um in the choices for Independence
 
01:57:52.669 --> 01:57:52.679 align:start position:0%
waiver um the
 
01:57:56.510 --> 01:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
one other thing that jumped out um and
 
01:57:58.709 --> 01:57:58.719 align:start position:0%
that was discussed and is is so
 
01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
important is the um establishment of of
 
01:58:05.709 --> 01:58:05.719 align:start position:0%
rates um we find or our case managers
 
01:58:08.910 --> 01:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
find it's very difficult without having
 
01:58:13.629 --> 01:58:13.639 align:start position:0%
standardized rates in our DD waiver um
 
01:58:19.229 --> 01:58:19.239 align:start position:0%
to um um basically predict anything as
 
01:58:24.350 --> 01:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
the um the um CFO for the for DHHS said
 
01:58:29.870 --> 01:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
um we have some clients in DD I have um
 
01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
we have one with life coping who has an
 
01:58:32.159 --> 01:58:33.510 align:start position:0%
we have one with life coping who has an
almost

01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
almost
 
01:58:37.589 --> 01:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
$700,000 a year budget so that's for 12
 
01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
months um it's $670,000
 
01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:43.990 align:start position:0%
months um it's $670,000
um

01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:47.990 --> 01:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
and um all those rates have to be just
 
01:58:52.270 --> 01:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
really just pounded out um by uh the
 
01:58:56.589 --> 01:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
case managers by the state um by um
 
01:58:59.149 --> 01:58:59.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes the um the DRC will get
 
01:59:02.830 --> 01:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
involved it's a very complicated process
 
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
and the um the benefit to all involved
 
01:59:09.470 --> 01:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
the state the federal government of
 
01:59:12.109 --> 01:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
course the the the participants in the
 
01:59:14.750 --> 01:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
program of having these standardized AES
 
01:59:16.910 --> 01:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
standardized rates would be would be
 
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
hugely important um I think in getting a
 
01:59:22.870 --> 01:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
handle on this and if you look at I I
 
01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
just went through and did some quick
 
01:59:28.390 --> 01:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
math um we've got about uh 5,900 people
 
01:59:31.950 --> 01:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
in DD waiver and if you multiply that by
 
01:59:35.790 --> 01:59:35.800 align:start position:0%
the the number here it's about $500
 
01:59:40.109 --> 01:59:40.119 align:start position:0%
million if if you look at the CFI waiver
 
01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
um you've got 3,900 individuals in there
 
01:59:44.950 --> 01:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
um at
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
$25,000 so it's it's just shy of a
 
01:59:51.310 --> 01:59:51.320 align:start position:0%
hundred million so you're talking and
 
01:59:54.430 --> 01:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
again we have to always remember each of
 
01:59:57.910 --> 01:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
these populations are are uniquely
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
different they have very different needs
 
02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
and but just by looking at numbers
 
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
you're seeing 5 to one in CFI we're
 
02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
seeing $100
 
02:00:14.069 --> 02:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
million um for 3,900 people now we got
 
02:00:18.350 --> 02:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
about 6,000 people in DD if if we were
 
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
going to compare apples to apples um and
 
02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
have 6,000 in CFI that's about a 50%
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
rough math increase so you're talking
 
02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
about $150 million to service 6,000
 
02:00:36.750 --> 02:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
people um where we've got um a half a
 
02:00:39.069 --> 02:00:39.079 align:start position:0%
billion dollar or a half a billion
 
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
dollars to now service um about 6,000
 
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
people under the DD waiver so I I just
 
02:00:52.069 --> 02:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
wanted to um to mention that and um
 
02:00:54.750 --> 02:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
thank um thank you all for the
 
02:00:55.950 --> 02:00:55.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
speak don't don't don't go away because
 
02:01:00.109 --> 02:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
I might if you'll let me I want to ask
 
02:01:04.149 --> 02:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
you a couple questions um but but first
 
02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
um when we're talking about rates I just
 
02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
want to keeping I I just want to know if
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about this right the rates
 
02:01:15.069 --> 02:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
that we want to adjust to I believe are
 
02:01:18.629 --> 02:01:18.639 align:start position:0%
the Alvarez and Marcel two rate system
 
02:01:21.229 --> 02:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
to and and we want to implement that
 
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
structured system system into what we're
 
02:01:27.229 --> 02:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
are no no so so so let's save that okay
 
02:01:29.189 --> 02:01:29.199 align:start position:0%
I just want if I were right I would have
 
02:01:31.950 --> 02:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
just kept going because but I'm not
 
02:01:33.629 --> 02:01:33.639 align:start position:0%
right so you need to educate me and
 
02:01:36.990 --> 02:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to take time um but I
 
02:01:41.350 --> 02:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
forget your name Jeb cop Jeb okay Jeff
 
02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for being willing to
 
02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
take a a question since you're out in
 
02:01:48.189 --> 02:01:48.199 align:start position:0%
the community one of the things I've
 
02:01:50.709 --> 02:01:50.719 align:start position:0%
I've I've wondered about and given that
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
we I I
 
02:01:55.350 --> 02:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
think you know any fool could wander in
 
02:01:57.790 --> 02:01:57.800 align:start position:0%
here and realize the CFI program is a
 
02:02:00.149 --> 02:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
great program and we should be doing the
 
02:02:03.149 --> 02:02:03.159 align:start position:0%
CFI as much as we possibly can the
 
02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
concern that I think we have in all of
 
02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
our our service provision is whether or
 
02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
not we have the capacity do are are you
 
02:02:14.750 --> 02:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
able with your Workforce issues able to
 
02:02:18.310 --> 02:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
scale your Your Capacity so you can
 
02:02:21.030 --> 02:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
support significantly more people in a
 
02:02:26.109 --> 02:02:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
environment yeah that's a great question
 
02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
um I think right now and I think some of
 
02:02:34.950 --> 02:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
there's another uh Granite case
 
02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
management is here as well they may want
 
02:02:39.390 --> 02:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
to speak to this um there's always a
 
02:02:42.189 --> 02:02:42.199 align:start position:0%
lack of providers um there always has
 
02:02:44.470 --> 02:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
been and and maybe there always will but
 
02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
it used to be much better um I know in
 
02:02:49.149 --> 02:02:49.159 align:start position:0%
the southern part of the State uh
 
02:02:52.350 --> 02:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
clients would have a uh a option of five
 
02:02:54.229 --> 02:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
different agencies to choose from for
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
their services um now that's no longer
 
02:02:58.870 --> 02:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
the case in the southern part of the
 
02:03:01.709 --> 02:03:01.719 align:start position:0%
state we're scrambling um to find
 
02:03:04.870 --> 02:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
service providers um the same way that
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
people are I think it's most acute in in
 
02:03:10.069 --> 02:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
the northern in Coos and Grafton
 
02:03:13.390 --> 02:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
counties um up in Berlin and the
 
02:03:16.870 --> 02:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
Northern parts of the state um but I I
 
02:03:18.510 --> 02:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
think you know it's another thing it's
 
02:03:19.870 --> 02:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's a question of supply and
 
02:03:22.589 --> 02:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
demand that's why the rate said is so
 
02:03:25.550 --> 02:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
important and how do you and it's always
 
02:03:27.750 --> 02:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
at some point the the demand is going to
 
02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
shift and increase as as the rates
 
02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
increased um and um so I I would say
 
02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
that that that whole part about um
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
having well we're speaking about CFI for
 
02:03:44.310 --> 02:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
CFI we've got to look at the rates all
 
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
the time because we're we're certainly
 
02:03:50.109 --> 02:03:50.119 align:start position:0%
not where we were um preco in terms of
 
02:03:52.229 --> 02:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
providers there's with got less
 
02:03:54.910 --> 02:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
providers than we had before Co and it
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
it things got really um pretty bad
 
02:04:01.069 --> 02:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
during Co but it's it has improved but
 
02:04:03.069 --> 02:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a question to answer
 
02:04:06.109 --> 02:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
your question if if we consistently look
 
02:04:08.790 --> 02:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
at the the the rate setting and the
 
02:04:11.549 --> 02:04:11.559 align:start position:0%
methodology for rate setting um will'll
 
02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
be able to manage that supply and demand
 
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
and put more people um who who would
 
02:04:19.629 --> 02:04:19.639 align:start position:0%
like to be into CFI and the CFI all
 
02:04:21.750 --> 02:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
right thank you did you have a comment I
 
02:04:25.109 --> 02:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
just um kind of to support what um Jeb
 
02:04:28.430 --> 02:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
um shared and thank you Jeb was um last
 
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
session when the legislature did
 
02:04:33.069 --> 02:04:33.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate funding for rate increases
 
02:04:35.629 --> 02:04:35.639 align:start position:0%
and I don't have the data in front of me
 
02:04:39.229 --> 02:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
but I do have it um we met with two um
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
CFI providers Waypoint and asentria and
 
02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
they shared with us the impact of those
 
02:04:48.390 --> 02:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
rate increases they were able to get
 
02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
staff who wanted to stay working there
 
02:04:54.549 --> 02:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
but left due to the wages come back to
 
02:04:56.910 --> 02:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
entria and Waypoint to work with
 
02:04:59.910 --> 02:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
individuals they were able to add I want
 
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
to say like 140 hours a month of
 
02:05:06.109 --> 02:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
services they were able to eliminate
 
02:05:08.709 --> 02:05:08.719 align:start position:0%
their weight lless so the rate increase
 
02:05:11.870 --> 02:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
does matter and how we went about it for
 
02:05:14.270 --> 02:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
the choices for Independence waiver and
 
02:05:16.830 --> 02:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
for um the developmental disability
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
waiver is starting at the cost of the
 
02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
direct support work what does it cost to
 
02:05:26.310 --> 02:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
recruit and retain and I do think that
 
02:05:29.470 --> 02:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
over time if we are able to have stable
 
02:05:33.510 --> 02:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
rates um it will enhance the ability of
 
02:05:36.510 --> 02:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
providers to serve these vulnerable
 
02:05:38.830 --> 02:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
populations I I saw a hand in the
 
02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:40.669 align:start position:0%
populations I I saw a hand in the
audience

02:05:40.669 --> 02:05:40.679 align:start position:0%
audience
 
02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:49.549 --> 02:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
u m Miss virtue Jeff if you if you want
 
02:05:51.350 --> 02:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
to sit there still you can we got lots
 
02:05:56.510 --> 02:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:02.910 --> 02:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:06.750 --> 02:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
virtue thank you for the introduction Mr
 
02:06:10.549 --> 02:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
chairman carollyn virtue Granite case
 
02:06:14.189 --> 02:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
management I would like to reiterate
 
02:06:19.229 --> 02:06:19.239 align:start position:0%
that the rate increases from last year
 
02:06:22.350 --> 02:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
have significantly
 
02:06:27.149 --> 02:06:27.159 align:start position:0%
impacted our ability to fill
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
authorized services in the care plans
 
02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
the providers that Miss sanon ELO
 
02:06:39.589 --> 02:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned are Personal Care Service
 
02:06:44.990 --> 02:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
Agency providers and um that
 
02:06:49.350 --> 02:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
information um is very good since I
 
02:06:52.629 --> 02:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to come up but since now up
 
02:06:55.910 --> 02:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
I did have one other thing that I wanted
 
02:07:01.069 --> 02:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
to mention um in the system of care
 
02:07:06.830 --> 02:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
language that was passed last year um
 
02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:07.870 align:start position:0%
language that was passed last year um
case

02:07:07.870 --> 02:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
management was
 
02:07:18.109 --> 02:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
specifically um mentioned as not to be
 
02:07:22.470 --> 02:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
um in the um
 
02:07:27.709 --> 02:07:27.719 align:start position:0%
CFI Navigator or provider groups and
 
02:07:31.790 --> 02:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
that wasn't made clear today and that is
 
02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:33.310 align:start position:0%
that wasn't made clear today and that is
important

02:07:33.310 --> 02:07:33.320 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:07:36.910 --> 02:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
because um the CFI case
 
02:07:41.430 --> 02:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
management is a state plan
 
02:07:47.669 --> 02:07:47.679 align:start position:0%
service so when that um rate is um being
 
02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
scored it should be scored against like
 
02:07:55.149 --> 02:07:55.159 align:start position:0%
services and to date it has not
 
02:07:57.870 --> 02:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
been that's it for me well you beat me
 
02:07:59.870 --> 02:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
because I I have almost no idea what
 
02:08:02.350 --> 02:08:02.360 align:start position:0%
you're talking about so so thank you for
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
that do do you have a comment on from
 
02:08:08.229 --> 02:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
the Department no I I think we're okay I
 
02:08:09.990 --> 02:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
think what Carolyn was just trying to
 
02:08:13.149 --> 02:08:13.159 align:start position:0%
show is in the developmental disability
 
02:08:15.870 --> 02:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
waivers those that Service Coordination
 
02:08:18.229 --> 02:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
is part of the waiver and for choices
 
02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
for independent it's an state plan
 
02:08:23.669 --> 02:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
