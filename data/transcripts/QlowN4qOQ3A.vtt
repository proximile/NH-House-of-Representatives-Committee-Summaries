00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
so it's a little past one it's division
 
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
two and we'll open the meeting with the
 
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
Department of education and please
 
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself my name is Mark Mello
 
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education Bureau
 
00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 align:start position:0%
of school Finance um uh today the focus
 
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
is adequacy um you have a couple of
 
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
documents in front of you uh you have
 
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
the orientation package that we provided
 
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
on January 13th if you already have this
 
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
I plan on just using this as a reference
 
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
if you want to discuss this today
 
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
because we had didn't cover all you know
 
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 align:start position:0%
33 pages in here um so if we want to
 
00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
refer back to it we can um if you
 
00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
already have a
 
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
you can just pass it off to Mickey and
 
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
and you know it'll just be around for
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
someone to pick up um the other document
 
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
here you already have this from the
 
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
January 13th training however I've
 
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
highlighted a few communities um and
 
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
we're just going to walk through this
 
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet because we did not do that
 
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
back in
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
January the new documents are we have
 
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
excess swep documents um so we're going
 
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
to dig in those dig into that a little
 
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
bit you have a handout a town by town of
 
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
the excess swept communities
 
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
and then you have a a sort of hyp
 
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
hypothetical walkthrough of what's going
 
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
to happen if excess swept becomes um the
 
00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
law of the land via the Rand the Rand
 
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
issue that's currently in the Supreme
 
00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
Court um and we'll talk about how that
 
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
would impact communities using these
 
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
tools um just to step back a little bit
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
before we talk about adequacy I think um
 
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
just spending some time in the education
 
00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
funding committee uh uh uh room seeing
 
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
some themes as far as what issues might
 
00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
make their way to D2 um seeing a lot of
 
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 align:start position:0%
swept bills so um going through swept
 
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
today I think is going to be helpful um
 
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
if you do have some swept bills that may
 
00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
get into this committee um other issues
 
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh we're seeing a lot of nutrition
 
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
program bills uh we're seeing EFA bills
 
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
we're seeing special education bills in
 
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
that committee um so you're going to
 
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
have a chance to learn um some of the
 
00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 align:start position:0%
new members or people not uh used to
 
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
digging into the details with education
 
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
funding um those are just some of the
 
00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
themes we're seeing in that committee so
 
00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
so um getting a baseline understanding
 
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh today and this week would be would be
 
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.909 align:start position:0%
uh today and this week would be would be
helpful

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
um so we're just going to walk through
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
the formula for three towns we have
 
00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:42.759 align:start position:0%
Albany Allenstown and
 
00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:44.749 align:start position:0%
Albany Allenstown and
Alton

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 align:start position:0%
Alton
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
um so Albany and Allenstown are pretty
 
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
similar they're not excess swept
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
communities um but we're just going to
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
walk through their data and then Alton
 
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
is an excess swept community and we're
 
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
going to be talking about that um so the
 
00:06:59.869 --> 00:06:59.879 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula as most of you know um
 
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
and if you've received this training um
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
the formula it does change every year
 
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
but a lot of it stays the same um so we
 
00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
have Albany Allenstown and Alton
 
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
highlighted there the First Column is
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
their membership um as we've discussed
 
00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
before as most of you know uh membership
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
is is the town responsible for educating
 
00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
that student so if Albany has students
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
that are receiving a home education and
 
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 align:start position:0%
are not to the responsibility of the
 
00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
district they're not part of their
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
membership if they have students going
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
to a non-public uh uh non-public school
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
school that the district's not paying
 
00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:32.879 align:start position:0%
for sometimes a district can pay to send
 
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
your kid to a student to a non-public
 
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
school um um whatever it may be if the
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
student is not part of the district
 
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
they're not part of the membership so
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's who are the students that Alban is
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
responsible for educating um and Albany
 
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't run any schools they actually
 
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
tuition students out however they are
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
responsible for educating those students
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
who live in that district and that's
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%
where we're measuring there is um
 
00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
average um average daily membership in
 
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
residents so they reside in Albany they
 
00:07:58.589 --> 00:07:58.599 align:start position:0%
reside in Allenstown they reside in
 
00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:00.230 align:start position:0%
reside in Allenstown they reside in
Alton

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
Alton
 
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
um alen's another example they send
 
00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
their students to Penbrook so their admr
 
00:08:06.149 --> 00:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
these 503 students are they what they're
 
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
responsible but they're sending students
 
00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:07.990 align:start position:0%
responsible but they're sending students
to

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:08:10.589 --> 00:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
Pembrook um um so that's the first
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
measurement and that's just how we
 
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
measure students uh for the adequacy
 
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
formula um you might explain how you get
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
an e of 81 8/10 of a student yes yes so
 
00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
that's the average daily membership part
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
um so we are looking at a student we're
 
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
looking at a student throughout the full
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
school year inadequacy one year is one
 
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
year behind so we would look at school
 
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
year 24 25 to uh for uh and we use that
 
00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:38.039 align:start position:0%
data for fiscal year 26 um but um it's
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
average daily membership and daily
 
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
membership so we're looking at a
 
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
student's full school year so full for
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
school year
 
00:08:48.509 --> 00:08:48.519 align:start position:0%
2425 um we estimate that there's going
 
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
to be 57.8 students and um that's just a
 
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
a matter of applying percentages and
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
coming up with an estimate but you can
 
00:08:58.509 --> 00:08:58.519 align:start position:0%
um have 57.8 students because if a
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
student was there for 4 fths of the year
 
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
they would be 08 of a student um and so
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is we have a data
 
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
collection from the school districts
 
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
they tell us um at the end of the year
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
they told us who was there at the first
 
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
day of school and who was there at the
 
00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:11.720 align:start position:0%
last day of school and if you're there
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
at the first day of school and the last
 
00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:14.519 align:start position:0%
day of school you're one student if you
 
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
were there for the first day it's 180
 
00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:20.079 align:start position:0%
days you were there for 90 days um and
 
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
you weren't there for the next 90 days
 
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
you're 05 student um so that's how we're
 
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
doing that measurement um whenever
 
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
you're trying to write education law
 
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
It's always important to remember how
 
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
you going to Define student um one of
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
the first things you have to decide is
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
are you going to be is it going to be a
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
snapshot count you going to say October
 
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
1st let's look at where these students
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
are which is data we do collect or you
 
00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:41.959 align:start position:0%
get to look at the full school year um
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
also when you're defining student you
 
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
want to think about what grade levels
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
ages all these other metrics as well um
 
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:47.720 align:start position:0%
but average daily membership or
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
enrollment um sometimes we use them
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
interchangeably but in the law you do
 
00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
need to be specific in how you use those
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
terms um so we're telling up all those
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
students um getting the average daily
 
00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
members and residence and then we're um
 
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519 align:start position:0%
uh multiplying it by something called
 
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
base adequacy Aid um so that is a metric
 
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
uh so one student is worth worth
 
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.230 align:start position:0%
uh so one student is worth worth
$426

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
$426
 
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
64 um you know for Albany we're going to
 
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
take 57.8 students and we're going to
 
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
multiply by the
 
00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:20.839 align:start position:0%
4,265 and we're going to get
 
00:10:20.839 --> 00:10:22.470 align:start position:0%
4,265 and we're going to get
$246,500

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
$246,500
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
um so that is base adequacy Aid um and
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
now if you're curious about the history
 
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
of Base adequacy a uh we had
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
representative Bean was discussing about
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh a little bit about the history uh
 
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
before before we started the committee
 
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
meeting um a lot of this history some of
 
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's legislative some of it happened in
 
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
this room uh a lot of it happened in
 
00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:46.839 align:start position:0%
this room uh uh but to understand some
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
of the rationale for this you'd have to
 
00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:51.079 align:start position:0%
read the 2008 committee report it was a
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
legislative report to study how they
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
would address adequacy and so there's a
 
00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:58.839 align:start position:0%
2008 report where they basically looked
 
00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:01.639 align:start position:0%
at teacher salaries they looked at what
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
they think would comprise an adequate
 
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
education and then they started
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
assigning cost to it and so they went
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
through that exercise of a thinking what
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
what do we think what what kind of
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
teachers do we want to have in a school
 
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
um what kind of PR principles guidance
 
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
counselors Etc and they come up with
 
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.310 align:start position:0%
counselors Etc and they come up with
this

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
methodology um uh uh and then they
 
00:11:23.069 --> 00:11:23.079 align:start position:0%
divided it by the number of students
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
they' expect those resources to educate
 
00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
and so they came up with a number this
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
was in 2008 they came up with a number
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
of I think it was like
 
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
$3,455 so that was a number they came
 
00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
back up with back then based on that
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
report of course if you uh um we've
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
discussed this but there's that number
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
this number this this $4,260 number and
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
as well as that 2 uh um 8 number of
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
3,455 or whatever it was exactly that is
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
being litigated so it was litigated in
 
00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
conal in
 
00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
2019 um it's still being litigated in
 
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
conal in essentially what the school
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
districts who have sued the state have
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
said that number doesn't provide
 
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.790 align:start position:0%
said that number doesn't provide
inadequate

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
inadequate
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
education and there's been uh uh
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
multiple Court hearings and and back and
 
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
forth to the Supreme Court back to the
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
Superior Court um but right now it's
 
00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
being litigated um and so the latest
 
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
order from a superior court not the
 
00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court is that that number should
 
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
be $
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
7,356 and that was a a trial that took
 
00:12:29.629 --> 00:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
place uh in the spring of uh uh the
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
spring of 2023 the order came out I
 
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
believe last fall um now it's in the
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court's hands so the Supreme
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
Court is now going decide is that number
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
that 700 uh 7,356 number is that number
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh whatever we don't know what
 
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to do um but they're going
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
to look at that number um so as far as
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
how's this came up with there was that
 
00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:54.279 align:start position:0%
2008 report that came up with a study
 
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
that came up with a number and then
 
00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
state law plugged that number right into
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
State Statute so that's how we got here
 
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
um and then there's a bunch of
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
litigation to follow um that's still
 
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
ongoing so that's that's sort of where
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
we're at with that number and and where
 
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
it exists um but um yeah you can
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
certainly study up on that
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
history um the next metric besides base
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid um and this goes back to
 
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
that 2008 report um when they were
 
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
studying adequacy and what it should be
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
um there's a couple factors that the
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
committee thought were important to uh
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh uh provide additional funding and in
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
that 2008 report um they referenced
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
poverty is something that requires extra
 
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
funding so they used free and reduced
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
price meals as the metric of poverty and
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
they decided to provide differential Aid
 
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
and extra money um for educating those
 
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
students they also looked at special
 
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
education English language learner um
 
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
there was also a third grade reading
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
component that's now gone uh so we don't
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
need to go down that rabbit hole but uh
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
um this is all back to that legislative
 
00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
history of 2008
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
um so what lives today now is we provide
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
additional aid for f&amp;r students um uh
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
which was also in that report but also
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
still in state law and in this formula
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
um so for those Albany students we are
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
going to look at those 57.8 students and
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
then we are going to um look at which
 
00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:20.519 align:start position:0%
students are uh free and reduced price
 
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
meal eligible and for each student that
 
00:14:24.189 --> 00:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
we can identify is free and reduced
 
00:14:25.389 --> 00:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
price meal eligible we're going to
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
multiply that by
 
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
$2,392 192 so that one Albany student
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
you're getting base a Aid you're also on
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
top of that getting free and reduced
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
price meals uh differential Aid so um
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
you know to take that 4200 plus the
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
2,300 that would be for one student that
 
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
one student that's fnr eligible um that
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
would be the aid for that at a student
 
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
level that's how you would measure that
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
Aid um so when we do that for Albany 77k
 
00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
for alltown 517k and for Alton
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
246k um the things with fre free and
 
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
reduced price meals um this committee's
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
received uh uh uh has talked about this
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
a lot is how do you identify those
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
students so there's two ways to identify
 
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
them there's the application so a family
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
fills out the application and if they're
 
00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:13.990 align:start position:0%
fills out the application and if they're
within

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
within
 
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
185% of the federal poverty guideline um
 
00:15:19.749 --> 00:15:19.759 align:start position:0%
they are marked eligible and they submit
 
00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
that sta to data to the department and
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
then we know that that student filled
 
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
out an application was determined
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
eligible um so there's filling out the
 
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
application the other way is direct
 
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.590 align:start position:0%
application the other way is direct
certification

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
so if you are um an individual who
 
00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:35.319 align:start position:0%
signed up for SNAP uh these are DHHS
 
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
entitlement programs snap or tanif a
 
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
program that does have a means test to
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
it um and you're determined eligible for
 
00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
that program uh we have data sharing
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's allowed um this is data sharing
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
is regulated by uh the federal
 
00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
government um uh but it's allowed that
 
00:15:54.749 --> 00:15:54.759 align:start position:0%
we can pass snap data and tanif data
 
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
from DHHS to the Department of Education
 
00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
and we can identify those students as
 
00:16:01.309 --> 00:16:01.319 align:start position:0%
directly certified through that program
 
00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:02.519 align:start position:0%
so if they did not fill out the
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
application we are still able to
 
00:16:05.949 --> 00:16:05.959 align:start position:0%
identify those students as fnr and
 
00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:07.399 align:start position:0%
that's called direct
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
certification um it can get a little
 
00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
complicated well a little there's a
 
00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
little wrinkle there as far as um if
 
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:15.949 align:start position:0%
little wrinkle there as far as um if
you're

00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
185% of the federal poverty guideline
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
you fill out the form but with SNAP
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
there's some a fiscal committee
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
established a policy two years ago that
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
you can be eligible for SNAP if you're
 
00:16:28.269 --> 00:16:28.279 align:start position:0%
200% of the federal poverty guideline so
 
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
if you're 200% % of the pedal Federal
 
00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
property guideline under snap um you can
 
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
directly certify um and still be
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
eligible as fnr under this program so
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
that's a um generally it's 185 unless
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
you're um uh 200% and on snap um then
 
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
you would be termined uh fnr
 
00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
eligible and the key thing to remember
 
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
about that is that money is not meant to
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
go to nutrition that money is
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
unrestricted money for your school so
 
00:16:58.269 --> 00:16:58.279 align:start position:0%
that uh you know 97.8 million Statewide
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
it's not restri restricted to to meals
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
it's not restricted to those students
 
00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:05.079 align:start position:0%
it's unrestricted money to go to uh uh
 
00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:06.839 align:start position:0%
to go to your school district it's
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
essentially targeting your school
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
district as having extra needs so you
 
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
get extra money but um uh it doesn't uh
 
00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go directly to uh a
 
00:17:16.029 --> 00:17:16.039 align:start position:0%
particular school with a high f&amp;r count
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
it's unrestricted for the
 
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
district um moving on to special
 
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
education Aid is differential Aid um
 
00:17:28.029 --> 00:17:28.039 align:start position:0%
same process if the student is uh uh in
 
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
our uh sped bu uh special education
 
00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:33.160 align:start position:0%
Bureau database as H having an IEP um we
 
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
are going to match that student with uh
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
um um with their base adequacy amount
 
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
and we're going to provide them
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
additional Aid of
 
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
$2,184 184 in special education Aid uh
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
so uh that multiplied by uh that amount
 
00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
uh gets us uh for Albany gets us
 
00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
36,42 for Allenstown uh 106 uh students
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
times that amount is
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
230k um and that's how uh special
 
00:18:06.029 --> 00:18:06.039 align:start position:0%
education differential Aid works again
 
00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
it's not restricted to uh those
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
students um English language learner um
 
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
same process if the student is an
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
English language learner which is a uh
 
00:18:18.669 --> 00:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
part of the title 3 Program of uh it's a
 
00:18:20.909 --> 00:18:20.919 align:start position:0%
federally regulated program um if the
 
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
student is an English language learner
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
we multiply those admrs um uh time those
 
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
amounts times those amounts right there
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
and we get um English language learner
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
Aid um and so we're telling this all up
 
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
to get the cost of inadequate education
 
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:37.240 align:start position:0%
cost of inadequate education it's that
 
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
base amount that fnr differential Aid
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
that special education differential Aid
 
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
English language learner differential
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
Aid I I'll there's some some hidden
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
columns here I'll say one more thing um
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
the recent law passed that now we always
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
pay home
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
education uh differential Aid
 
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
essentially which means if a student
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
it's not a lot of money it's about
 
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
$100,000 Statewide but if a student is
 
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
home educated so they have they're not
 
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the district they're not
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
going to get a degree from their
 
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
District because they're home educated
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
but they would like to take a course in
 
00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
their District they are entitled to do
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
that um and we will now collect class
 
00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
information on that student and will'll
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
basically convert that class information
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
that course information into an ADM and
 
00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:24.039 align:start position:0%
then compensate the school district so
 
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
um uh Statewide that's not a lot of
 
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
students it's a a few dozen students
 
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
that do that and so that's also part of
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
the formula it's just a tiny part of the
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
formula but we're telling up all those
 
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
students and we're getting the cost of
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
an adequate education and uh the way
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
that works is essentially we've
 
00:19:44.909 --> 00:19:44.919 align:start position:0%
determined you need this amount under
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
state law to provide an adequate
 
00:19:48.909 --> 00:19:48.919 align:start position:0%
education but before we pay that we're
 
00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:52.039 align:start position:0%
going to look at the swept and so what
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
the swept is essentially is the state
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
needs to raise $363
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
million um Statewide
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
and so we look at the the tax base the
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
entire state tax base without with
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
excluding utilities and it's about $300
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
billion and we go what is it what is it
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
what are we going to need to tax every
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
single uh Community 363 million over the
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
entire swept tax base and it turns out
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
to be a rate of about a11 12 per th000
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
and so when we apply that tax rate of A1
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
12 per th000 to all of these communities
 
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
it raises an amount and essentially it's
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
that's Community share of the swept
 
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:31.480 align:start position:0%
um there that Community share of the 363
 
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
million is the way to think about it and
 
00:20:36.909 --> 00:20:36.919 align:start position:0%
so for Albany their share of the 363
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
million or um that essential uh rate of
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
A1 12 it's an equalized rate um uh um we
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
can go into the Weeds about why you
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
don't pay A1 12 you pay something else
 
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
because you don't pay an equalized rate
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
you pay an actual tax rate um we don't
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
need to go in that right now but um uh
 
00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:57.799 align:start position:0%
um Alban share of that 363 million is
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
241 K so we look at the cost of
 
00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:03.799 align:start position:0%
inadequate education for Albany it's
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
360k uh um we need to pay uh we know
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
that they have swept of 241k going
 
00:21:11.149 --> 00:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
straight from their tax collector to
 
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
their uh uh local Treasurer and then to
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
their school district so we know the
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
Albany school district has 241k raised
 
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
from swept and so we're going to cut
 
00:21:24.029 --> 00:21:24.039 align:start position:0%
them a check for about 120,000 because
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
if we cut them a check for 120,000 which
 
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes we called ad adequacy grants
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
we call it adequacy I call it State cash
 
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
because it's literally cash from the
 
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
state to the district so if we cut them
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
a check for 120k plus we know they're
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
getting 241k from their swept we know
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
that they're going to have
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
360k in funding to provide an adequate
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
education as defined by the
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
state um same is true for Allenstown
 
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
Allenstown their swept revenue is
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
638k um but their cost of inadequate
 
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
education is 2.9 so now we need to cut
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
them a check of uh 2 .2 million is to
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
bring them up to the cost of an adequate
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
education um the one difference here is
 
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
when we talk about excess swept Alton is
 
00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
an excess swept community and so when we
 
00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
do the cost of inadequate education we
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
look at all the students in Alton and we
 
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
tally that up we get a cost of
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
inadequate education of 2.7 million when
 
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
we look at their swept it's 4.1 million
 
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:25.480 align:start position:0%
four really 4.2
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
million that swept all of that 4.2
 
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
million goes to Alton so it goes from
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
the Alton tax collector uh Alton tax
 
00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:34.279 align:start position:0%
collector collects it and then sends it
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
to the Alton School District
 
00:22:39.269 --> 00:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
um uh we don't need to cut a state check
 
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
for Alton because we know they're
 
00:22:42.669 --> 00:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
getting $4.2 million and we know that
 
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
$4.2 million covers the 2.7 million so
 
00:22:48.029 --> 00:22:48.039 align:start position:0%
they have uh anade enough to cover an
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
adequate education why it's called
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
excess swept is because it's above the
 
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
cost of an adequate education and so uh
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
there's litigation it's in the Supreme
 
00:23:00.669 --> 00:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
Court right now that's saying that Pol
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
State policy that Alton holds on to that
 
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
4.2 million and sends it to their school
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
district that um uh a superior court
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
judge ruled that that state policy is
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um uh uh certainly uh
 
00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
there's indiv certainly uh there's
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
litigation there's parties that disagree
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
you there's we're not we can't I think
 
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
it's not helpful to debate whether
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's the correct decision by the judge
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
or not um that is the Supreme right now
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
is in the Supreme Court hands um so the
 
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:27.400 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court's going to decide if that
 
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
is the correct policy of this
 
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the
 
00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
Constitution if they do say yes the
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
Superior Court ruled
 
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
correctly then at some point the Supreme
 
00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:40.919 align:start position:0%
Court would direct Dr to start
 
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
collecting that excess swept so they
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
would direct Dr in some way or some
 
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
fashion if this is the what the order
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
determines that um um that extra uh uh
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
let's see what 1 Point uh 1.5 million or
 
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
so I have it on this sheet yeah 1.4
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
million that extra 1.4 million now needs
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
to go to the state and that Al Alton is
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
not able to hold on to that again we
 
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
don't know what the order is going to be
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh it could come out right as you're
 
00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:11.799 align:start position:0%
finishing your budget who knows um it it
 
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's maybe might might come out during
 
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
the Senate phase who knows um but I want
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
you to be aware of that issue because it
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
might come out right as you're right as
 
00:24:21.789 --> 00:24:21.799 align:start position:0%
you're trying to wrap up your work um um
 
00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
and we're going to go into more details
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
about the uh how the mechanics of that
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
is going to work um
 
00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
if if it does happen representative Happ
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
and Phillips thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
you um for answering this question I'm
 
00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:35.559 align:start position:0%
not sure everybody on the committee
 
00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
knows the origin of the $363 million
 
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
Value First swept across the state could
 
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
you give us kind of like a synopsis of
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
where that value yeah I don't have the
 
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
whole history uh memorized but
 
00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
essentially um swept was enacted in the
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
90s late 90s um at one point it was a
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
rate so the rate was frozen and if
 
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
property values grew the revenue and the
 
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
rate was frozen and property values grew
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
the more money would come in um then I
 
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
believe at some point maybe it was the
 
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
mid 2000s they decided to freeze the
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
dollar amount so now if property values
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
grew and the dollar amount was frozen
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
then the rate would decrease so for the
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
past several years decades plus um the
 
00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
revenue has been frozen to 363 uh 36 uh
 
00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh three the property values have been
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
growing and the rate has been
 
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
decreasing um the history of that is I
 
00:25:29.789 --> 00:25:29.799 align:start position:0%
think around the time when they made
 
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
that change it was the rate was bringing
 
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
in 363 so I think they just froze it to
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
what it was currently funding um good
 
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
wer I think that was the money that was
 
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
the big energy producers like seab Brook
 
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
they had a lot of money so it was kind
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
of equalizing it by putting it all in
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
one thing and and letting the state tax
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
it um basically that was that was where
 
00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
the the amount came from but
 
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
if if they have
 
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
17 million or something excess in
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax what I
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
would ask Mr landrian is if he could
 
00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
look up and see what other Revenue they
 
00:26:17.789 --> 00:26:17.799 align:start position:0%
collect from the state let's say the
 
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
highway block grant Aid and the meals
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
and rooms tax and all these other things
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
that all the towns get a share
 
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
of and without adding a bunch of people
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
to the employment we already have the Dr
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
has a municipal group that goes around
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
and sets the tax rate in each town they
 
00:26:42.029 --> 00:26:42.039 align:start position:0%
could also say okay this 1.7 million
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
will become a
 
00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.430 align:start position:0%
will become a
credit

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
credit
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
against meals and rooms
 
00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
distribution uh Highway block grant or
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
whatever so that I would call it rather
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
than a Statewide property tax a
 
00:26:59.230 --> 00:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
Statewide balancing tax
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
so that we wouldn't hear the crying oh
 
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
you took this money away from our town
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
to give it to another town well it' be
 
00:27:09.389 --> 00:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
so complicated nobody'd be able to
 
00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:11.919 align:start position:0%
figure it out which is you don't want it
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
to be too simple because then they say
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
you took $9 million away from us or
 
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
whatever it was so that way well it it
 
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
varied we we gave you credit on this we
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
gave you credit on that but not
 
00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:24.919 align:start position:0%
everything cuz not only are we giving
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
out a billion dollars but we're also
 
00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
giving out another 20 million and all
 
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
these other taxes and this if we took
 
00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
all the excess in the Statewide
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
education property tax it might be what
 
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
9 million I think we've heard so yeah it
 
00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
would be easy enough to do credits by
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
the staff that comes around and sets the
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
tax rate and then it would all kind of
 
00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.350 align:start position:0%
tax rate and then it would all kind of
be

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
internal and maybe we wouldn't hear as
 
00:27:55.789 --> 00:27:55.799 align:start position:0%
much lawsuits and crying anyway yeah the
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Education has
 
00:27:59.950 --> 00:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
information as far as what Alton
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
receives and really it's um um or
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
Prospect mountain or um uh we have
 
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
information about uh District funding
 
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
but you're right as far as um the LBA
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
state aid database and Dr would have
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
more information about what the town
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
receives um but yeah we have we have
 
00:28:17.509 --> 00:28:17.519 align:start position:0%
some limited we have some information we
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
can provide relative to other state aid
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
um Alton would receive but but yeah
 
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
you'd have to um uh dig a little deeper
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
and Mickey could help out as far as is
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
that the biggest one or is it uh
 
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
Waterville Valley
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
well I've got this sheet right here the
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
um this is the state aid so we'll see
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
we'll see who's the biggest one
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
here uh rise up there uh mboro mboro is
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
the biggest um um mboro has U excess
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
swept of 4.9 million yeah um Ry looks
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
like it's number two with
 
00:28:53.509 --> 00:28:53.519 align:start position:0%
3.1 and then uh um a handful and so yeah
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
Statewide Statewide the total is 28.6
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
million um and this is
 
00:29:03.389 --> 00:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
so essentially if that order um
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
um we can we can dive into while we're
 
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
while we're in it let's dive into EXs
 
00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.710 align:start position:0%
while we're in it let's dive into EXs
swept

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
swept
 
00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
um um I think this is this is helpful
 
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
yeah that if if there weren't if there
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
were other taxes that or other
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
distribution from the state that this
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
could become a credit then it would it
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't affect even things out um so um
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
yeah that that that amount Statewide is
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
28.6 uh there's a lot of some of the
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
some of the people want to know um you
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
can look at your see if your Town's an
 
00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:42.039 align:start position:0%
excess swept Town representative Murray
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
oh sorry thank you Mr chair uh just for
 
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
clarification because perhaps I'm
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding what representative wer
 
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
is suggesting doesn't swept fund have to
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
be used for educational
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
purposes so there's uh I always want to
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
be careful because there's litigation
 
00:30:01.389 --> 00:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
going on about this um effectively that
 
00:30:03.509 --> 00:30:03.519 align:start position:0%
is what's happening for almost every
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
single Community um all of the large
 
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
communities on
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
here there is litigation where um uh if
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
the swept is so
 
00:30:21.149 --> 00:30:21.159 align:start position:0%
large that uh um it overfund it f more
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
than funds what you would even want to
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
spend on education then you get a
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
negative local tax rate and so that is
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
also being litigated whether that is
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
allowed um in this sheet right here
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
almost there's a couple of
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
unincorporated communities
 
00:30:37.149 --> 00:30:37.159 align:start position:0%
unincorporated communities have
 
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
generally negative tax rates um but um
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
the large EXs swept communities are
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
taking that excess weep dollars and
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
they're funding their school districts
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
with it um so that would be yeah any any
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
large community on there is they do not
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
have negative local tax rates um and
 
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
they're funding their education like you
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
said repres
 
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you Mr chair and again
 
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here I just wanted
 
00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
to add one more concern that hasn't been
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
expressed yet which is that if we start
 
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with excess swept where the
 
00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
municipality does need to send the money
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
back to the state that will create
 
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:17.919 align:start position:0%
significant cash flow issues in towns
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
because of the nature of the tax
 
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
collection process versus the
 
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
disbursement for the school district so
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
something like what chairman wer was
 
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.590 align:start position:0%
something like what chairman wer was
suggesting

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
I would say the major goal for that is
 
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the friction in the system
 
00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:34.919 align:start position:0%
in terms of a town potentially needing
 
00:31:36.669 --> 00:31:36.679 align:start position:0%
to take a short-term loan to send the
 
00:31:38.509 --> 00:31:38.519 align:start position:0%
money to the state only to get that
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
money from the state a month later all
 
00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:44.039 align:start position:0%
this movement of cash would be better if
 
00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
you know if we can find a way to
 
00:31:47.629 --> 00:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
decrease it it will just increase the
 
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
efficiency in the government so you know
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
those I've been the finance director in
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
wiam and my God a lot of my stress was
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
around meeting cash flow and this would
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
exacerbate cash flow issu is even for a
 
00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039 align:start position:0%
town like wiam it has nothing to do with
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
how much money we collect it's again the
 
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
timing of when the tax rates are set and
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
when the money go to the school
 
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
basically I have to pay the money to the
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
school at the new school budget six
 
00:32:12.909 --> 00:32:12.919 align:start position:0%
months before I start collecting at the
 
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
new tax rate so there are a lot of
 
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
intricate things in that that would
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
justify an approach which would decrease
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
the amount of money moving in two
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
directions you know at different points
 
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
in time thank you and and and just just
 
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
just to get into the weeds a little bit
 
00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:31.559 align:start position:0%
with cash flow
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
um uh towns and districts always have to
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
manage their cash flow of course and
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
really the town is in the driver's seat
 
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
um districts also have to manage their
 
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
cash flow as well of course um but the
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
town and districts are working together
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
on what is the dispersement schedule of
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
the money they're raising through taxes
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
which is the primary source uh um that
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
funds school districts and they're
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
sending it to the school
 
00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
district um and so that's in
 
00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:58.120 align:start position:0%
dispersements and I've I've seen exess
 
00:33:00.629 --> 00:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
web legislation that um you can either
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
do a lump sum um or you can do
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
dispersements um but cash flow is
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
definitely a consideration in in either
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
one of those uh
 
00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.789 align:start position:0%
one of those uh
scenarios

00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
scenarios
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
so want to go through this handout
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
um this one is just a hypothetical
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
walkthrough of how excess swept would
 
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
work if it was uh sorry if XS swept was
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
remitted to the state this is a
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
hypothetical walkthrough of how it would
 
00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
impact a
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
community so C under current law all
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
excess swept is retained so if we have
 
00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
under this hypothetical scenario say we
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
have a school budget of $2 million $1
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
million is local education property
 
00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
taxes $1 million is all swept and um
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
let's say they retain excess swept of
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
250k um so under current law it doesn't
 
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
matter if it's EXs or not EXs swept they
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
retain all of it so essentially there's
 
00:33:59.070 --> 00:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
a very simplistic model here but um $2
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
million budget half local funded half
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
state funded uh via
 
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
swept um what would happen if overnight
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
excess swept was remitted to the state
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
essentially and we controlled so they
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
did not change their budget in any way
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
kept their budget flat and what
 
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
if um uh no other Revenue Source came in
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
so again it's a very simplistic model
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
here but if they had a $2 million budget
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
and EXs swept had to be remitted to the
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
state um that community would continue
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
to pay the $1 million in swept that they
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
were paying all along the only
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
difference is is now they don't get to
 
00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:36.270 align:start position:0%
difference is is now they don't get to
keep

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
keep
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
250k and so um um that 250k now goes to
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
the state now if they want to continue
 
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
to fund their school at $2 million $2
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
million in a budget um their local
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
property taxes would have to increase by
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
250k so now if they took 250k out of
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
their budget that wouldn't be the case
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
um but that's the Assumption in this in
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
this sort of simple model we're holding
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
here um the reason why I'm mapping this
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
out is because it can get it is
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
true that the ex and and I've heard
 
00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
people talk about this multiple people
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
talk about this and it is true it is
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
true that you would be paying your EXs
 
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
weep to the state and then you would
 
00:35:16.589 --> 00:35:16.599 align:start position:0%
also have to Le raise Pro local property
 
00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
taxes at the same time to keep yeah so
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
that is true that you're doing two
 
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
things at once however it's important to
 
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
remember the actual Financial harm
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
you're receiving as an XS web Community
 
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
is only when the state decides you don't
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
get to keep your excess swept so you
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
feel the financial harm once even though
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
there's these multiple transactions
 
00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
taking place where you're paying the
 
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
state you're raising your local property
 
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
taxes but um when you see an analysis
 
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
and it's going to get tricky um as as
 
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
this as you dive into this issue and
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
receive more may potentially receive
 
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
some bills from Ed funding um it's going
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
to get complicated but um whenever
 
00:35:53.069 --> 00:35:53.079 align:start position:0%
you're seeing what is the excess
 
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
swept um um you might intuitively think
 
00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
I need to double that to measure my
 
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
financial harm but that's not what you
 
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
should be doing you should be looking at
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
um um you should be looking at the
 
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
excess swept and go okay if I'm an
 
00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:09.079 align:start position:0%
excess swept community and this becomes
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
the law via uh state law via uh uh court
 
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:15.400 align:start position:0%
order Etc um whatever is the excess
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
swept that is the financial harm um
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
again we're assuming controlling for a
 
00:36:20.829 --> 00:36:20.839 align:start position:0%
lot of variables here but that's the
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
correct measurement even though when you
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
walk through the situation it can get a
 
00:36:26.589 --> 00:36:26.599 align:start position:0%
little technical as far as um you first
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
you got to pay the state then you got to
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
pay your local school um so um anyways
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
that representative Murray thank you um
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
I'm can you expl I thought you said they
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
would this is something that only
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
experience once wouldn't it be once a
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
year yes yeah okay thank you yeah no no
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
no uh yeah yeah yeah yeah it would be it
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
would be once a year but um uh what what
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
talking this over and I think Mickey and
 
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:55.720 align:start position:0%
I were also scratching our heads because
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
we heard someone say you'd have to pay
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
it twice
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
and it's true that the transaction's
 
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
occurring in multiple different methods
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
but your financial harm is measured
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
once thank you again can I just you know
 
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
follow up so um one way of looking at
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
this um you know from I guess my
 
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
perspective where I where I live um
 
00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.190 align:start position:0%
perspective where I where I live um
you're

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
um asking school districts either to
 
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
raise their taxes or to reduce the level
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
of Education that they're providing
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
their students that would be that's the
 
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
effect of if you yeah you you Curr Curr
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
L pay your swept if you don't get to
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
keep all of it then the school
 
00:37:33.309 --> 00:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
district's taxes are going to go up or
 
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
if you reduce your budget then the taxes
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
uh local taxes would not go up so you're
 
00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.030 align:start position:0%
uh local taxes would not go up so you're
dis

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
dis
 
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
disincentivizing school districts from
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
maintaining their
 
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
education uh um yeah you're you're
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
there's Financial harm experienced um
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
and then there's only two ways to deal
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
with financial har well there's a couple
 
00:37:50.349 --> 00:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
different ways to deal with financial
 
00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
harm you find other Revenue uh or you
 
00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
cut your budget um and that's that's the
 
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
reality and that's true with with with
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
all the school funding aspects represent
 
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you I just wanted to
 
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
build on what my colleague was saying
 
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
and point out that for every dollar that
 
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
a donor town is harmed by there is a
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
receiver town that benefits so at the
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
state level whether we retain access web
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
or not is a zero sum game at the end of
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
the day all that money goes toward
 
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
educating kids somewhere but we are
 
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
essentially taking from communities and
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
giving to others the ones we take from
 
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
suffer Financial harm the ones we give
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
to suffer you know in injoy financial
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
benefits and again it's a zero sum game
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
game whether we redistribute swept or
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
not so just just to make sure we are all
 
00:38:46.109 --> 00:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
on the same page on this yes there is
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
concern for the towns that are harm but
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
that state policy should be balanced by
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
the fact other towns benefits so yeah
 
00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
all I can say about the Rand order is if
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
um there's uh this get more complicated
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
because you can talk about what are you
 
00:39:02.349 --> 00:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
going to do with the $28 million um the
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
Rand order just would say collect the
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
$28 million it wouldn't tell you how to
 
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.589 --> 00:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
um uh yes repr Kelly thank you how does
 
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
how does that affect a school district a
 
00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
multiple Town district oh uh like a
 
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
Cooperative yeah uh good question um so
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
um adequacy is cooperatives are unique
 
00:39:28.829 --> 00:39:28.839 align:start position:0%
um inadequacy and swept is somewhat
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
unique how it deals with um Cooperative
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
school districts so um a Cooperative
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
School District so I don't know if do
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
you have an
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
example karge we'll use karge as an
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
example is that seven towns yeah okay
 
00:39:44.829 --> 00:39:44.839 align:start position:0%
seven towns um so the way cure Sarge
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
works is essentially they have a budget
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
for the curge school district um cure
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
Serge is nice and simple it's not a
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
split District um John Stark can get uh
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
cork but um uh cure Serge seven towns
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
make up the uh seven Town School
 
00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
District so karge has a budget that
 
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:02.079 align:start position:0%
let's say that budget is $30
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
million um that's their Appropriations
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
that they would like to do to fund a
 
00:40:08.589 --> 00:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
cure Sarge School District then there's
 
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue that is shared among the seven
 
00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
towns so special education Aid title
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
funding lot of any tuition Revenue
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
coming in there's a bunch of Revenue
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
that they would share so essentially you
 
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
have $30 million let's say you've shared
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
revenue of $10 million so now they've
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
got that $30 million liability is now a
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
20 $ million liability because they've
 
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
all shared that $10 million then what
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
karge does um um is they a portion out
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
that $20 million liability between those
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
seven towns and I don't know if C are
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
just half EV half ADM whatever their
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
formula is they're going to share that
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
that $2 million liability among those
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
seven towns then before those seven
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
towns get a tax bill their adequacy and
 
00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
swept as shown up on this mun sheet is
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
going to directly credit their tax
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
liability so if um uh New London has a
 
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
really favorable formula they're going
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
to get all the financial benefits of
 
00:41:07.309 --> 00:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
having a favorable formula if um is it
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
Wilmont Wilmont doesn't they're not
 
00:41:11.309 --> 00:41:11.319 align:start position:0%
going to receive the financial benefits
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
so each municipality doesn't share their
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
adequacy Grant with their peers within
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
the Cooperative so you've got a $30
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
million budget let's say $10 million
 
00:41:22.109 --> 00:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
shared Revenue you apportion out based
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
on whatever the agreed upon
 
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
apportionment formula is and then you
 
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
credit the adequacy and swept grant for
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
each community so um that's how that
 
00:41:32.349 --> 00:41:32.359 align:start position:0%
works so whatever whatever your town is
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
that receives this grant essentially
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's your Grant it's not shared among
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
your peers but your title funding and
 
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
other funding is shared among your peers
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
swept okay
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
um so so we we stopped we stopped there
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
on where the swept is on the uh adequacy
 
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet um now we're going into the
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant so for the
 
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
form for Alton for EXs web communities
 
00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
the formula is essentially done um Alton
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
is is um uh but but we'll we'll keep
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
going for Albany and Allenstown so the
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
next part of the formula is the
 
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant so this grant
 
00:42:20.589 --> 00:42:20.599 align:start position:0%
is looking at the equalized valuation
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
per fnr pupil and so it's property over
 
00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
poverty essentially and it's becoming a
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
metric and so if you have a lot of
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
property in your numerator and not a lot
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
of poverty not a lot of fnr students in
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
your denominator um you would have a
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
really high number and so for Allenstown
 
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
even though Allenstown not Allenstown
 
00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
Alton has um a relatively High fnr
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
population looks like 20% so a little
 
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:46.559 align:start position:0%
bit below State average um they do have
 
00:42:48.549 --> 00:42:48.559 align:start position:0%
a lot of property so when we do the
 
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
property over poverty um the number is
 
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
36.4 million for
 
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
Alton but if you look at for Albany and
 
00:42:58.670 --> 00:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
Allenstown um it's much lower and so the
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
way this grant works is if your evf FRP
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
that metric property over poverty if
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
it's higher than 6.86 6 million you
 
00:43:11.069 --> 00:43:11.079 align:start position:0%
don't get the grant now if it's under
 
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
1.6 64 million um meaning you have
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
either low property or high poverty or
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
both or some sort of uh your relation
 
00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
between those two metrics is really low
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
produces a low number um which is true
 
00:43:26.349 --> 00:43:26.359 align:start position:0%
for Allenstown um um if that number is
 
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
under 1. .6 million you get an equalized
 
00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:31.720 align:start position:0%
valuation uh um you get an um
 
00:43:34.109 --> 00:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant of 11,500 for
 
00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
each fnr pupil um So currently under
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
this metric under this estimate no one
 
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
is entitled to that 11,500 per fnr pupil
 
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
um uh Berlin is close but they don't hit
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
it I think claremont's pretty close um
 
00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
Allenstown somewhat close as
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
well um um so instead you get a number
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
between 11,500 and zero depending on
 
00:43:59.950 --> 00:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
where you slide between 1.66 4 million
 
00:44:03.549 --> 00:44:03.559 align:start position:0%
and the 6.86 million of EV uh FRP
 
00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
measurement so for Albany um they barely
 
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
sort of squeak in um their evrp is 6.7
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
million uh so they're getting a really
 
00:44:16.589 --> 00:44:16.599 align:start position:0%
small Grant per each fnr student I don't
 
00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
know what the number is uh it's probably
 
00:44:20.589 --> 00:44:20.599 align:start position:0%
a few dollars um because they're really
 
00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
close to almost not being eligible
 
00:44:23.309 --> 00:44:23.319 align:start position:0%
because they're really close to that
 
00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
6866 Million number so um they're
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
granted their extraordinary needs Grant
 
00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.630 align:start position:0%
granted their extraordinary needs Grant
is

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
8,557 um well it's got to be more than a
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
few dollars it's got to be because it's
 
00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
produced 8,500 off 33 students but um um
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
they're close to they're close to not
 
00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:43.839 align:start position:0%
being eligible um Allenstown um is on
 
00:44:45.309 --> 00:44:45.319 align:start position:0%
the lower end so they're going to get a
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
larger Grant um so at that $2.6 million
 
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
um if you took that 1.9 and divided it
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
by 216 I can't do it in my head but you
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
would get what their extraordinary needs
 
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
Grant per pupil is
 
00:44:59.470 --> 00:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
um so they're going to get a higher
 
00:45:02.349 --> 00:45:02.359 align:start position:0%
amount than Albany and so that's the
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant it's targeted
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
for communities that have high po uh
 
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
High poverty and high low property um as
 
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
measured together as a ratio essentially
 
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
um this grant in fiscal year 26 the max
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
amount is now
 
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
11,500 um in fiscal year 25 it was
 
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:25.480 align:start position:0%
8,670 so in state law it got a boost uh
 
00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
uh so a lot of communities did see a big
 
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
boost in this number um uh under the
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant before I keep
 
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
going any extraordinary needs Grant
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
questions okay so that is targeted Aid
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh that keeps going so Alban and
 
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
Allenstown get it Al Alton does not
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
because they're over the
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
metric the next Grant is the hold
 
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
harmless Grant so the way fiscal year 20
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh6 works is whatever the hold harmless
 
00:45:58.109 --> 00:45:58.119 align:start position:0%
Grant in 25 was it's is going to be your
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
hold harmless Grant in 26 however it's
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
going to be 80% of
 
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
that so the way fiscal year 25 in way
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal 24 worked was essentially we ran
 
00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
the formula as you as you see it and if
 
00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:13.079 align:start position:0%
whatever we ran for the formula was less
 
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
than 104% of the fiscal year 24 estimate
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
that we made prior to the budget
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
changing you were guaranteed to receive
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
at least that much State cash really um
 
00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
so that's how the hold harmless worked
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
in 24 and 25 so a lot of communities if
 
00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
you look at your 24 25 grant if you're a
 
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
hold harmless Community you just
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
received the same money in 25 as you did
 
00:46:34.589 --> 00:46:34.599 align:start position:0%
in 24 um because you were basically held
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
harmless um even though the formula was
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
not working out in FA not working out in
 
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
your favor um um it was not working as
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
well as it did under the old formula
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
before major changes were made in fiscal
 
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
year 24 um it was not working out better
 
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
for you and the reason why you're a hold
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
harmless Community is likely because the
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
change in fiscal year 24
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
was base Aid was increased fnr
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
differential Aid was increased and the
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant was increased
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
dramatically um but at the same time
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
stabilization grants went away and
 
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
stabilization grants is a hold harmless
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
Grant from 2012 so back in 2011 they
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
were making changes to the formula for
 
00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
2012 and it was going to result in some
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
communities receiving less money in 2012
 
00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
than they did in 2011 and so what the
 
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
state decided to do was spend $158
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
million to sure that no Community
 
00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:31.559 align:start position:0%
received less money in 2012 than they
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
did in
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
2011 and that was called stabilization
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
grants there's a long history of
 
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
stabilization grants um they existed um
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
uh they existed untouched for um several
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
years until 2017 there was efforts to
 
00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
reduce them um then in 2020 they were
 
00:47:48.359 --> 00:47:49.230 align:start position:0%
reduce them um then in 2020 they were
fully

00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
fully
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
restored now in 20 in 2024 they were
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
taken away immediately taken away uh
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
completely but a lot of different other
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
boosts were given to the formula um so
 
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
when you factor in all the other boost
 
00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
in the formula um uh uh that helped out
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of communities some communities
 
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
were not fully made hold by the loss and
 
00:48:11.309 --> 00:48:11.319 align:start position:0%
stabilization so essentially the new
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
stabilization which we called hold
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
harmless is now $59
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
million so
 
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
158 any questions about hold harmless y
 
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
repres papich thank you I just wanted to
 
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
state that it's not cheaper overall it's
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
cheaper as that sole element of the
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
formula because at the end of the day we
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
pumped money in a bunch of different
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
other parts of the formula and overall
 
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
last budget cycle we increased overall
 
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
education spending by 193 million with
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
population you know student population
 
00:48:50.789 --> 00:48:50.799 align:start position:0%
dropping so absolutely agreed that one
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
element of the formula was
 
00:48:57.069 --> 00:48:57.079 align:start position:0%
reduced fortunately but there were
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
plenty of others that um made it a very
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
positive gain overall that that's
 
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
correct above and beyond existing state
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
aid went up substantially during that
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
same year in which the hold harmless was
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
was put into effect um it is very common
 
00:49:13.549 --> 00:49:13.559 align:start position:0%
hold harmless is um they exist obviously
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire other state formulas
 
00:49:17.069 --> 00:49:17.079 align:start position:0%
use hold harmless it's a very common
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
Tool uh of course it's it's no one likes
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
to have their funding reduced so um uh
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
hold harmless hold armless is are you
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
see them in other states as well uh uh
 
00:49:29.549 --> 00:49:29.559 align:start position:0%
usually a policy objective is to keep it
 
00:49:32.349 --> 00:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
as low as possible so that's that's uh
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
um something people aim for so uh um
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
yeah whenever you see a hold harmless
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's sometimes it's it's considered is
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
the formula working or not um a way to
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
think about it represent of H Phelps
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm just wondering
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
Mark um can you remind me how long the
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
tail is for the hold harmless grants
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
good question um so um yeah the hold
 
00:49:56.789 --> 00:49:56.799 align:start position:0%
harmless is now uh sort of set in stone
 
00:49:59.150 --> 00:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
and determined in 25 this fiscal year
 
00:50:01.549 --> 00:50:01.559 align:start position:0%
right now um the data is going to shift
 
00:50:02.829 --> 00:50:02.839 align:start position:0%
a little bit well we've been talking
 
00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
with some school districts tinkering
 
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
with the data just a tiny bit a student
 
00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
here or there um uh but once we finalize
 
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 25 adequacy which will
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
be the April 1 payment um that's now the
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
hold harmless grant that is Frozen um
 
00:50:17.309 --> 00:50:17.319 align:start position:0%
right now we estimated to be 59 million
 
00:50:20.109 --> 00:50:20.119 align:start position:0%
it's going to stay around that amount um
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
then in fiscal year 26 we're reducing it
 
00:50:24.789 --> 00:50:24.799 align:start position:0%
by 20% in FIS so it's 80 going to be 80%
 
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
of that 25 number fiscal year 27 it's
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
going to be 80% of that number then in
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 28 it's going to be 60% and
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
so it's going to reduce essentially it
 
00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
last for 10 years so uh um every two
 
00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
years there's a 20% reduction so it's
 
00:50:41.309 --> 00:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
going to last uh uh the first reduction
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
is in fiscal year 26 and after we finish
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
the 10-year period the hold harmless
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
Grant will be
 
00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
zero so last it will slowly decrease
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
over that period by 20% each uh every
 
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.950 align:start position:0%
over that period by 20% each uh every
other

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:53.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:50:58.789 --> 00:50:58.799 align:start position:0%
year and uh uh um so we've been NH has
 
00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
been going out and talking to
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
communities and letting them know that
 
00:51:02.109 --> 00:51:02.119 align:start position:0%
they have a hold harmless Grant and
 
00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
letting them know that it's going to go
 
00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
away um so that they can prepare for
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
that um that's the that's the end of the
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
formula so essentially you do cost of in
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
adequate education back out swept that
 
00:51:16.829 --> 00:51:16.839 align:start position:0%
gets you we call the preliminary Grant
 
00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes that gets you an amount um add
 
00:51:20.589 --> 00:51:20.599 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant ads hold
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
harmless Grant um uh if you're eligible
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
for that that gets you your adequacy
 
00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:27.640 align:start position:0%
Grant so that's that second to last
 
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
column is the adequacy grant it's
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
essentially the state cash from the
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
state um but then when we talk about
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
school funding we combined adequacy and
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
swept so that's the last column so
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
that's that billion doll 80 million it's
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
all state cash and it's all
 
00:51:46.589 --> 00:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
swept so that's it for adequacy um
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
excess swept conversations we also have
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
the packet is there anything
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
else to discuss relative to school
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
got a brilliant group I guess we'll just
 
00:52:06.789 --> 00:52:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
right oh yeah um I'll just quickly go
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
through the packet um kayin recommended
 
00:52:13.119 --> 00:52:18.789 align:start position:0%
through the packet um kayin recommended
this

00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
um there's actually a a few kind of neat
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
things uh kind a few kind of neat things
 
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
I want to show you in here so um the
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
first one is the fiscal year 25 26 27
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
forecast can you just mention page
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
you're you're in the ucation funding
 
00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:35.240 align:start position:0%
orientation correct yes funding
 
00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
orientation could just mention page
 
00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:39.799 align:start position:0%
numbers as you go yep um so page two is
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
basically the education trust fund um
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
estimates uh currently um for what we
 
00:52:48.789 --> 00:52:48.799 align:start position:0%
think you're going to be working with um
 
00:52:51.549 --> 00:52:51.559 align:start position:0%
uh uh U these are numbers numbers to of
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
course on February uh February 15th
 
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to receive a you're going
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
to receive the budget from the governor
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
um so you have different numbers to work
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
with potentially depending on uh um um
 
00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
depending what the what the governor
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
presents um but these are these are
 
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
estimates for fiscal year 25 26
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
27 um for the education trust fund and
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
the programs and we're going to be
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
talking about um the the biggest program
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
of course is District adequacy um uh
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about charter
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
schools in a second
 
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
efas EA phas out um multiple other
 
00:53:24.589 --> 00:53:24.599 align:start position:0%
programs that are funded by the
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
and the building Aid there just be clear
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
is detail what you show for 26 and
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
27 uh for sorry what was the question bu
 
00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
um the building Aid you show in 26 and
 
00:53:38.309 --> 00:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
27 just represents the tail correct this
 
00:53:40.109 --> 00:53:40.119 align:start position:0%
this this this number right here assumes
 
00:53:41.829 --> 00:53:41.839 align:start position:0%
no new building Aid projects and that's
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
just the tail liability that you'd have
 
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
to pay does everybody understand that
 
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
want to understand that no why don't you
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
oh oh okay right never mind uh and the
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
tail almost is going away so it's it's
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
getting close it's been going on for a
 
00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
while so I'm getting close to the it's
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
getting smaller each year
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
um uh uh yeah you talk about building
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
Aid later uh page three this is a pie
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
chart um you don't have the official act
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
for out the annual comprehensive
 
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
financial report um this is just a pie
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
chart of the education trust fund
 
00:54:21.069 --> 00:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
Revenue it's un audited uh fiscal year
 
00:54:21.079 --> 00:54:22.950 align:start position:0%
Revenue it's un audited uh fiscal year
24

00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
24
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
um uh for you to sort of just see that
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh business profits tax it was pretty
 
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
interesting I looked at this
 
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
historically business Enterprise tax
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
used to be a much larger uh piece of the
 
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
pie I think it was like 11% of just a
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
few years ago um so now uh uh um uh
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
business profits tax is a larger piece
 
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
of the pie um Statewide education
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
property tax is a piece of the pie and
 
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
that's um the mechanics of swept is it's
 
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
a it's a journal entury so the way to
 
00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:53.720 align:start position:0%
see it the way you're seeing it on the
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
Aur and in the state financials is
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
although um no money left a district
 
00:55:02.349 --> 00:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
under current law no money left a
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
district and was sent to the state we
 
00:55:08.349 --> 00:55:08.359 align:start position:0%
know um that that money was assessed by
 
00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers uh uh assessed against
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and we know that District sent
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
we know that town Town Tax Collectors
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
sent it to their school district so the
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
state is recording on our books is a
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
journal entry that 363 363 million was
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
raised so we'll book that as Revenue
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
even though no cash came into our bank
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
and then we booked $363 million went out
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
from the state and so sometimes it can
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
get a little confusing when you're
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
reading a fiscal note what what's going
 
00:55:35.029 --> 00:55:35.039 align:start position:0%
on with the swep it's basically
 
00:55:39.029 --> 00:55:39.039 align:start position:0%
accounting it's just a journal entry um
 
00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
obviously if if the Rand order comes out
 
00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:43.720 align:start position:0%
whatever may happen if EXs weep becomes
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
the policy of the state going to change
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
things a little bit that uh uh but still
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
there's going to be still going to be
 
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
just a a journal ENT uh for the most
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
part um I always get this uh you might
 
00:55:57.789 --> 00:55:57.799 align:start position:0%
get this from from your voters um they
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
always talk about Lottery um I get the
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
question all the time hey doesn't didn't
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
Lottery solve school funding didn't
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
bring in all the so Lottery Lottery
 
00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:07.240 align:start position:0%
lottery does great for us uh 177% of the
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
education trust fund it's really
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
performing super well with 200 million
 
00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
uh but you know sometimes you'll talk to
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
someone and they they think it funds the
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
full billion it does not um um and then
 
00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
there's other some some other Revenue
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
sources that come into the education
 
00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.829 align:start position:0%
sources that come into the education
trust

00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
trust
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
fund um this documents page page four
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's a little cut off at the bottom this
 
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
document's already pretty outdated this
 
00:56:33.069 --> 00:56:33.079 align:start position:0%
is just an LBA Surplus statement um
 
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the month of March Mickey is
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
going to be running a lot of these for
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
you um and just keep keeping you uh
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
keeping tabs of the education trust fund
 
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
um uh and you'll get Revenue numbers um
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
coming out monthly that are going to
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
change the Dynamics of this um if the
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
revenue numbers uh don't hit um so that
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
is an education trust fund Surplus
 
00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
statement hang on second
 
00:56:58.349 --> 00:56:58.359 align:start position:0%
mark so like Mark said this document
 
00:57:00.029 --> 00:57:00.039 align:start position:0%
will end up looking pretty familiar to
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
you as we work through this session
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
we'll have one like this for also the
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
highway fund and the fishing game fund
 
00:57:06.789 --> 00:57:06.799 align:start position:0%
it's a surplus statement we call it so
 
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:08.559 align:start position:0%
this is a good big picture of the
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
education trust fund especially for the
 
00:57:11.789 --> 00:57:11.799 align:start position:0%
new members you can see all the revenue
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
up top all the programs that are funded
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
on down below so we will get those
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates from house Ways and
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
Means at some point hopefully within the
 
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
next month um if not hopefully on the
 
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
sooner end and then all the
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
Appropriations down below those are up
 
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
to this committee to determine how much
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
you want to fund each program at uh what
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
level you could some of the attorney
 
00:57:33.789 --> 00:57:33.799 align:start position:0%
members will recall it the education
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
trust fund never used to be this
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
widespread for the number of programs it
 
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
covers it used to Simply Be adequacy
 
00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:41.720 align:start position:0%
charter school adequacy and the low and
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
moderate um income tax relief program at
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
Dr it's been expanded quite a bit
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
because there was a lot of resources in
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund but all of this
 
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:53.480 align:start position:0%
is the uh prerogative of this committee
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
how you want to fund all these moving
 
00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
forward in your budget package so I just
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure everyone understood
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
this is an important document you'll see
 
00:58:02.589 --> 00:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
reoccurring in this committee for the
 
00:58:05.069 --> 00:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
next several
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
weeks does that make sense
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
everybody um this as a result of what
 
00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate did it didn't have all these
 
00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
things listed when it left us two years
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
ago two years if you recall the the
 
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
house passed budget I don't want to
 
00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
misspeak I think it it it took out a ton
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
of the programs and put put them on the
 
00:58:28.589 --> 00:58:28.599 align:start position:0%
general funds and switch some of the
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
allocations of the uh business tax
 
00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
revenue to be mostly in the general fund
 
00:58:34.029 --> 00:58:34.039 align:start position:0%
the Senate did unwind those changes in
 
00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
its proposed budget um and that
 
00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
ultimately is what ended up passing so
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
that that is uh correct what
 
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:45.640 align:start position:0%
described um yeah that's so that's the
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement um page five is
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
basically the one pager on adequacy you
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
just you you just got that
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
presentation um page six through um the
 
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
few next Pages um it shows you um fiscal
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
year 25 compared to fiscal year 26 I've
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
been sharing this information with the
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
districts because I want districts to
 
00:59:09.789 --> 00:59:09.799 align:start position:0%
know if their funding is their if their
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
funding is decreasing and it's likely
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
caused to the hold harmless going away I
 
00:59:14.829 --> 00:59:14.839 align:start position:0%
wanted them to be aware um so they can
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
prepare for that um but the way you'll
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
always rece going forward um the way
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
you'll always receive analysis is it's
 
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
always going to be what is current law
 
00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:25.559 align:start position:0%
so mean you do nothing and then what is
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
the proposed policy so you'll be seeing
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
that in fiscal notes you've already been
 
00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:30.200 align:start position:0%
seeing that in fiscal notes but any
 
00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
analysis moving forward that's the
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
standard at which we do analysis on this
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
um this is just unique analysis so don't
 
00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
expect to receive this analysis moving
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
forward you'll always see proposed
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
law um page 12 uh is the adequacy
 
00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
history document um it's got some of the
 
00:59:58.270 --> 00:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
ch ches throughout the years um adequacy
 
01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
had changed pretty much for five
 
01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:03.160 align:start position:0%
straight years it changed every year um
 
01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal year 25 almost no change
 
01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
except for that home education piece um
 
01:00:08.349 --> 01:00:08.359 align:start position:0%
but I'm not going to count it I'm going
 
01:00:11.789 --> 01:00:11.799 align:start position:0%
to count it as a year without change um
 
01:00:14.829 --> 01:00:14.839 align:start position:0%
uh uh I'll guess I'll get into the I
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
don't know if I want to get into the
 
01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
weeds with this but uh um you can change
 
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
adequacy anytime you want via state law
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
however if you ever change the districts
 
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
are right now working on their 26 budget
 
01:00:28.349 --> 01:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
so if you change adequacy they're not
 
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
going to be able to adapt their budgets
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
um in any way to it they have processes
 
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
in place to do special district meetings
 
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
however um um if you change adequacy
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
every single year it's going to it's
 
01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
just a revenue change for the district
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
um just something to be mindful of
 
01:00:47.069 --> 01:00:47.079 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh previous committees have
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
decided to always change it in the the
 
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
year give them one year to adjust to it
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
um um you can you you under State law
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
can change it whenever you want
 
01:00:58.510 --> 01:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh but that's just something to to think
 
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
about representative wer the problem
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
with what the Senate did putting all
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
these things into adequacy was that we
 
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
ended up with 129 million in Surplus
 
01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:11.240 align:start position:0%
education trust fund that couldn't be
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
used anywhere else in the second year
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
when there were other things that we
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
would have liked to have funded but the
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
error of the Senate and putting all this
 
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
stuff and and adequacy meant that
 
01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
everything was tied up in education
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
trust funds so I don't think we want to
 
01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
again um page 13 is just a breakdown of
 
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 and 20 2020 and this is
 
01:01:39.309 --> 01:01:39.319 align:start position:0%
um uh you can look at the expenditure
 
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
side of it um to see um where there's
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
growth and expenditures are where the
 
01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
expenditures are taking place um we're
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
using 2020 as sort of the pre-co year um
 
01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:49.960 align:start position:0%
um even though the last couple months
 
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
were Co impacted uh fiscal year 24
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
obviously the current the latest data we
 
01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:57.160 align:start position:0%
have um only thing pointing out is
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of federal money that went
 
01:02:00.029 --> 01:02:00.039 align:start position:0%
out to school districts that money is in
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
the process of expiring but you'll see
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
that in the data um all the additional
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
Federal money has increased expenditures
 
01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:07.799 align:start position:0%
for school districts because they
 
01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
received the money spending the money um
 
01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:12.839 align:start position:0%
is there a reason new Founders excluded
 
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
um they did not provide a financial
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
report uh it's a long story but okay
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
they had
 
01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
yeah um hopefully we'll get that we'll
 
01:02:23.789 --> 01:02:23.799 align:start position:0%
get that soon
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
um page 14
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
24 uh page 15 is um cost per pupil this
 
01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:37.839 align:start position:0%
is something we publish on our website
 
01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
you hear talked about a lot um important
 
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
to know that cost per pupil it's current
 
01:02:45.269 --> 01:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
expenditures so it doesn't include debt
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
Ser uh Debt Service doesn't include
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
Capital expenditures it's current
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
operating expenditures there are some
 
01:02:52.029 --> 01:02:52.039 align:start position:0%
other exclusions in there um and it's
 
01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:53.720 align:start position:0%
over the students being educated in that
 
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
school so Albany does not educate any
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
students so they don't have a cost per
 
01:02:59.829 --> 01:02:59.839 align:start position:0%
pupil because this is meant to measure
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
the cost of educating a student at a
 
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
school that you're operating and Albany
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't operate a school um so cost per
 
01:03:10.349 --> 01:03:10.359 align:start position:0%
people just a common common data point
 
01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
or metric you'll see in the in the area
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
space um page 19 is equalize valuation
 
01:03:20.559 --> 01:03:21.990 align:start position:0%
space um page 19 is equalize valuation
over

01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
admr um if you ever hear the term Fiscal
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
Capac capacity to disparity Aid instead
 
01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
of looking at property values over um
 
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
fnr students uh um fysal capacity
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid is a Formula an a concept
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
that has existed in the state for a
 
01:03:41.309 --> 01:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
while now and when um um gets discussed
 
01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
a lot and that's the concept of not
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
focusing on fnr students but focusing on
 
01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
all property over all students um and so
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's measured as equalized valuation
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
per pupil and so um you might hear that
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
um well The house's The house's passed
 
01:03:57.269 --> 01:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
bills recently that the Senate um uh did
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
concept all right page page 26 is my my
 
01:04:11.309 --> 01:04:11.319 align:start position:0%
favorite data
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
point a lot of you uh like to look at
 
01:04:16.109 --> 01:04:16.119 align:start position:0%
your tax rate and you have a lot of
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
feelings about your tax rate um wherever
 
01:04:19.309 --> 01:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
they may be but you always and then you
 
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
want to look at your neighbor's tax rate
 
01:04:23.269 --> 01:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
and so you can't do that accurately you
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
can't look at your tax rate and your
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
neighbor's neighbor meaning um uh a
 
01:04:28.589 --> 01:04:28.599 align:start position:0%
neighboring town and say oh man that
 
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
Town's got it that Town's got it so nice
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
they might have it nice but you you you
 
01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
don't want to look at the tax rate that
 
01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
they pay because that is based on the
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
assessed valuation and you don't know
 
01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
how that Town's assessing practice is so
 
01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
you want to look at an equalized tax
 
01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
rate so this controls that if you had
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
one town that was assessing every year
 
01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
it would make it look like the property
 
01:04:51.269 --> 01:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
well the properties would be keeping up
 
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
with market value and therefore the tax
 
01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
rate would be pretty low um but if you
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
had a town that was really slow to
 
01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
assess and they weren't assessing that
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
often um but costs were going up um the
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
tax rate would look really high and so
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
you would think that Community is paying
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
more than you but really they're just
 
01:05:08.829 --> 01:05:08.839 align:start position:0%
not assessing as often so the tax rate
 
01:05:10.829 --> 01:05:10.839 align:start position:0%
looks really high because they're slow
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
to assess and then one Community the tax
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
rate may think you have a really low tax
 
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
rate but really you're just assessing so
 
01:05:18.589 --> 01:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
much and so the only way to control or
 
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
the best way to control for that is to
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
look at an equalized tax rate and so
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
this provides a more apples to apples
 
01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
comparison there's so much that goes
 
01:05:29.269 --> 01:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
into taxes Revenue expenditures but when
 
01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
you can control for assessing practices
 
01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
you can actually see you know if you're
 
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
getting a good deal to to some extent um
 
01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
really you're only controlling for
 
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
assessing practices but that's the way
 
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
to that's the way to analyze um uh your
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
tax rate and compared to your peers um
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:54.839 align:start position:0%
rate okay we're moving along here uh
 
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
page 32 is just um uh enrollment
 
01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
participation by um uh all the different
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
entities that exist so we have
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
non-public enrollment um we talked about
 
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
it head orientation um the home
 
01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
Education data is not super reliable um
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
uh the district Public School data it
 
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
comes in we have something called a sid
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
that is basically it's like a student
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
social security number essentially it's
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
a unique number that comes in for each
 
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
student so um we have data controls on
 
01:06:23.710 --> 01:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
the student data that's coming in to
 
01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
make sure they're not duplicating a
 
01:06:25.319 --> 01:06:26.269 align:start position:0%
make sure they're not duplicating a
student

01:06:26.269 --> 01:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh because they have this unique
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
identifier um we have data controls for
 
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools we have data controls
 
01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:33.640 align:start position:0%
for U EFA students the sasset is the
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
data control um the other aspects are
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
surveys and so they're less controlled
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
data collections um it's the data we
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
have so it's the data you kind of have
 
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
to use because there's no other data
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
that I can provide you um but um um this
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
is where you can look at basically where
 
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
the students are being educated um with
 
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
most most of the students being in the
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
district system so
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
there seems to be quite a jumping around
 
01:07:01.549 --> 01:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
like from 15 16 then drops down
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
dramatically and then starts to spike
 
01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
back up again it can you especially the
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
1516 and 16117 is there a reason for
 
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
that I'm look at the total number down
 
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
there 6 6,000 down to 2700 yeah so um
 
01:07:16.829 --> 01:07:16.839 align:start position:0%
the way thato students reported to the
 
01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Education changed so um
 
01:07:22.269 --> 01:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
home schoolers used have to register
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
since I've been I wasn't there I wasn't
 
01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
working time but all homeschoolers used
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
to have to register with the state or
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
their local District annually so there
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
was more reporting requirements and the
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
N was Chang so students only need to
 
01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
register in their lifetime so we could
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
stop reporting stop collecting that
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
information the department that chose to
 
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
at least collect from the schools the
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
number of new registrants every year so
 
01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
the number that we're reporting right
 
01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
now is actually the number of new
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
registers for getting every year rather
 
01:07:53.309 --> 01:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
than the number of children that are
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
annually access schools
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
okay so these numbers only represent new
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
people coming in at that to our knowled
 
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
so like Mark said use the data with a
 
01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
grain of assault because there are still
 
01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
many parents that register every single
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
year and the district might not know
 
01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:13.799 align:start position:0%
that also if a district child to move
 
01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
around there's ambiguity whether they
 
01:08:18.030 --> 01:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
need to register each district they live
 
01:08:20.189 --> 01:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
in they might register once in their
 
01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
educational career they might be
 
01:08:23.070 --> 01:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
registering every year there's still
 
01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
probably some confusion with um
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
students receiving EFA whether they need
 
01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
to register with their discri or not so
 
01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
we do know that at times students have
 
01:08:34.749 --> 01:08:34.759 align:start position:0%
tried to register with their District
 
01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
even though that's not required if
 
01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:36.829 align:start position:0%
even though that's not required if
you're

01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
accram and because we don't have any
 
01:08:41.070 --> 01:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
unque student data as Mark just
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned we can't really do any
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
reconciliation on that thank you in in a
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
concept in education um it's it's it's
 
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat intuitive kids need to go to
 
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
school um uh or kids need to get an
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
education um the way just an area that
 
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's helpful to think about this is It's
 
01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
called the compulsory attendance law and
 
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
so students need to be in an educational
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
system once they turn six so they need
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
to either be in their District school a
 
01:09:08.309 --> 01:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
public charter school a non-public
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
school an home education program or an
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
EFA program so those are all the
 
01:09:13.709 --> 01:09:13.719 align:start position:0%
different ways in which a student can
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
receive an education that's compliant
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
with state law in New Hampshire um and
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
so uh some of those students are home
 
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
educated non-public
 
01:09:26.669 --> 01:09:26.679 align:start position:0%
Etc um
 
01:09:29.149 --> 01:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
lastly uh this is just Federal funding
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
on page 33 and
 
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
that's that's uh allocations out there
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh these are kind of our standard
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
allocations so they don't include all
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
the additional covid money um that's um
 
01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
the state has been spending over the
 
01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
past few years um it was allocated out
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
you know multiple years ago um that is
 
01:09:49.709 --> 01:09:49.719 align:start position:0%
federal funding that's the packet
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
so any questions representative muray
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you again uh just so I'm really
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
clear on the part of the packet that has
 
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
you know 300 Pages uh the were um so so
 
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
I say page 30 pick you know pick any of
 
01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
them the towns that are listed in the I
 
01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
guess the fourth column from the left
 
01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
those are the towns that are included in
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
the Cooperative District right and so a
 
01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
place like Ry sends their students to
 
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth for high school that's cont
 
01:10:21.149 --> 01:10:21.159 align:start position:0%
that's treated as tuition yes thank you
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
just yep and weal yeah there's a lot of
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
different ways to structure your school
 
01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
you can can be a standalone School
 
01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
District that doesn't operate a school
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
or you can be um um yeah you can be a
 
01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:34.280 align:start position:0%
town that's part of a Cooperative um
 
01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
yeah multiple multiple different
 
01:10:36.669 --> 01:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
complexities we can get into that if
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
we'd like to but um maybe save it for
 
01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.709 align:start position:0%
we'd like to but um maybe save it for
another

01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:43.640 align:start position:0%
day all right thank you so before you go
 
01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
so just this that that Federal
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
page it's about 140 million dollar a
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
year roughly that would be getting this
 
01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
year in federal aid is that what how to
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
read that yep um yes um with the biggest
 
01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
one being um uh uh the title programs
 
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
which is up top um that's our largest
 
01:11:05.790 --> 01:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
largest funding source and then idea
 
01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
which is the special education grants to
 
01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
schools um that's the second largest or
 
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
that's actually is the largest um
 
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
funding source in the federal
 
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
funding thank you so that's what the
 
01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
grants the states there under subtotal
 
01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
idea um yep yep special education grants
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:57.950 align:start position:0%
 
what

01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:59.790 --> 01:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
welcome do you want me to take you
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
through those Federal programs real
 
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
quick and tell you what each one does
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
sure which since we're here um just back
 
01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
to that packet what page was that one on
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
last page it's the last page
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
33 this may be inform useful information
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
going forward so um because there's
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
obviously a lot of conversations about
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen with the federal
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
money and whatnot so the the bulk of the
 
01:12:25.229 --> 01:12:25.239 align:start position:0%
federal money that's coming into
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire are these
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
programs right here um these sorry both
 
01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
of the K12 education funding um there's
 
01:12:32.629 --> 01:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
plenty of higher edit funding and other
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
funding um but so on the first line um
 
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
that you have you have title one so
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
everybody knows the term title one but
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
it's helping uh educationally
 
01:12:43.149 --> 01:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
disadvantage students so typically
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
students um in poverty the is a Formula
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
that's in federal law that provides
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
additional funds based on your free and
 
01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch percentages and your total
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
overall enrollments but it's heavily
 
01:12:55.629 --> 01:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
weighted on
 
01:12:57.629 --> 01:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
um title or your free and reduced lunch
 
01:12:59.550 --> 01:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
percentages there's also some set as
 
01:13:02.110 --> 01:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
sides in that for low performing schools
 
01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
so the bottom five% of schools are known
 
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
as CSI schools comprehensive support and
 
01:13:08.629 --> 01:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
Improvement schools um and so there's a
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
set aside in that that goes to those
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
schools um migrant is exactly what it
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
looks like it's um funding that is
 
01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
provided to provide educational supports
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
for migrant students in the state
 
01:13:23.550 --> 01:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
neglected and delinquent is students
 
01:13:25.629 --> 01:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
there is funding that helps students in
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
um like group homes in New Hampshire
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
there's also a set aside in title one
 
01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
that supports those kids too um
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
supporting infe effective instructional
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
state grants that's known as title back
 
01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
to the migrant line who gets included
 
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
there um so students that are considered
 
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
migrant students in the state and the
 
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
definition I think is you have to be
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
working on agricultural programs um and
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
these are typically students that are
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
working on farms we see a lot of them um
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
or their parents are working on farms
 
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
like at apple orchards and whatnot in
 
01:13:59.910 --> 01:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
the fall and so they're more transient
 
01:14:01.950 --> 01:14:01.960 align:start position:0%
population and I believe these funds can
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
be used providing uh to tutoring
 
01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
Services directly to the students where
 
01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
they are living and do you track them by
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
year in terms of numbers we do yes and
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
can we get that information um we can
 
01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:19.990 align:start position:0%
can we get that information um we can
yes

01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
thanks um so the next one is supporting
 
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
effective instruction so that's known as
 
01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
title 2A that's a term that we all call
 
01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
it it's essentially professional
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
development funding for school that are
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
used to support teachers in schools it
 
01:14:33.709 --> 01:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
can be used um for some class size
 
01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
reduction as well but the majority of it
 
01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
is instructional support or professional
 
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
development 21st Century Learning
 
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
Centers is before in after school
 
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
programs again um it's heavily weighted
 
01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
on free and reduced lunch numbers um
 
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
State assessments is um exactly um what
 
01:14:53.709 --> 01:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
we um what it sounds like it provides
 
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
supports for the state assessment
 
01:14:57.149 --> 01:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
required under
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
Esa Rural and low-income schools is uh
 
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
funding that is dispersed to rural or
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
low income schools around the state it
 
01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
is um very flexible as far as the
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
supports but you can see there's not a
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
ton of money so it doesn't go very far
 
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
um same with the rural School
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
achievement program that's is known as
 
01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
reap that actually weirdly doesn't flow
 
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
through the Department of Education I
 
01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
guess one of these the things I should
 
01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
explain is the majority of this funding
 
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
that you see right here is Flowing
 
01:15:25.629 --> 01:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
directly from the US Department of
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
Education to the New Hampshire
 
01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Education the New
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education then
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
calculates what each district is
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
entitled to based on a formula that's in
 
01:15:37.629 --> 01:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
federal law and then disperses those
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
funds we go ahead we have a pretty
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Grant management system
 
01:15:44.669 --> 01:15:44.679 align:start position:0%
and process that we're required to
 
01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
follow including monthly drawdowns of
 
01:15:49.149 --> 01:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
funding we review to make sure that
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
activities that schools are spending the
 
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
funding on are allowable under these
 
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
different grants and then we have um a
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
lot of liance requirements around these
 
01:15:58.750 --> 01:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
grants so just to make sure I understand
 
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
this because I was going through some of
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
these um
 
01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
rsas if you look at the State Board of
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
Education rsas they make reference to
 
01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that that's where the federal
 
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
all the federal funding flows into some
 
01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
account is that the same thing as you're
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
saying the Department of Education or is
 
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
it really another something else going
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
on so one of my other bills I've been
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
very passionate about over the years is
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
Rec codifying the education laws um
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
because there are a lot of areas where
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
um the thing like Commissioner of
 
01:16:30.910 --> 01:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
education and Department of Education or
 
01:16:32.189 --> 01:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and State Board
 
01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
of Education are used
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
interchangeably um and there's
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
definitely a lack of clarity and this
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
that's one of those things so um these
 
01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
all of these grants right here with
 
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
exception of the reef one the rural
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
School achievement program all has a
 
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
separate accounting unit in the
 
01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
department of education budget and
 
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
you're seeing those funds and those will
 
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
be part of our bigger overall budget so
 
01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
when you see that we have I think it's
 
01:16:56.669 --> 01:16:56.679 align:start position:0%
like two or three 00 million of federal
 
01:16:58.750 --> 01:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
funding in the department budget that
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
includes these these monies as well have
 
01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:03.320 align:start position:0%
you made any progress on
 
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
the I know a couple years ago we looked
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
at try to do the whole thing and and
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
that was just like out of control have
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
you made your progress of little bits
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
and pieces we might like plug in here
 
01:17:12.669 --> 01:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
and there so I mean we are always
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
working on different pieces um where we
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
tried to rewrite say the accountability
 
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
law last year we got some push back on
 
01:17:22.110 --> 01:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
that um we have some other pieces of
 
01:17:24.510 --> 01:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
data on like the data comprehensive
 
01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:26.440 align:start position:0%
piece that we should do those are not to
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
be done in a budget year we don't have
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
the time to do that in a budget year
 
01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
there is um a bill once again to allow
 
01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
the department to do that I think with
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
division 2 we had actually come up with
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
a really good plan which was require the
 
01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
department to release an RFP come to
 
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal with the results of those RSP
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
that RFP and then fiscal could decide if
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
they wanted to fund that unfortunately
 
01:17:49.149 --> 01:17:49.159 align:start position:0%
that's ultimately not what got passed
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
and there was some other there was
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
another bill that got killed in in the
 
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
Senate and um so it it's uh so just let
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
it go yeah well no we should still do it
 
01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's very important because there's
 
01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions like that you like
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
that that you just asked that really do
 
01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
need to be clarified um I mean and
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
there's just other sections of law you
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
know when we're talking about the
 
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
student um identifier for example um
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
there's a section of law that
 
01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
establishes our um system that we use
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
for that and then other information that
 
01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
can be attach that and it's spread
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
throughout all of those education laws
 
01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
and it really needs to be put in one
 
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
place so we really have a comprehensive
 
01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
understanding that can be what can be
 
01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
done with that so and it does require
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
the legisl it's not something you can do
 
01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
in rules in most cases uh no it's for
 
01:18:32.629 --> 01:18:32.639 align:start position:0%
sure the law um the rules would need to
 
01:18:35.790 --> 01:18:35.800 align:start position:0%
be updated after but it is the the law
 
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
is just so maybe next year we can at
 
01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
least get a little piece of it instead
 
01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
of trying to shoot for the moon yeah I I
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
think that would be um a great thing to
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
so yes Susan representative D Roy sorry
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not so familiar with the grants for
 
01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
schools does it all go through you or
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
can the individual schools go for
 
01:18:56.629 --> 01:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
federal grants as well um so there are
 
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes federal grants that the
 
01:19:00.510 --> 01:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
federal agency May release that would go
 
01:19:02.350 --> 01:19:02.360 align:start position:0%
uh that they could apply to directly but
 
01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
these funds all go through us and
 
01:19:06.270 --> 01:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
they're required to so we're known as a
 
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
flow through agency or an sea a State
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
Education Agency and in the law that
 
01:19:13.629 --> 01:19:13.639 align:start position:0%
establishes many of these so the ones
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about right now are
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
the every all established in the every
 
01:19:18.510 --> 01:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
student six leads law it requires the
 
01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
funding to go to the Sea us and then us
 
01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
to distribute the money to an Lea the
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
local Education Agency
 
01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
so if they go directly to the federal
 
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
agencies for Grants the the individual
 
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
schools do they report that to you if
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
they go outside of this program and
 
01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
there's a grant out there so it would be
 
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
reported on the doe2 if it's a federal
 
01:19:38.990 --> 01:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
expenditure because they're required to
 
01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
report all expenditures at the school
 
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
district level so um another example of
 
01:19:46.669 --> 01:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
a grant um so the department of energy
 
01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
recently had grants for school districts
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
for Energy Efficiency projects and that
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't go through us but if a school
 
01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
district were making those expenditures
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
they would need to be reported on the
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
doe 25 to us so when we're looking at
 
01:19:59.870 --> 01:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
the total spending when you're looking
 
01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
at local state and other spending all
 
01:20:04.030 --> 01:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
federal funding and all local spending
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of who's giving it to the
 
01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
doe2 um all right so so small rural
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
education achievement program again so
 
01:20:18.149 --> 01:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
that's that goes directly to the schools
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
student academic supports and enrichment
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
grants that's known as title 4B um that
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
is really used for Technology support at
 
01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
schools um English language acquisition
 
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
that's uh known as title three those are
 
01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:33.560 align:start position:0%
for um students that um have limited
 
01:20:35.950 --> 01:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
English language proficiency um and that
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
those funds go to support school
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
districts providing services to those
 
01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
children homeless children and youth it
 
01:20:44.669 --> 01:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
is exactly what it sounds like it's to
 
01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:46.719 align:start position:0%
provide school um support to school
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
districts that have homeless
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
children um and then so those are the
 
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
esa that every student succeeds act um
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
Grant grants those were previously known
 
01:20:57.870 --> 01:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
as No Child Left Behind when it was
 
01:20:59.390 --> 01:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
reauthorized it was that every student
 
01:21:02.189 --> 01:21:02.199 align:start position:0%
succeeds act um it is the part of the
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
larger Elementary and secondary
 
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
Education Act um which was the original
 
01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
Education Act which one was that you
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
were so all all of the ones I just um
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
talked about oh okay thank you so
 
01:21:15.149 --> 01:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
starting toing so then the next thing so
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
you have the individuals with disability
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
and Education Act that's known as it
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
idea um or special education and so
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
there's three grants um totaling about
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
60 1 million that New Hampshire is
 
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
entitled to um you have the largest
 
01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
Grant the $56 million Grant and the
 
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
preschool Grant the 1.7 those flow
 
01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
through the Department of Education the
 
01:21:37.149 --> 01:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
grants for infants and families actually
 
01:21:40.030 --> 01:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
go through HHS here in New Hampshire
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
just kind of to kind of delineate that
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
which does the grants for infants and
 
01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:48.040 align:start position:0%
families thank you but the rest of that
 
01:21:49.229 --> 01:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
goes through the dep Department of
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
Education um and then career and Tech
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
education grants or otherwise known as
 
01:21:56.669 --> 01:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
the Carl D Perkins Grant and those are
 
01:21:58.510 --> 01:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
to provide funding to school districts
 
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
that have a career and a tech education
 
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
program those are the large federal
 
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
grants that are flowing through us there
 
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
are other grants that we receive at the
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Education um those usually
 
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
are federal discretionary grants that we
 
01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:13.639 align:start position:0%
may apply for directly to the US
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education the one that I
 
01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:17.800 align:start position:0%
can think of most recently or not most
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
most recently but one we were successful
 
01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
in receiving um we received the charter
 
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
school Grant the $46 million Charter
 
01:22:24.910 --> 01:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
School grant that was a discretionary
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
grant that the Department of Education
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
applied for we were actually required to
 
01:22:30.750 --> 01:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
apply for it in state law but there was
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
no requirement for us to apply for it in
 
01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
federal law so we applied it and we're
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
success applied for it and were
 
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
successful we've also applied for two
 
01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
slds student longitudinal Data Systems
 
01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
grants and those are just supplemental F
 
01:22:45.189 --> 01:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
funds that help us uh improve our
 
01:22:46.990 --> 01:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
education reporting
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
systems so all those you just rattled
 
01:22:52.229 --> 01:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
off come under the Career and Technical
 
01:22:53.629 --> 01:22:53.639 align:start position:0%
no no no no those are completely
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
separate they just so these are the ones
 
01:22:57.149 --> 01:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Education
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
typically gets on a very regular basis
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
that are um because of Federal Acts that
 
01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
um allocate funding to the state those
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
this is out of a federal budget this is
 
01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
not out of the Department of Education
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
Bud budget so when you're looking at the
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
department of education budget as a
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
whole you'll see those other grants but
 
01:23:16.030 --> 01:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
this right here is just for the purpose
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
of talking about the formula grants that
 
01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:21.719 align:start position:0%
so one of the the things that you know
 
01:23:23.070 --> 01:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about lately in the
 
01:23:24.510 --> 01:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
news is when you're talking about
 
01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
formula grants to States um or or sorry
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
block grants to States instead of
 
01:23:31.229 --> 01:23:31.239 align:start position:0%
formula grants these are likely the ones
 
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
that would become block grants rather
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
than formula grants so the Career and
 
01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
Technical education say grants does that
 
01:23:38.669 --> 01:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
have any relationship to
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
ccsnh um I do actually believe there's a
 
01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
set aside that goes to ccsnh um Melissa
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
white will be here on Wednesday and can
 
01:23:50.110 --> 01:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
um can you actually write that down um
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh we'll be able to clarify that for you
 
01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
but I think there is a small set aside
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
that's supposed to help um tech ed
 
01:23:57.669 --> 01:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
programs okay and what would the rest of
 
01:24:00.189 --> 01:24:00.199 align:start position:0%
it be going toward um public schools
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
that have a career in Tech education
 
01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
center so like here in conquered we have
 
01:24:05.950 --> 01:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
the conquered Regional Tech so we have
 
01:24:08.350 --> 01:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have Regional career
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
and Tech Education Centers we have our
 
01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:12.280 align:start position:0%
regional model so high school level high
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
school level yes yeah K through 12 um
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
which the state as a whole um determined
 
01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
was the best way of having career and
 
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
Tech education in the 70s um and so that
 
01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
helps um have higher quality programs
 
01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
reduces duplication and provides um or
 
01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
increases Statewide um availability to
 
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
students that may live in a more rural
 
01:24:35.229 --> 01:24:35.239 align:start position:0%
community who that Community itself
 
01:24:37.709 --> 01:24:37.719 align:start position:0%
couldn't necessarily support a career
 
01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
and Tech education program so because we
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
have this Regional tuitional tuition
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
model it helps um increase access um so
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about that we have so the
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
federal funding is specifically to
 
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
support the programs and then we have
 
01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:52.280 align:start position:0%
state funding too called Career and
 
01:24:54.629 --> 01:24:54.639 align:start position:0%
teched tuition and transportation which
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
helps those school districts that are
 
01:24:58.070 --> 01:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
sending those kids to a district that's
 
01:25:01.229 --> 01:25:01.239 align:start position:0%
not theirs um with supports for the the
 
01:25:02.910 --> 01:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
transportation costs and the tuition
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
costs of those KS thank you and I would
 
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
see that in the budget yes you'll see
 
01:25:07.590 --> 01:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
that in the budget thank
 
01:25:11.229 --> 01:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
you so I just wanted that was just a
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
kind of brief overview of those federal
 
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
funds I know we're getting a lot of
 
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
questions about those
 
01:25:17.950 --> 01:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
so um so next up we're going to talk
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
about charter schools and Brian Eaton is
 
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
going to take over and talk about
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
charter school funding thank you good
 
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh my name is Brian and I also
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
work in The Bu of school Finance um so
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
this is a quick packet packet this won't
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
go uh too long this is just to provide
 
01:25:34.270 --> 01:25:34.280 align:start position:0%
some insight to how Charters are funded
 
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
this is specifically state aid so kayen
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
just mentioned there's a charter Grant
 
01:25:39.709 --> 01:25:39.719 align:start position:0%
that's a Federal grant for startup of
 
01:25:41.229 --> 01:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
Charters this is what we're talking
 
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
about is strictly just state aid similar
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
to what we talked about earlier with
 
01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:46.350 align:start position:0%
to what we talked about earlier with
Mark

01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:46.360 align:start position:0%
Mark
 
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
adequacy so page two might look familiar
 
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
so it is a what we call one pager on
 
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
Charter Public School funding and so the
 
01:25:56.669 --> 01:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
the majority of these rates will look
 
01:25:58.109 --> 01:25:58.119 align:start position:0%
familiar because these are the rates
 
01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
that are followed for district adequacy
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
those adequacy rates Mark just mentioned
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
before there slight variations we'll go
 
01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
through and describe those so it's very
 
01:26:08.350 --> 01:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
top bar uh top row there that is the
 
01:26:10.189 --> 01:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
base adequacy aid for all students based
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
on ADM calculation throughout the whole
 
01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
year that is 4 $
 
01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:16.229 align:start position:0%
year that is 4 $
4,265

01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
4,265
 
01:26:18.910 --> 01:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
64 and another thing to uh another
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
different differentiation between this
 
01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
and adequacy is that this is paid the
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
year the student isn't so with adequacy
 
01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
there's one year lag um Charter Aid is
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
paid the year so we're in fisc year 25
 
01:26:32.669 --> 01:26:32.679 align:start position:0%
also school year 25 those students are
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
paid throughout the year in iterations
 
01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
through four payments they are the
 
01:26:37.709 --> 01:26:37.719 align:start position:0%
charters are paid the same year the
 
01:26:37.719 --> 01:26:39.350 align:start position:0%
charters are paid the same year the
students

01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:26:41.950 --> 01:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
attend next row would be fnr again we
 
01:26:43.109 --> 01:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
talked about that those are students
 
01:26:44.910 --> 01:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
eligible for free and reduced lunch
 
01:26:47.070 --> 01:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
price meals and that is the same rate as
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
you would see in
 
01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
adequacy next row is special education
 
01:26:53.550 --> 01:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
same rate the difference is also with
 
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
special education is that it is paid to
 
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
the district of responsibility so the
 
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
amount of um Aid that would be for us
 
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
Char of school for uh for example
 
01:27:05.709 --> 01:27:05.719 align:start position:0%
students that are identified as special
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
education attend that Charter School the
 
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
aid is actually going to the town those
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
students reside in and then the town or
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
district school district would work with
 
01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
the charter school on um anou or tuition
 
01:27:17.229 --> 01:27:17.239 align:start position:0%
agreement in order to actually uh work
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
through if the child's receiving those
 
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:20.719 align:start position:0%
Services there they might not be so
 
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
that's something that the uh Charter
 
01:27:23.950 --> 01:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
School in the district or town would
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
work work together with to coordinate
 
01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
those services and that is uh in law
 
01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
because the town responsibility is
 
01:27:32.430 --> 01:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for U for coordinating those
 
01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
Services uh responsible for those
 
01:27:35.310 --> 01:27:35.320 align:start position:0%
Services special
 
01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
education next row would be English
 
01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
language learner again similar to
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
District adequacy that is uh the rate
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
also in District adequacy and each one
 
01:27:45.109 --> 01:27:45.119 align:start position:0%
of those we mentioned earlier increasing
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
2% each year uh through current
 
01:27:51.669 --> 01:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
law so that break that breaks down each
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
Aid component for a charter Aid there's
 
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
one additional which is called the
 
01:27:57.990 --> 01:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
additional Grant um and so it is
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
different between VX which is the uh
 
01:28:01.950 --> 01:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
virtual Learning Academy Charter School
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
and non-vx so for all intented purposes
 
01:28:07.229 --> 01:28:07.239 align:start position:0%
that can be sort of tacked on to the
 
01:28:09.390 --> 01:28:09.400 align:start position:0%
base Aid it's an additional Grant rate
 
01:28:10.669 --> 01:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
for every student that attends that
 
01:28:12.669 --> 01:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
charter school so on the bottom left
 
01:28:14.709 --> 01:28:14.719 align:start position:0%
you'll see two blocks one is additional
 
01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
grant for non VX and then one is for VX
 
01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
so the non VX would be
 
01:28:23.109 --> 01:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
$597 n6 VX would be
 
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
$2,445 15 so to the right of that you'll
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
see some gray uh sorry some green blocks
 
01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
and so you'll see that the additional
 
01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
Grant uh is for um it the additional
 
01:28:37.149 --> 01:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
Grant and the base for non-vx would come
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
to that
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
9,363 60 figure in the bottom right and
 
01:28:44.189 --> 01:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
then the base plus the differentiated um
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
sorry the base and the additional grant
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
for V would come to $
 
01:28:51.310 --> 01:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
6,710 79 so it's mostly the same as
 
01:28:53.109 --> 01:28:53.119 align:start position:0%
District district adequacy the only
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
difference is being that there's
 
01:28:57.070 --> 01:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
additional Grant um that taxs on to the
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
base Aid rate as well as The Slight
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
differences uh with the special
 
01:29:03.550 --> 01:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
education that Aid being paid directly
 
01:29:05.550 --> 01:29:05.560 align:start position:0%
to the U to the town responsibility
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
District responsibility everything else
 
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
all the other rates are paid to the Char
 
01:29:10.629 --> 01:29:10.639 align:start position:0%
of school directly from the
 
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
state any questions on that before
 
01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:14.709 align:start position:0%
state any questions on that before
moving

01:29:14.709 --> 01:29:14.719 align:start position:0%
moving
 
01:29:14.719 --> 01:29:16.790 align:start position:0%
moving
forward

01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:29:19.550 --> 01:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
great the next three pages again mostly
 
01:29:21.390 --> 01:29:21.400 align:start position:0%
just reference documents so this first
 
01:29:23.310 --> 01:29:23.320 align:start position:0%
one which is page three or five that
 
01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
would be each charter school which would
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
you follow on the left side going down
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
for each row and then the ADM for each
 
01:29:31.629 --> 01:29:31.639 align:start position:0%
charter school and where they fit into
 
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
each one of those categories we just
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
described whether it's base Aid fnr
 
01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
special ification elll so this is for
 
01:29:40.270 --> 01:29:40.280 align:start position:0%
fy4 the last uh fiscal year that we
 
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
fully paid out we're currently in FIS 25
 
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
so we won't know that until the final
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
payment um after school ends and so uh
 
01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
this is FIS 24 and then you'll see those
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
four um categories that you see similar
 
01:29:55.709 --> 01:29:55.719 align:start position:0%
to district adequacy and then you'll see
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
the additional Grant there uh third from
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
the right uh so it breaks out each one
 
01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
base fnr special education El and then
 
01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
the additional Grant as well and it also
 
01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
breaks out on the very right it shows
 
01:30:10.109 --> 01:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
the second from the last is the total
 
01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
grant for students attending Charter
 
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
Schools the very right one would be the
 
01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
actual grant that the the charter
 
01:30:17.790 --> 01:30:17.800 align:start position:0%
schools receive so it backs out that
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
special education uh Aid because those
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
because that's sent to the town District
 
01:30:22.719 --> 01:30:24.310 align:start position:0%
because that's sent to the town District
responsibility

01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:30:27.310 --> 01:30:27.320 align:start position:0%
so those are all charter schools in 24
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
and then uh each one of they're the
 
01:30:31.709 --> 01:30:31.719 align:start position:0%
grants that you know through state aid
 
01:30:35.709 --> 01:30:35.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
category the next page would be four out
 
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
of five that is more of a historical
 
01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
document just explaining um the rates in
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
ADM for Charter Schools uh from FY 2017
 
01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
to 2026 so working left to right is FY
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
17 to 26 breaks down uh the this first
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh kind of top third of the sheet would
 
01:31:00.109 --> 01:31:00.119 align:start position:0%
be the rate for each type of ADM so we
 
01:31:03.109 --> 01:31:03.119 align:start position:0%
have our ADM for kindergarten in grades
 
01:31:04.510 --> 01:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
1 through 12 which was different at one
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
point in time now they're the same treat
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
the same rate and then as you work down
 
01:31:10.990 --> 01:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
fnr special ucation in Elo Mark
 
01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned there was a third grade
 
01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
reading grant that was discontinued uh
 
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
beginning FY
 
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
24 and then each one of those additional
 
01:31:19.109 --> 01:31:19.119 align:start position:0%
grants so that shows the trend and the
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
differences and increases of each rate
 
01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
uh from 2017 to 2026
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
through current law for FY 26 and then
 
01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
below that the middle uh sort of bar
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
there would be the adms uh for each one
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
of those categories throughout those
 
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
years again with the percent increase
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
and the change uh you may see one kind
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
of outlier one one sticking out would be
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
fy22 well really fy21 an increase of um
 
01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
base ADM
 
01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
963 and that was vlax through pandemic
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
that was digal enrollment through vlax
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
um so there's a bump there and then what
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
shows is a decline in ADM is really just
 
01:31:58.629 --> 01:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
returning back to normal in a way uh
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
between fy21 and 22 mostly vac students
 
01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
receiv receiving the services through
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
virtual Learning
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
Academy and then the bottom right or
 
01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
sorry bottom uh bar there is the total
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
cost of Charter Aid through each one of
 
01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
those categories uh through each fiscal
 
01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
year so the total and then breaking it
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
well and the final page again just
 
01:32:23.109 --> 01:32:23.119 align:start position:0%
mostly reference document would be every
 
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
Charter School that is currently open or
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
has closed since from FY 2007 to uh
 
01:32:32.310 --> 01:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
currently the fiscal year 25 so working
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh from the top left down be all those
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools about most of the way
 
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
down you'll see uh closed charter
 
01:32:39.790 --> 01:32:39.800 align:start position:0%
schools so those will include uh charter
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
schools that were open at one time but
 
01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
have closed um as of this fiscal year
 
01:32:45.149 --> 01:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
they are no longer
 
01:32:48.189 --> 01:32:48.199 align:start position:0%
open and then each one of the adms uh
 
01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
this is just base ADM uh through each
 
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
year and then the very bottom is where
 
01:32:54.189 --> 01:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
you'll see VX that's their FA time and
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
full-time equivalent um for students if
 
01:32:57.790 --> 01:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
there's students that are attending
 
01:33:00.189 --> 01:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
Charter uh VX part-time but they're also
 
01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
attending their resident District
 
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
fulltime those students are full-time
 
01:33:07.470 --> 01:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
equivalent um that's based on um credits
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
and percent complete that VX reports to
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
us so that's how we calculate to payment
 
01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:12.950 align:start position:0%
us so that's how we calculate to payment
for

01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
them so that's about it like I said
 
01:33:16.669 --> 01:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
mostly uh this is all reference
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
documents for Charter Schools um you
 
01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
know through the years in that very
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
first document will explain how it's
 
01:33:23.229 --> 01:33:23.239 align:start position:0%
funded in different categories again
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
similar to
 
01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:26.360 align:start position:0%
adequacy so I want to remind the
 
01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
committee that charter schools are
 
01:33:29.310 --> 01:33:29.320 align:start position:0%
authorized by the State Board of
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
Education um they're nonprofits in the
 
01:33:32.669 --> 01:33:32.679 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and they have a
 
01:33:35.709 --> 01:33:35.719 align:start position:0%
local Board of nonprofit board members
 
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
that oversee the school as opposed to a
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
traditional Public School District so
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the difference um and
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
they provide some but not all of or they
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
have to follow rather some but not all
 
01:33:47.229 --> 01:33:47.239 align:start position:0%
of the same requirements that District
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
public schools have to require so um a
 
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
good reminder to as you're working
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
through legislation if there's something
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
that you want to impact both charter
 
01:33:56.910 --> 01:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
schools and District Public Schools you
 
01:33:59.550 --> 01:33:59.560 align:start position:0%
do need to say both you need to actually
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
call out charter schools because
 
01:34:03.149 --> 01:34:03.159 align:start position:0%
otherwise charter schools are exempt if
 
01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
law does not specifically talk about a
 
01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:07.229 align:start position:0%
law does not specifically talk about a
charter

01:34:07.229 --> 01:34:07.239 align:start position:0%
charter
 
01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
school and one more to add just
 
01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
particular to funding we've seen a
 
01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
couple bills come through so far that's
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
in house um funding education funding
 
01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
that if you were if a legislator were to
 
01:34:19.790 --> 01:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
try and in we're proposing a bill to
 
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
increase District adequacy the rates
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
that we just described for Charters are
 
01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
ref refer as the same rates that are in
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
District adequacy so uh if you are
 
01:34:29.109 --> 01:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
changing one it has kind of a trickle
 
01:34:32.830 --> 01:34:32.840 align:start position:0%
effect uh waterfall effect so uh when
 
01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
there's rates being changed it will
 
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
affect not just District adequacy but
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
also Charter adequacy as well so in the
 
01:34:39.870 --> 01:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
rates case we don't need to make that
 
01:34:42.270 --> 01:34:42.280 align:start position:0%
special we don't have to refer to both
 
01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
is that no what you're saying unless you
 
01:34:45.229 --> 01:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
don't want it to impact both it will
 
01:34:47.070 --> 01:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
automatically impact both so the way it
 
01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
works so Charter Schools fall under RSA
 
01:34:53.070 --> 01:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
194b um but that refers back to rsaa 198
 
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
which is the quacy law the same for
 
01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
Education Freedom accounts which we'll
 
01:34:58.350 --> 01:34:58.360 align:start position:0%
talk about in a
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
moment representative Dy just a quick
 
01:35:03.669 --> 01:35:03.679 align:start position:0%
question on um specialized schools like
 
01:35:05.229 --> 01:35:05.239 align:start position:0%
the Monarch School of New England down
 
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
in Rochester how does that work into all
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
of these numbers because I know you're
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
funding that as well right um I that's
 
01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
that's a non-public school so they they
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
have agreements with the districts so um
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
the districts paid the nonpublic school
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
to provide those Services um um if a
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
District's educating a special education
 
01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
student they're going to receive special
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
education differential Aid um if it's a
 
01:35:30.510 --> 01:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
high cost special education student they
 
01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
might receive special education normally
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
known as catastrophic Aid um and so the
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
district would receive that money but
 
01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
then they would be paying the Monarch
 
01:35:40.109 --> 01:35:40.119 align:start position:0%
school okay so thank you yeah so we have
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
a variety of non-public schools in the
 
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
state and some of them are approved just
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
through the State Board of Education to
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
provide general education services and
 
01:35:49.709 --> 01:35:49.719 align:start position:0%
then some of them are an addition to
 
01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
that approval from the State Board of
 
01:35:52.990 --> 01:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
Education seek an additional approval
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
from our special education office then
 
01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
we'll approve them to provide special
 
01:35:59.790 --> 01:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
education services and so then if they
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
are pro being provided funding every go
 
01:36:04.270 --> 01:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
thing goes through the district the
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
district um looks at a child's IEP and
 
01:36:08.189 --> 01:36:08.199 align:start position:0%
says these are the child's disabilities
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
and I think this non-public school which
 
01:36:12.510 --> 01:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
is approved can provide those supports
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
and will place the child there and then
 
01:36:16.629 --> 01:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
through the placement um the district is
 
01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursed through the regular process
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
and we don't have any direct
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursement through the Monarch school
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
or any other non-public school okay
 
01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Murray thank you
 
01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious and I may have seen
 
01:36:33.390 --> 01:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
this and forgotten can you just give a
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
brief breakdown of the schools uh how
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
many are K through 12 how many focus on
 
01:36:39.870 --> 01:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
Elementary the Middle School how many
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
are R the high school I don't have that
 
01:36:43.470 --> 01:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
today but I can certainly bring that
 
01:36:49.390 --> 01:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:52.510 --> 01:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
much Mr L Brian can you just let the
 
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
committee know how you came up the
 
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal 26 and 27 estimates for Charter
 
01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
Schools does that assume enrollment
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
growth new schools coming on board how
 
01:37:02.350 --> 01:37:02.360 align:start position:0%
were those numbers derived sure great
 
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh yes so one the easy one
 
01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
would be uh new schools that are
 
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
estimated open FY 26 that would include
 
01:37:10.750 --> 01:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
our estimates our best guess estimates
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
working with the school and and maybe K
 
01:37:15.109 --> 01:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
can describe that better um it does also
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
include uh like you just mentioned
 
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
Trends so between what we currently have
 
01:37:20.910 --> 01:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
for FY 2025 for enrollment for each
 
01:37:23.550 --> 01:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
charter school as well as what they uh
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
reported for fy2 24 uh and that holds
 
01:37:28.030 --> 01:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
true similar how we treat District uh
 
01:37:30.149 --> 01:37:30.159 align:start position:0%
estimates as well so our estimates for
 
01:37:31.950 --> 01:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
FY 26 are using Trends based on
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
enrollment current year compared to
 
01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
historical Trends um and then including
 
01:37:39.229 --> 01:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
uh schools that are to open as well I do
 
01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
think it's important to remind the
 
01:37:41.709 --> 01:37:41.719 align:start position:0%
committee too that we have that that
 
01:37:43.470 --> 01:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
grant that I mentioned that $46 million
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
grant that Grant is specifically for
 
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
opening new and increasing um existing
 
01:37:51.390 --> 01:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools or expanding sorry
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
existing charter schools so the
 
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is in the tail
 
01:37:57.189 --> 01:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
end of that Grant meaning that we are
 
01:37:59.070 --> 01:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
providing funds to groups that would
 
01:38:00.990 --> 01:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
like to start new Charter Schools
 
01:38:02.669 --> 01:38:02.679 align:start position:0%
allowable use of funds is a pretty
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
rigorous process um and then once the
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
school's open they're not really
 
01:38:08.109 --> 01:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
entitled to any more startup grants
 
01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
that's when they go into just the
 
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
regular formula um charter schools in a
 
01:38:13.790 --> 01:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
time where we wouldn't have a grant
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
there will be less charter schools
 
01:38:18.990 --> 01:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
opening Rob papich thank you Mr chair
 
01:38:21.149 --> 01:38:21.159 align:start position:0%
and again thank you for your patience
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
this afternoon um I asked a similar
 
01:38:26.189 --> 01:38:26.199 align:start position:0%
question in education funding in regards
 
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
to the kids who are taking ESL you know
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
who are categorized as is English as a
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
second language I uh wanted to repeat
 
01:38:37.070 --> 01:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
the question here so everybody's aware
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
of the discussion right that I'm trying
 
01:38:41.709 --> 01:38:41.719 align:start position:0%
to understand how many years should a
 
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
child be in an ESL program before they
 
01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
are supposed to know English and no
 
01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
longer be an ESL kid and um in addition
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
to what we were talking about a few days
 
01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
ago I wanted to know if the department
 
01:38:58.910 --> 01:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
has information indicating how many
 
01:39:01.390 --> 01:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
years does a kid spend in an ESL program
 
01:39:03.629 --> 01:39:03.639 align:start position:0%
do you just get totals are you told that
 
01:39:06.589 --> 01:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
a specific student is in that program
 
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
just I I I want to understand what you
 
01:39:11.950 --> 01:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
guys have and again what you feedback
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
you can provide on the appropriate
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
amount of time for a child who comes in
 
01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
as English as a second language to
 
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
become proficient in English and no no
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
longer require those Services thank you
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
sure um so we do have um a person of the
 
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education paid through by
 
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
one of those federal grants the English
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
language learner Grant who specializes
 
01:39:34.149 --> 01:39:34.159 align:start position:0%
in this area so I can see if they are
 
01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
available for our presentation on
 
01:39:37.510 --> 01:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
Wednesday if not I believe Melissa the
 
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
director might be able to provide more
 
01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
information as far as your questions
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
about the data though um so when we um
 
01:39:45.310 --> 01:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
collect information on a student a
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
school will specify if the student is an
 
01:39:49.589 --> 01:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
English language learner student and
 
01:39:51.790 --> 01:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
that means um one we will know how
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
they're uh performing on the English
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
language learner assessment because
 
01:39:57.229 --> 01:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
there's an assessment to specifically to
 
01:39:59.070 --> 01:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
gauge a students's understanding of the
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
English language and then also if the
 
01:40:03.189 --> 01:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
student is receiving additional supports
 
01:40:04.589 --> 01:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
around them being an English language
 
01:40:07.149 --> 01:40:07.159 align:start position:0%
learner um so we have that information
 
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
on the student when we collect that
 
01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
information but as far as how many years
 
01:40:14.350 --> 01:40:14.360 align:start position:0%
I I'm I don't have that
 
01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
information thank you um given that you
 
01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
guys seem to have that information on
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
individual student level would it be
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
possible to have a some analysis not by
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
individual obviously but you know out of
 
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
the kids in the ESL program so many of
 
01:40:31.950 --> 01:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
them are in the their first year here
 
01:40:33.629 --> 01:40:33.639 align:start position:0%
some so many of them are in the second
 
01:40:36.510 --> 01:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
year and so on again if you aggregate it
 
01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
at the state level there shouldn't be
 
01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
any privacy concerns and all I'm looking
 
01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
for is to Total Statewide nothing uh
 
01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:44.229 align:start position:0%
for is to Total Statewide nothing uh
District

01:40:44.229 --> 01:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:52.350 --> 01:40:52.360 align:start position:0%
you any other Charter stuff before we
 
01:40:54.109 --> 01:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
switch topics
 
01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
all right we'll switch to
 
01:41:42.589 --> 01:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:45.310 --> 01:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
all right last up for today um we're
 
01:41:47.589 --> 01:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
going to talk about education Freedom
 
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
accounts um or efas in other states they
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
are known as education savings accounts
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the national terminology
 
01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
or some states have a voucher type
 
01:41:58.629 --> 01:41:58.639 align:start position:0%
program but in New Hampshire we call
 
01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
them education Freedom accounts um so
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts are a um
 
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
funding that allows uh parents to
 
01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:11.719 align:start position:0%
provide or provides funding to parents
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
to make educational choices for their
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
children outside of a resident District
 
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
school or a public charter school the
 
01:42:20.430 --> 01:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
way the funding formula works is very
 
01:42:23.149 --> 01:42:23.159 align:start position:0%
similar to the same way the funding
 
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
formula works for the other two programs
 
01:42:26.109 --> 01:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
we've talked about today so when you
 
01:42:28.229 --> 01:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
look at page two on your packet um
 
01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to see some numbers that
 
01:42:32.350 --> 01:42:32.360 align:start position:0%
look very familiar um because just like
 
01:42:34.470 --> 01:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
the charter schools uh the education
 
01:42:36.510 --> 01:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
Freedom account numbers are based on the
 
01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 198 adequacy numbers um and there
 
01:42:41.709 --> 01:42:41.719 align:start position:0%
are no additional differentials that are
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
on the education Freedom account program
 
01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
so the way it works in New Hampshire a
 
01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:48.639 align:start position:0%
little high level is so the law um which
 
01:42:52.470 --> 01:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
was passed in hb2 and 2021 um
 
01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
established the program starting in
 
01:42:56.229 --> 01:42:56.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 the program right now is
 
01:42:59.589 --> 01:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
in its fourth year of operation um and
 
01:43:02.589 --> 01:43:02.599 align:start position:0%
it provides funds um or requires the
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to provide the
 
01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
funds to a scholarship organization and
 
01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
then the scholarship organization is
 
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
required to determine students eligible
 
01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
for these funds and then distribute
 
01:43:16.750 --> 01:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
These funds into a digital wallet the
 
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
the state law actually requires use of a
 
01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
digital wallet system that then the
 
01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
parents can access these funds to pray
 
01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
for educational expenses associated with
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
the child um so this means that um the
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Education um collects data
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
from the student from the scholarship
 
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
organization in the same way that we do
 
01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
from traditional Public Schools we
 
01:43:41.189 --> 01:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
collect student level SD level data um
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
we do a calculation to see how much that
 
01:43:45.629 --> 01:43:45.639 align:start position:0%
child um should receive if they should
 
01:43:47.470 --> 01:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
receive a base amount a free a free and
 
01:43:48.910 --> 01:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch amount a special education
 
01:43:50.430 --> 01:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
amount or an English language learner
 
01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
amount and then it's dispersed four
 
01:43:54.629 --> 01:43:54.639 align:start position:0%
times throughout the year um to the
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization the scholarship
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
organization is allowed to keep up to
 
01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
10% off the top for administration of
 
01:44:03.709 --> 01:44:03.719 align:start position:0%
the accounts and the remaining funds go
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
into the digital wallet so the amounts
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about today so just
 
01:44:10.709 --> 01:44:10.719 align:start position:0%
like we talked about before
 
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
$426 for every kid is the base amount um
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
4,200 uh two
 
01:44:19.109 --> 01:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
$2,392 is the amount for a free and
 
01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
$2,184 is a special education amount and
 
01:44:27.790 --> 01:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
$832 is the amount for um an English
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
language learner
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
student and the on that page also you
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
have the dispersement schedule so we
 
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
disperse it throughout the year four
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
times based on counts just like we do
 
01:44:39.589 --> 01:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
with um District public schools and
 
01:44:41.229 --> 01:44:41.239 align:start position:0%
Charter Public
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
Schools um similar to Charter Schools
 
01:44:47.589 --> 01:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
EFA accounts are paid in real time too
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
so remember District Charter district
 
01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
schools are paid one years and rear
 
01:44:52.669 --> 01:44:52.679 align:start position:0%
charter schools and education Freedom
 
01:44:56.550 --> 01:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:00.030 --> 01:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
year so the next page in your packet is
 
01:45:02.830 --> 01:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
page number three um it is a lot bigger
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
than this ADM history that you've seen
 
01:45:06.270 --> 01:45:06.280 align:start position:0%
for the other programs but that's just
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
because it's very few years that have
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
been in operation so in 10 more years
 
01:45:12.350 --> 01:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
the other one's going to be really small
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
as well um but so you can see the kind
 
01:45:16.990 --> 01:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
of the trends that we've had so you can
 
01:45:19.629 --> 01:45:19.639 align:start position:0%
see on line six so the first year of the
 
01:45:23.149 --> 01:45:23.159 align:start position:0%
program count on October 1st was 1,635
 
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
kids the second year is
 
01:45:29.589 --> 01:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
3,25 the third year 4,211 and then um as
 
01:45:32.229 --> 01:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
of um this year or our estimate for this
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
year is
 
01:45:36.109 --> 01:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
5,852 so those are kind of the numbers
 
01:45:37.470 --> 01:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
that we have and then we kind of show
 
01:45:39.149 --> 01:45:39.159 align:start position:0%
you the total dollar amounts so $8
 
01:45:42.750 --> 01:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
million the first year 14.6 the 2 22 in
 
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 and this year we're
 
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
anticipating the program to be $30
 
01:45:48.550 --> 01:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
million um these funds are drawn from
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund as required by
 
01:45:53.070 --> 01:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom account law and
 
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
it's also an allowable use of the
 
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
education trust fund under the law that
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
establishes the education trust
 
01:46:01.870 --> 01:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
fund the next thing in your packet um is
 
01:46:04.350 --> 01:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
just the towns and the counts from each
 
01:46:07.229 --> 01:46:07.239 align:start position:0%
town so um this looks obviously a lot
 
01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
like the adequacy spreadsheet that you
 
01:46:11.149 --> 01:46:11.159 align:start position:0%
saw before but the funding does not go
 
01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
to the town this just represents the
 
01:46:14.669 --> 01:46:14.679 align:start position:0%
resident town of the
 
01:46:17.950 --> 01:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
student flip through all those
 
01:46:20.910 --> 01:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
pages um and that's current year too so
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
if you look at the very last column we
 
01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
haven't made the April dispersement yet
 
01:46:26.990 --> 01:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
so that one that's why that's blank so
 
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
is that tracking the amount that's still
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
going to the town even though the
 
01:46:33.070 --> 01:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
student is gone no this this is the
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
amount that's specifically dispersed to
 
01:46:37.109 --> 01:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
the scholarship Organization for funding
 
01:46:38.709 --> 01:46:38.719 align:start position:0%
the child's
 
01:46:41.709 --> 01:46:41.719 align:start position:0%
EFA but next thing in your packet on
 
01:46:45.070 --> 01:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
page nine is the phase out Grant so the
 
01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
phase out Grant um when the legislature
 
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
established this program wanted to
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
provide additional supports for school
 
01:46:54.589 --> 01:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
districts well um fund uh when for one
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
these a student left a public school
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
district to take an EFA um and so in the
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
very first year that a student accesses
 
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
the EFA because adequacy is paid one
 
01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
year in re the school district has 100%
 
01:47:09.470 --> 01:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
of those adequacy funds still available
 
01:47:12.430 --> 01:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
to them um we in New Hampshire pay for
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
the student where they attend the school
 
01:47:16.589 --> 01:47:16.599 align:start position:0%
we've always been that way so when we're
 
01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
talking about the adms for um adequacy
 
01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
that Mark was talking about before those
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
only include kids in enrolled in your
 
01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
public school so if you had
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers or non-public school kids
 
01:47:28.669 --> 01:47:28.679 align:start position:0%
and I say non-public schools we use the
 
01:47:30.189 --> 01:47:30.199 align:start position:0%
term non-public school in New Hampshire
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
not private school just remember that
 
01:47:34.070 --> 01:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
also when writing laws because that's
 
01:47:36.750 --> 01:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
that can be tricky um but so non-public
 
01:47:38.669 --> 01:47:38.679 align:start position:0%
school kids if those kids are in your
 
01:47:40.669 --> 01:47:40.679 align:start position:0%
town you're not receiving adequacy for
 
01:47:43.709 --> 01:47:43.719 align:start position:0%
those kids um so when a student leaves
 
01:47:46.030 --> 01:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
um a public school to take an EFA once
 
01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
the kid is no longer there then the
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
public school would not receive any
 
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:51.719 align:start position:0%
additional funds for that child um so
 
01:47:53.310 --> 01:47:53.320 align:start position:0%
the phase out Grant was a a grant that
 
01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
was implemented as part of this program
 
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
to subsidize for the fact that the
 
01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
students are leaving to allow the school
 
01:48:00.430 --> 01:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
districts to have time to account for
 
01:48:02.350 --> 01:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
the kids leaving so in the very first
 
01:48:03.870 --> 01:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
year that there's no kid they' receive
 
01:48:05.950 --> 01:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
100% of their aid because that is
 
01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
working in one year in a re like regular
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
adequacy and the second year that the
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
kid leaves you get a grant of 50% of the
 
01:48:14.189 --> 01:48:14.199 align:start position:0%
adequacy that would be calculated for
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
that student and it's a very precise
 
01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
calculation so if the student was an
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
English language learner and a special
 
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
education kid you get that amount for
 
01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
that kid if they were just an English if
 
01:48:24.990 --> 01:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
they were just a base kid then you get
 
01:48:26.910 --> 01:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
just the base amount and we actually
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
even account for if the kid was in the
 
01:48:30.030 --> 01:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
public school half of the year you would
 
01:48:31.629 --> 01:48:31.639 align:start position:0%
get half of that amount those when you
 
01:48:33.709 --> 01:48:33.719 align:start position:0%
asked before that 08 kid it's being
 
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
accounted for in this formula as well um
 
01:48:38.830 --> 01:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
and then the last year um you get 25%
 
01:48:40.510 --> 01:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
and so it kind of creates layers for
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
these kids um and so we on the
 
01:48:44.910 --> 01:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet or the sheet here you have
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
the colors the colors are really helpful
 
01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
because it kind of helps you follow the
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
years that those kids would be getting
 
01:48:51.070 --> 01:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
the schools would be getting grants for
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
those kids um and the phase out Grant in
 
01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
law it ends on July 1st
 
01:48:59.790 --> 01:48:59.800 align:start position:0%
2026 um so that means that the kids that
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
take um an EFA for fiscal year 26 those
 
01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
are the last kids that would receive a
 
01:49:06.510 --> 01:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
phase out Grant and no additional phase
 
01:49:09.229 --> 01:49:09.239 align:start position:0%
out grants would be paid after that to
 
01:49:09.239 --> 01:49:11.709 align:start position:0%
out grants would be paid after that to
public

01:49:11.709 --> 01:49:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:15.229 --> 01:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
schools and then um the information in
 
01:49:17.189 --> 01:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
is actually it's just a a very long
 
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
document but it just kind of it shows
 
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
you the calculation and it shows you
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
which schools are Act which kids have
 
01:49:26.109 --> 01:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
actually left um or which districts have
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
actually left and they're receiving a
 
01:49:29.149 --> 01:49:29.159 align:start position:0%
phase out grant for those kids so that's
 
01:49:30.550 --> 01:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
the information there and again you have
 
01:49:34.589 --> 01:49:34.599 align:start position:0%
a town by town in the packet and that is
 
01:49:36.310 --> 01:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
it oh and the last thing that I put on
 
01:49:39.070 --> 01:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
your packet um is a document from the
 
01:49:42.189 --> 01:49:42.199 align:start position:0%
children's Scholarship Foundation um but
 
01:49:45.510 --> 01:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
these are the um poverty guidelines for
 
01:49:47.229 --> 01:49:47.239 align:start position:0%
eligibility for Education Freedom
 
01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
account so the first year that the
 
01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
program passed it was 300% of federal
 
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
poverty um and then year three and four
 
01:49:58.189 --> 01:49:58.199 align:start position:0%
are 350% of federal poverty so there's
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
some questions or there some Bill
 
01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
proposals to change it to 5 100% or
 
01:50:04.750 --> 01:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
other numbers and so these kind of I
 
01:50:06.189 --> 01:50:06.199 align:start position:0%
just put this there for informational
 
01:50:19.149 --> 01:50:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:23.790 --> 01:50:23.800 align:start position:0%
this any other questions represent wer
 
01:50:26.550 --> 01:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
is there uh any example of an EFA
 
01:50:28.629 --> 01:50:28.639 align:start position:0%
student going from one District to
 
01:50:31.709 --> 01:50:31.719 align:start position:0%
another public school there are yes not
 
01:50:34.030 --> 01:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
very many but there are a few is there a
 
01:50:36.109 --> 01:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
problem with that they're bringing the
 
01:50:39.229 --> 01:50:39.239 align:start position:0%
EFA Grant but they're not bringing the
 
01:50:41.229 --> 01:50:41.239 align:start position:0%
same amount of money that the students
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
have funded for right so just like a um
 
01:50:46.109 --> 01:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
District public school could charge
 
01:50:47.709 --> 01:50:47.719 align:start position:0%
tuition to another District Public
 
01:50:50.109 --> 01:50:50.119 align:start position:0%
School the district public school could
 
01:50:51.790 --> 01:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
charge a tuition amount to the EFA
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
student um and they can set that tuition
 
01:50:56.189 --> 01:50:56.199 align:start position:0%
amount um there's nothing in this law
 
01:50:57.790 --> 01:50:57.800 align:start position:0%
that requires them to set that tuition
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
amount on a certain amount um so the
 
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
student can use their EFA and then
 
01:51:04.270 --> 01:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
potentially additional funds that they
 
01:51:06.629 --> 01:51:06.639 align:start position:0%
have accessible to them as a family um
 
01:51:08.350 --> 01:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
if the tuition amount is higher than the
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:15.750 --> 01:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
you Rob on Kelly thank you I have
 
01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
several questions go right through them
 
01:51:21.510 --> 01:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
okay so um could you please walk us
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
through how those EFA accounts
 
01:51:28.109 --> 01:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
work it's a you're referring to it as a
 
01:51:30.229 --> 01:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
wallet is that like a debit card or how
 
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
does that work um that would be a
 
01:51:33.390 --> 01:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
question that would be better for the
 
01:51:35.189 --> 01:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization that implements
 
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
the program the department doesn't do
 
01:51:38.270 --> 01:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
that work
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
directly okay so how would I ask that
 
01:51:43.990 --> 01:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
question of them um just I think email
 
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
it I that would be the best thing would
 
01:51:48.189 --> 01:51:48.199 align:start position:0%
be to email them directly
 
01:51:51.990 --> 01:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right still have um I
 
01:51:54.189 --> 01:51:54.199 align:start position:0%
understand that the money in the EFA
 
01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
account is non-aps and it can roll over
 
01:51:59.430 --> 01:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
from year to year so I'm wondering if
 
01:52:02.510 --> 01:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
there's a limmit to how many years that
 
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
lapse can
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
continue um so as long as the student is
 
01:52:08.069 --> 01:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the program the funds can
 
01:52:11.709 --> 01:52:11.719 align:start position:0%
roll over um once the kid um finish
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
finishes their education the funding
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
would come back to the education trust
 
01:52:17.470 --> 01:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
fund um but it it it can roll over for
 
01:52:19.069 --> 01:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
the time that the student is in the
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
program so that's possible to be sort of
 
01:52:26.709 --> 01:52:26.719 align:start position:0%
a 10year 12E rollover um in in theory if
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
you weren't using any of the funds um to
 
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
educate the child but you would think
 
01:52:33.149 --> 01:52:33.159 align:start position:0%
you know if you're educating the kids
 
01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
funding is coming from someplace
 
01:52:38.229 --> 01:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
01:52:42.069 --> 01:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
um Can the student or the family use the
 
01:52:42.079 --> 01:52:43.270 align:start position:0%
um Can the student or the family use the
money

01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
for a college account um and other words
 
01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
in here in the RS in the
 
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
rsas under 19 4 F2 there's M says
 
01:52:57.870 --> 01:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
tuition and fees at an institution of
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
higher education so is that how does
 
01:53:03.390 --> 01:53:03.400 align:start position:0%
that work if the student reaches age 18
 
01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:04.270 align:start position:0%
that work if the student reaches age 18
or

01:53:04.270 --> 01:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:53:06.750 --> 01:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
graduates what does this line mean for
 
01:53:09.390 --> 01:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
higher education is that college so it's
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to be for kids kindergarten
 
01:53:12.990 --> 01:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
through grades 12 um as far as what
 
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
isn't isn't educationally appropriate
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
for that student the scholarship
 
01:53:17.709 --> 01:53:17.719 align:start position:0%
organization has the ability to
 
01:53:19.470 --> 01:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
determine that so the scholarship
 
01:53:21.149 --> 01:53:21.159 align:start position:0%
organization may be able to tell you
 
01:53:23.350 --> 01:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
when when they are are not accessing
 
01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:24.790 align:start position:0%
when when they are are not accessing
that

01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:28.990 --> 01:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
line so at the very end when the student
 
01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:31.679 align:start position:0%
graduates 18 or graduates if there's any
 
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
money left in the account those funds
 
01:53:35.629 --> 01:53:35.639 align:start position:0%
are supposed to come back to the state
 
01:53:38.709 --> 01:53:38.719 align:start position:0%
yes so I suppose uh do you can you tell
 
01:53:40.510 --> 01:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
me how that happens do so the
 
01:53:42.430 --> 01:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization um we actually
 
01:53:44.189 --> 01:53:44.199 align:start position:0%
do a Reconciliation process with the
 
01:53:46.109 --> 01:53:46.119 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization every year
 
01:53:47.589 --> 01:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
where we look at all of the kids that we
 
01:53:50.669 --> 01:53:50.679 align:start position:0%
disperse funds for um and we can see for
 
01:53:53.310 --> 01:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
example if the child left the education
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
Freedom account and went back to a
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
public school um and that would show up
 
01:53:58.990 --> 01:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
on the public schools roster and this is
 
01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
something that happens throughout the
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
years a pretty intensive reconciliation
 
01:54:05.790 --> 01:54:05.800 align:start position:0%
process where we review the child um we
 
01:54:08.830 --> 01:54:08.840 align:start position:0%
would reduce any remaining account or we
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
would um we would calculate the
 
01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
remaining account and the scholarship
 
01:54:14.189 --> 01:54:14.199 align:start position:0%
organization would review that and
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
reduce any remaining funds in the in the
 
01:54:18.510 --> 01:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
account and give them back to us for
 
01:54:21.870 --> 01:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
that appropriate time of period of time
 
01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:26.350 align:start position:0%
that appropriate time of period of time
okay

01:54:26.350 --> 01:54:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
okay I think that's that's it for now
 
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
okay I have others but I'll wait go
 
01:54:33.750 --> 01:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
ahead if you well I'm not sure if you
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
can answer this I'm wondering about the
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
Amazon account we were told before that
 
01:54:41.669 --> 01:54:41.679 align:start position:0%
um the family can access an Amazon
 
01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
account I'm wondering if there's a list
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
of books that are provided to the family
 
01:54:50.669 --> 01:54:50.679 align:start position:0%
or the student yeah that again would be
 
01:54:53.069 --> 01:54:53.079 align:start position:0%
a question for um scholarship
 
01:54:55.270 --> 01:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
organization so I would remind you that
 
01:54:58.390 --> 01:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature has determined that the
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization is the group
 
01:55:02.990 --> 01:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
that is responsible for implementing
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
this program the department of
 
01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
education's um Authority kind of ends
 
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
with uh it I believe it says the
 
01:55:12.270 --> 01:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Education shall transfer
 
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
to a scholarship organization an amount
 
01:55:18.109 --> 01:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
for the EFA um so the Department of
 
01:55:21.790 --> 01:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
Education has um you know oversight
 
01:55:23.550 --> 01:55:23.560 align:start position:0%
relative to to the contract but as far
 
01:55:25.950 --> 01:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
as deter determining what is and isn't
 
01:55:27.470 --> 01:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
educationally appropriate for the
 
01:55:29.790 --> 01:55:29.800 align:start position:0%
student that the legislature wrote the
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
law so that that is the responsibility
 
01:55:34.149 --> 01:55:34.159 align:start position:0%
of the scholarship organization okay
 
01:55:34.159 --> 01:55:39.470 align:start position:0%
of the scholarship organization okay
thank

01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:42.270 --> 01:55:42.280 align:start position:0%
you Al said you're still looking okay
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative papovich thank you Mr
 
01:55:47.470 --> 01:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
chair um just to make sure that you know
 
01:55:48.990 --> 01:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee is on the
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
same page would it be accurate to say
 
01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:52.750 align:start position:0%
same page would it be accurate to say
that

01:55:52.750 --> 01:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
the only appropriate use of any funds in
 
01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
an EFA account is for the education of
 
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
that child that the uh you know account
 
01:56:05.870 --> 01:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
is in the name of yes thank you and um
 
01:56:07.229 --> 01:56:07.239 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on one of the
 
01:56:09.030 --> 01:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
questions from my
 
01:56:11.709 --> 01:56:11.719 align:start position:0%
colleague did you see any meaningful
 
01:56:14.069 --> 01:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
amount of money being returned to you
 
01:56:15.709 --> 01:56:15.719 align:start position:0%
through that process where the student
 
01:56:17.950 --> 01:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
reaches the end of their K through 12
 
01:56:20.270 --> 01:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
education and there is still unspent
 
01:56:22.669 --> 01:56:22.679 align:start position:0%
money in the account any anything any
 
01:56:24.910 --> 01:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
color you can add to I don't know off of
 
01:56:26.910 --> 01:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
the top of my head um relative to
 
01:56:29.709 --> 01:56:29.719 align:start position:0%
students ending the program um I do know
 
01:56:31.589 --> 01:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
that there are far a fair number of
 
01:56:33.790 --> 01:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
students that at the beginning of the
 
01:56:36.589 --> 01:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
year consider an EFA account and then
 
01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
throughout the course of the Year return
 
01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.159 align:start position:0%
to public school and so that
 
01:56:43.350 --> 01:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
reconciliation process we are um very
 
01:56:45.470 --> 01:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
confident in that reconciliation process
 
01:56:47.069 --> 01:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
but there are a fair number of kids that
 
01:56:49.229 --> 01:56:49.239 align:start position:0%
do go back to their public school and so
 
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
then therefore the scholarship
 
01:56:51.709 --> 01:56:51.719 align:start position:0%
organization returns all those
 
01:56:53.709 --> 01:56:53.719 align:start position:0%
additional funds and the way that works
 
01:56:55.669 --> 01:56:55.679 align:start position:0%
is is that the public school reports to
 
01:56:57.629 --> 01:56:57.639 align:start position:0%
us the day that they returned to public
 
01:56:59.109 --> 01:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
school and then we calculate the amount
 
01:57:00.750 --> 01:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
of money that they would have received
 
01:57:03.229 --> 01:57:03.239 align:start position:0%
through that period of time thank you
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair if I may suggest given that
 
01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
there is interesting conversations with
 
01:57:10.750 --> 01:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization would it be
 
01:57:13.229 --> 01:57:13.239 align:start position:0%
possible to uh you know maybe ask Mr
 
01:57:14.910 --> 01:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
landrian to see if they would be willing
 
01:57:17.589 --> 01:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
to come in and talk to us at a later
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
date so we can you know get everything
 
01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:21.679 align:start position:0%
straight from the horse's mouth on tape
 
01:57:24.510 --> 01:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:25.830 align:start position:0%
 
thank

01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
you representative Murray thank you very
 
01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
much uh so there's a little hole in my
 
01:57:34.030 --> 01:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
brain can you connect sort of the dots
 
01:57:38.109 --> 01:57:38.119 align:start position:0%
to whom is the scholarship organization
 
01:57:40.069 --> 01:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
accountable if they're not accountable
 
01:57:41.629 --> 01:57:41.639 align:start position:0%
to you to you the Department of
 
01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
Education to whom are they accountable
 
01:57:46.990 --> 01:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
um so the scholarship organization is
 
01:57:48.350 --> 01:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
responsible for following all of the
 
01:57:51.550 --> 01:57:51.560 align:start position:0%
laws in RSA 194f and there's a bunch of
 
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
different things that the scholarship
 
01:57:54.629 --> 01:57:54.639 align:start position:0%
organization has to do within certain
 
01:57:56.709 --> 01:57:56.719 align:start position:0%
things with in certain time periods so
 
01:57:57.950 --> 01:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
there's certain reporting that they have
 
01:57:59.669 --> 01:57:59.679 align:start position:0%
to do for the Department of Education
 
01:58:01.189 --> 01:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
there's certain report reporting that
 
01:58:02.669 --> 01:58:02.679 align:start position:0%
they have to do to the Department of
 
01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue because they're registered under
 
01:58:06.709 --> 01:58:06.719 align:start position:0%
77g there's certain requirements that
 
01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
they're required to do because they're a
 
01:58:09.629 --> 01:58:09.639 align:start position:0%
nonprofit to the charal trust unit at
 
01:58:11.709 --> 01:58:11.719 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office um and
 
01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
there's um also reporting there's a
 
01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee for the
 
01:58:17.470 --> 01:58:17.480 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts that um the
 
01:58:19.709 --> 01:58:19.719 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization attends so
 
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
there are a fair number of um different
 
01:58:26.550 --> 01:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
things throughout um RSA 194f and all um
 
01:58:30.149 --> 01:58:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:32.589 --> 01:58:32.599 align:start position:0%
laws thank you again so some of us have
 
01:58:34.270 --> 01:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
been looking for some of these documents
 
01:58:36.149 --> 01:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
to see you know what accountability
 
01:58:38.069 --> 01:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
proposals or you know follow-ups that
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
they're doing and we're having a hard
 
01:58:43.470 --> 01:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
time finding this information um if we
 
01:58:45.790 --> 01:58:45.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to be able to examine the
 
01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
documents that support the
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
accountability how would we do that um I
 
01:58:52.189 --> 01:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
would recommend talking to the children
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
Scholarship Foundation um the documents
 
01:58:55.550 --> 01:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
that they're required to report to the
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Education the Department
 
01:58:58.589 --> 01:58:58.599 align:start position:0%
of Education makes available or the
 
01:59:00.149 --> 01:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
summary of the documents a lot of the
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
information they provide to the
 
01:59:03.390 --> 01:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is student
 
01:59:05.229 --> 01:59:05.239 align:start position:0%
identifiable information so it's
 
01:59:07.310 --> 01:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
summarized say like in the town by Town
 
01:59:10.189 --> 01:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
kind of calculations here or our various
 
01:59:12.109 --> 01:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
um different different reconciliation
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
processes um but the children's
 
01:59:15.589 --> 01:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
Scholarship Foundation would be the best
 
01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
uh group for that thank
 
01:59:20.430 --> 01:59:20.440 align:start position:0%

02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
seeing free and reduced lunch
 
02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
eligibility as the proxy for poverty
 
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
here in education but so if you're
 
02:00:25.870 --> 02:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
changing um eligibility requirements on
 
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
that side of things it could impact some
 
02:00:28.629 --> 02:00:28.639 align:start position:0%
of these other programs so we'll be here
 
02:00:32.030 --> 02:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
to talk about that um we will also have
 
02:00:34.709 --> 02:00:34.719 align:start position:0%
um Tim Carney to talk about uh the
 
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
building facilities program he'll talk
 
02:00:38.109 --> 02:00:38.119 align:start position:0%
about building Aid lease Aid and safe
 
02:00:39.669 --> 02:00:39.679 align:start position:0%
grants Public School infrastructure
 
02:00:42.430 --> 02:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
grants um Mickey did we have oh we were
 
02:00:44.910 --> 02:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
talking about Jeff right oh special
 
02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
education special educ Melissa will be
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
here to talk about special education um
 
02:00:50.430 --> 02:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
and we know there's a lot of proposed
 
02:00:51.950 --> 02:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
legislation and questions and concern
 
02:00:54.669 --> 02:00:54.679 align:start position:0%
concerns relative to um the state
 
02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
special education formula specifically
 
02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
so she'll be here to talk about that and
 
02:01:00.350 --> 02:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
then we have we can have Jeff but I
 
02:01:02.510 --> 02:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if we'll have time for him
 
02:01:04.669 --> 02:01:04.679 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe Jeff on another day but that
 
02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
so the topics so and and back to the um
 
02:01:11.109 --> 02:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
the packet the one that says um ETF
 
02:01:13.149 --> 02:01:13.159 align:start position:0%
District before you get that who's the
 
02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
last person you mumbled about there oh
 
02:01:16.470 --> 02:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
Jeff is the administrator of the career
 
02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
and Tech education program so does he
 
02:01:20.750 --> 02:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
speak a
 
02:01:24.069 --> 02:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
lot uh so we were just thinking with the
 
02:01:25.390 --> 02:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
number of programs ahead of that it
 
02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
might be a lot for that afternoon so if
 
02:01:28.510 --> 02:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
we don't get to tuition and
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
transportation or CT programs we'll make
 
02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
sure the department can answer those
 
02:01:33.589 --> 02:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
questions when they come in with their
 
02:01:35.109 --> 02:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
budget hearing after the budget comes
 
02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
out and and Melissa will be here so I
 
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
don't think we were going to have Jeff
 
02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
but Melissa who is the director of um
 
02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
those Bureau will be here and we'll be
 
02:01:44.109 --> 02:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
able to talk about it high level too
 
02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
this might be helpful to get some over
 
02:01:47.350 --> 02:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
side of that before we actually get into
 
02:01:48.430 --> 02:01:48.440 align:start position:0%
the budget when we're going to be more
 
02:01:52.149 --> 02:01:52.159 align:start position:0%
focused on the numbers so that's fine if
 
02:01:53.430 --> 02:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
if she can present it that that's that's
 
02:01:54.430 --> 02:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
totally fine you don't need to bring
 
02:01:57.189 --> 02:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
bring a special person in um I'll talk
 
02:01:59.750 --> 02:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
to her and Jeff and see what's available
 
02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
um but so I was just going to remind you
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
so on the original packet here the
 
02:02:04.189 --> 02:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
education funding orientation ones is
 
02:02:07.069 --> 02:02:07.079 align:start position:0%
ETF so this one is kind of these are all
 
02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
the things that you're going to probably
 
02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
need to make decisions on relative to
 
02:02:12.229 --> 02:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
the Department's budget um the
 
02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
department other you know the other
 
02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
things in our budget are I'd say im
 
02:02:18.069 --> 02:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
material compared to these programs and
 
02:02:20.030 --> 02:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
these are the ones that the impacts go
 
02:02:22.709 --> 02:02:22.719 align:start position:0%
directly to school districts you can see
 
02:02:24.870 --> 02:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
measurable impacts on your towns that
 
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
you represent when you're looking at
 
02:02:27.870 --> 02:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
these programs so these are the things
 
02:02:28.709 --> 02:02:28.719 align:start position:0%
that you're going to want to make
 
02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
decisions on that are going to be
 
02:02:31.950 --> 02:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
probably the harder decisions that you
 
02:02:33.270 --> 02:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
have to make throughout this budget
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
process um and so we've covered the
 
02:02:37.069 --> 02:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
majority of them but if there's
 
02:02:38.270 --> 02:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
something on here that you're seeing
 
02:02:39.950 --> 02:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
that we don't cover today and Wednesday
 
02:02:42.270 --> 02:02:42.280 align:start position:0%
definitely let me know um and we can do
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
that as
 
02:02:46.669 --> 02:02:46.679 align:start position:0%
well so so is that the orientation one
 
02:02:48.990 --> 02:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
you were talking about yeah yep um the
 
02:02:50.790 --> 02:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
one that says ETF and School District
 
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
Finance documents
 
02:02:57.870 --> 02:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:00.510 --> 02:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
had wrong
 
02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
one she named them differently in the I
 
02:03:06.510 --> 02:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
took the date off yeah when I sent them
 
02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:10.400 align:start position:0%

02:03:17.149 --> 02:03:17.159 align:start position:0%

02:03:18.910 --> 02:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
try trying to recycle these as much as
 
02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
possible you know we're trying to have
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
one thing so we can talk about it
 
02:03:22.350 --> 02:03:22.360 align:start position:0%
