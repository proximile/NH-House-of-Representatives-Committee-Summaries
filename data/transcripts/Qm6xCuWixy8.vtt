bill

00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
77 finance all to do
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
relative to the fees and services of the
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
sheriff's and deputy sheriffs
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
we're asking for a minor increase of
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
service fees
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
these fees have not been increased
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
since about 2010 inflation obviously has
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
raised the cost of fuel wages
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
mailings cost of cruises every other
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
aspect to the writ of services
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
costs have all been absorbed by the
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in each county
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
and as sheriffs responsible for these
 
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.350 align:start position:0%
and as sheriffs responsible for these
services

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
we feel it's time to increase the fees
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
so that the share of some
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
of the costs with the actual entities
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
that are using the services
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
the average increase is about five
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
dollars per service
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
um the postage increase will reflect a
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
more accurate cost
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
to mail some of the packets we receive
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
this will offset
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
costs from the taxpayers to the person
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
requesting the service
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
there is a mechanism in place for people
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
who need this service
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
to seek an exception upon motion to the
 
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.509 align:start position:0%
to seek an exception upon motion to the
court

00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
to have the fees waived we feel the
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
proposed increase
 
00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:33.519 align:start position:0%
are modest and we ask that you find this
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your consideration if
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
you have any questions i'd
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
be welcome to answer any questions for
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
the sheriff and
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you sheriff did
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
you get a look at the
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
amendment i personally have not
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
what what the amendment i believe does
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
and you'll hear about it shortly if you
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
stay on
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
is to put the the funding
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
into the counties to make the decision
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
on how much to pay the sheriff
 
00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
so it would be part of the direct part
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
of the county budget which more or less
 
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
it is now but
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
the increase would be allowed by the
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
county delegation so
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
that's more or less i believe what the
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
amendment will say and
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
we'll be coming to that later on we have
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
another person

i'm the executive director for the new
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire association for justice

which is a statewide professional
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
association of trial attorneys
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
um and we thank senator d'alessandro for
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
prime sponsoring this bill and for the
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
sheriff's association for working with
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
us when this bill was introduced by
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro last year
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
we had requested an amendment that went
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
through unanimously
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
that just simply codified what most
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
sheriffs do in practice anyway
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
which is if a sheriff is serving papers
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
at the same location
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
the same address but multiple people are
 
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.110 align:start position:0%
the same address but multiple people are
at

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
that same address that are all being
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
served that the sheriff only charged
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
mileage for that scenario once
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
which is again widespread practice
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
anyway we heard from some of our members
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
you know our attorneys are typically the
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
ones that
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
um utilize um this
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
system for having sheriffs serve papers
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
so this was our request and again we
 
00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:55.839 align:start position:0%
thank the sheriffs for
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
and senator d'alessandro for um being
 
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
amenable to that
 
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
be happy to do my best to answer any
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
questions you may have and thank you all
 
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.269 align:start position:0%
questions you may have and thank you all
again

00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
thank you miss chase has anyone have any
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
seeing none are there any further
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
people with their hands up mickey i see
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
no more uh folks wishing to testify on
 
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman but do you not
 
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
have to open the exact session
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
well that's true is is it your plan to
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
exec because it would be i would be
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
amenable to making a motion
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
well i think it's also proper to
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
introduce the amendment during the
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
public hearing so that
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
people that there can be familiar with
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
it and
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
mickey if you are able to put it on the
 
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:52.320 align:start position:0%

it's in the lba folder i don't know what
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%

okay

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
so this amendment keeps everything in
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
central del alesandro's
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
bill the exact same however it adds
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
lines five through 10 which gives the
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
county delegations and the town county
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
delegations are the ones who control the
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
budgets in the county working with the
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
county commissioners
 
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
the right to vote once annually to
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
increase the fees by the consumer price
 
00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.789 align:start position:0%
increase the fees by the consumer price
index

00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
index
 
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
for the northeast region as published
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
by the bureau of labor statistics the
 
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.510 align:start position:0%
by the bureau of labor statistics the
previous

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
previous
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
june and that's all it does
 
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
um it has been seen in by two counties
 
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
sheriffs in two counties and they were
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
in favor of it as was
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay if you'd uh page down a little bit
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
so that clerk can read the
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
amendment number it's up at the top
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
yep there we go 12
 
00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.750 align:start position:0%
yep there we go 12
12.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
12.
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
okay any questions from the committee
 
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
on the amendment i see uh i see your
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative irf has his hand up
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
representative earth you're recognized
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman when i read line
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
one and maybe
 
00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
i just misunderstand how this was worded
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
but it says amend the bill by replacing
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
all after enacting clause with the
 
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.590 align:start position:0%
all after enacting clause with the
following

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
following
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
yes that's a new paragraph at the bottom
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill where the effective date was
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
that's why line 11 appears effective
 
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
date again
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
and line 11 was modified to say it will
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
take effect
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
60 days after passage because the
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
feedback from the sheriff's
 
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
and the two counties checked was that
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
they could not
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
take effect immediately they had to
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
okay so it's not replacing the entire
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
bill no stating a new paragraph
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
keith line three new paragraph at the
 
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.549 align:start position:0%
keith line three new paragraph at the
bottom

00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
and the paragraph is 12 line
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
five okay
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
i guess we might have to change that
 
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
amend the bill by replacing all after
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
the enacting clause which would take out
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
including the mileage amendment that was
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
previously added
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
about if you got multiple people at the
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
same address you only charge mileage
 
00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.549 align:start position:0%
same address you only charge mileage
once

00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
once
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
and uh i can see removing some of the
 
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.590 align:start position:0%
and uh i can see removing some of the
other

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
fee language but that we probably want
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
anything further
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
all right so representative
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
representative weiler i have a question
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
mary heath
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
all right representative heath for a
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chair
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
my question is um with regard to
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
um we had a statement from marissa chase
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
and also the the sheriff's
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
but this bill if enacted and passed
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
would delay the whole process out at
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
least another year
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
is is am i understanding that correctly
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
by shifting the authority to the
 
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.270 align:start position:0%
by shifting the authority to the
counties

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
we're delaying the process because when
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
that we're in that
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
budget cycle right now and this bill
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
would not be passed
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh within that time frame so could
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
someone just re
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh respond to my comments please
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative ober did you
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
understand the question
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
well mr chairman have we mailed hard
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
copies of the bills to people so they
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
can look at them
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
because as far as i know you can only
 
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
i believe everybody here has has gotten
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
an email copy of 77 as it was introduced
 
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
or the trouble is you can only look at
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
one thing on your screen
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
at a time and did they get hard copies
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
so they can look at them
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
no anybody not have a hard copy that
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
we have some on the table for the people
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
in the room
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
i can see both on my screen together
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
all right sheriff ricciardi had a
 
00:21:50.799 --> 00:21:53.590 align:start position:0%
all right sheriff ricciardi had a
question

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um my question would be
 
00:21:59.270 --> 00:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
if i understand this right the amendment
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
would put the
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
cost back onto the county yeah as far as
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
raising the
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
um like the last representative said
 
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
as far as raising the funds in the
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
county's budget
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
are you saying that the county doesn't
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
but this money is reimbursed by the
 
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.070 align:start position:0%
but this money is reimbursed by the
state

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
okay this is this is a rsa but
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
state so yes the county does raise money
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
it would have been going into effect
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
july 2021
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
so now it is correct that now you're
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
putting it off not just 60 days but
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
unless the county have an emergency
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
meeting to
 
00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
redo the budget you're putting it off
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you further comments
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
from the sheriff's uh
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
yeah yes thank you mr i guess i want to
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that i'm not
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
confused about something are are am i to
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
understand that if we
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
if we pass the bill and pass this
 
00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:23.990 align:start position:0%
if we pass the bill and pass this
amendment

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
that what we would be doing is approving
 
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
the fee increases for
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
now so to speak and then saying that
 
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:34.630 align:start position:0%
now so to speak and then saying that
going

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
forward in future years the the
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
increases could happen
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
sort of on a regular basis so to speak
 
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
if the if the uh
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
if the county convention approved it but
 
00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.269 align:start position:0%
if the county convention approved it but
but

00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
that that for this year the fees that we
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
approve in the
 
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
in the unamended portion of the bill
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
i believe you're correct uh
 
00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:02.559 align:start position:0%
representative lin does anybody
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
mr hawk i mean mr kane because
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
this amendment was done by nancy lavines
 
00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
who unfortunately
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
is not on the call and she was
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
instructed that the intention of the
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
bill was to add
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
the ability of the counties to do that
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
leave the existing
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
fees alone leave the existing mileage
 
00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.789 align:start position:0%
fees alone leave the existing mileage
alone

00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
alone
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
and to change the effective date however
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
without the appropriate
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
lba people on the call i'm not sure why
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
mickey's here without having talked to
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
her but he obviously hadn't even
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
seen the amendment i don't know what to
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
say but i did email mr kane
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
to clarify that mrs lavinas had not made
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
an egregious error here but i don't know
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
well at this time the the um
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
amendment causes confusion by having
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
replacing all after the enacting clause
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
which i don't think is the intent
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
so we we may have to withdraw the
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
maybe for another day and and passed
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
if we pass the bill as it's as it's
 
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
written then it could
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
it could uh we need to have mr kane
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
chime in on this because
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
my county is not willing to have the
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
bill passed as amended
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county has a as
 
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
representative heath knows
 
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
has a serious problem in that we are the
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
only county
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
with two different superior courts
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
with our sheriffs going in two different
 
00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.029 align:start position:0%
with our sheriffs going in two different
ways

00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
ways
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
all the time pulled by court
 
00:25:59.679 --> 00:26:01.190 align:start position:0%
all the time pulled by court
requirements

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
plus adding this on so my county is not
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
in favor of the bill as drafted by
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
senator del alesandro
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
and in fact hadn't even been asked about
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
it they're not opposed to it
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
but without this language they are not
 
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
in favor of having this at all
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't it doesn't give them
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
enough relief this is the first time in
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
11 years
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
these fees have been changed and they're
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
being moved by five dollars
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
i saw i saw that i see the name hoffman
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
i see
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative lin still had his hand up
 
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
did you want to say something further
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
represent lynn
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
no i'm sorry i just forgot to lower my
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
hand but i've done that now sorry about
 
00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:56.549 align:start position:0%
hand but i've done that now sorry about
that

00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative walner for it
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
well she had her hand up and then she
 
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
left all right
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
mike hoffman have you thank you mr chair
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
i wasn't involved in drafting this but i
 
00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.190 align:start position:0%
i wasn't involved in drafting this but i
can

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
get something to or less quickly if the
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
yes we don't want the language that says
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
amend the bill by replacing all after
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
the enacting clause it should say
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
number 10 i get or what's the last
 
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.510 align:start position:0%
number 10 i get or what's the last
paragraph

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:37.039 align:start position:0%
paragraph 9a i think so it should it
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
should probably be
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
10 or no it should be 12.
 
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
although i look down here and it says
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
all after paragraph am i
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
seeing the whole bill here i think so
 
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
so if i understand this is a replace all
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
and that was not the intent
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
we want to add this to the end of the
 
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
existing bill
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
yes that was not the intent i have a
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
series of email exchanges with nancy
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
about this and she says it only adds to
 
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
it so i don't know what is going on
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
because i questioned her and then she
 
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
said she wasn't available this morning
 
00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
so i can look at my email but it doesn't
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
help not having it
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
here the idea was to leave the the bill
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
as it was
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
and to add the ability for the counties
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
once a year to also raise the wages
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
or the fees because as i said
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county has a horrible time
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
with those two
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
superior court houses when only when
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
every other county only has to deal with
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
one of them
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
so i don't know and i i know nancy
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't available today but
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
the other confusion is that um
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
the bill the last roman numeral on the
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
is roman 9 and this is roman 12
 
00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
so what happened to romans 10 and 11. i
 
00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment should be uh number 10
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
roman 10 rather than roman 12
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to amend we want to
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
amend the bill by replacing all after
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
roman nine b
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
so if uh if
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
we can table this discussion for now
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
and come back to it later in this in
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
this meeting
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
then uh that will work out i think if
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
mike hoffman can probably
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
make those changes and bring us a new
 
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
amendment is everyone okay with that
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
well ken we're in public section right
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
now couldn't we just terminate the
 
00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
public hearing on sb 77
 
00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
no i'm gonna uh i'm gonna but we're not
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
in an exact session
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
right so we don't have to table it
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
because we're in a public hearing we
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
okay but i wanted i want to recess the
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
public hearing so i could introduce
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
the amendment in the public hearing
 
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
which is the proper way to do it
 
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
that's different from tabling now i
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
agree with that yes
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
all right we'll recess this discussion
 
00:30:14.159 --> 00:30:14.549 align:start position:0%
all right we'll recess this discussion
on

00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh on senate bill 77 until we see the
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
new amendment
 
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
all right and mike hoffman said he's
 
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
going to he's going to fix those
 
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.750 align:start position:0%
going to he's going to fix those
problems

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.510 align:start position:0%
 
1025

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
we have senate bill we have senate bill
 
00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.149 align:start position:0%
we have senate bill we have senate bill
82

00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
82
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
at 10 25 so we're coming to that a
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
little bit late
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
and that was uh in division two
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
and i'll call upon representative
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
we're still in a public hearing for
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
senate ability to represent weiler
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
we we need to have the public hearing
 
00:30:57.029 --> 00:30:57.039 align:start position:0%
first okay
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
this this will be a public hearing on
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
senate bill 82.
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
um and i have one person signed up to
 
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
speak and that's the prime sponsor uh
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
senator birdsall and she is on the call
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
and is able to be recognized
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
very good all right senator birdsall is
 
00:31:12.159 --> 00:31:13.909 align:start position:0%
very good all right senator birdsall is
right

00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
committee um for hearing senate bill
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
82 this was i am the prime sponsor for
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
which encompasses the towns of derry
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
hampstead in windham
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
and uh senate bill 82 was actually
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
uh holdover from last year it had
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
passed the senate passed the house
 
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
it got caught up in the omnibus bill and
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
assembly i would say the wrong amendment
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
got attached
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
so what senate bill 82 does
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
is correct what the amendment um
 
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
what the omnibus bill did last year
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
basically um this is a result
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
the bill makes whole to those school
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
districts who went from
 
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
part-time kindergarten to full-time and
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
it includes the appropriation for fiscal
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
year 2020 and fiscal year 2021.
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
apparently what happened when we when
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill was put together they they
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
authorized the um they
 
00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
authorized the um
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
process but they didn't make the
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
appropriations so
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
for instance when dairy went to go to
 
00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.110 align:start position:0%
for instance when dairy went to go to
the

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
department of education for their
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation the
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
department of education couldn't
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate it because it wasn't
 
00:32:50.399 --> 00:32:51.509 align:start position:0%
appropriate it because it wasn't
authorized

00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
so senate bill 82 is to correct that um
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
that issue and with that i will
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
um terminate my comments and try and
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
answer any questions i
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
i believe that the department ed may be
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
here as well to
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
kind of go through it as well thank you
 
00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.830 align:start position:0%
kind of go through it as well thank you

for the senator is
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
this bill will this bill
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.870 align:start position:0%
that have um adopted full day
kindergarten

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
kindergarten
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
in the event or are there other towns
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
that have not yet
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
adopted full-time kindergartens so would
 
00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.029 align:start position:0%
adopted full-time kindergartens so would
they

00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
be included in this process if this bill
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
were to pass
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
yes any any of the towns and i i'm sorry
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
i'm having
 
00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:55.519 align:start position:0%
troubles uh scrolling on my
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
um but um it should encompass
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
all of the towns that went from
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
part-time to full-time and i think
 
00:34:02.559 --> 00:34:03.269 align:start position:0%
part-time to full-time and i think
that's

00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
includes chester epsom dairy
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
salem and um there are i think a total
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
and if you look if you look at the bill
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal note i believe it lists all those
 
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.990 align:start position:0%
fiscal note i believe it lists all those
schools

00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%

fiscal note
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%

is this money in the budget that you
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
have presently for this
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
present fiscal year yep um
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question chair uh
 
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
division two put senate bill
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
82 into the budget so it is currently in
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
house bill 2
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
which includes the language from senate
 
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
bill 82 the and the appropriation
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
i did some research this morning looking
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
at schools that potentially are moving
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
to a full day kindergarten for
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 22 and currently no
 
00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:37.990 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 22 and currently no
pro

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
pro
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
no schools at the moment are moving to
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
full day kindergarten so the
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
appropriations you have in the budget at
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
this moment
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
are appropriate and should be enough to
 
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
cover any future expenses
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
as we know them at the moment thank you
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
anything further to add
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
i would make
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
since the money is already included in
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
the in the budget i would make a motion
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
that this bill is
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh should be uh itl
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate second
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
okay a motion from representative lynn
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
for an expedient a second
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
from representative petry further
 
00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:21.910 align:start position:0%
from representative petry further
discussion

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
this was an ito the motion is
 
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion i see representative
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
heath has her hand up
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
now my question is this thank you mr
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
and we end up with a continuing
 
00:41:42.079 --> 00:41:43.430 align:start position:0%
and we end up with a continuing
resolution

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
would that mean that those kindergarten
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
programs would not get this funding
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
well it would also mean that we wouldn't
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
pass the budget if
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
those two things happened uh obviously
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
we if we itl this and the budget does
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
not pass
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
then it could be delayed it's unlikely
 
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
that everything in the budget will be
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
removed but some things will be removed
 
00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.309 align:start position:0%
removed but some things will be removed
and

00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
you know i believe that the finance
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
committee will be aware that of the
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
effect if
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
if this were removed so so mr chair
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
would it be better to retain the bill um
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
until we know that the budget passed i i
 
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
completely agreed with the itl because
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
we did put it in the budget
 
00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
but my my concern right now is in the
 
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
event that the budget doesn't pass
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to leave all these towns
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
without that funding
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm just very concerned about that
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
especially right now
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
should we wait all right so if we do
 
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
retain the bill
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
it won't provide them the uh the funding
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
until next year likely because we'd have
 
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:56.710 align:start position:0%
until next year likely because we'd have
to

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
retain the bill and reintroduce it for
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
next year but
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
at least there would be a chance that it
 
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
would be passed possibly in january by
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah that that's that's a scenario
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
if we if we tabled it we would have to
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
have it out by the deadline
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
it and and we wouldn't know at the
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
deadline whether or not
 
00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
whether or not it had the budget had
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
passed so tabling would wouldn't
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
do much um okay
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
yes uh if i could ask a question of uh
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
mr landergen please
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
go ahead yes uh mickey
 
00:43:54.069 --> 00:43:54.079 align:start position:0%
if we retain this bill
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
we should in fact recommend that the
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
funding go
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
away from the budget because
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
we have put it in because we
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
felt that it was the right thing to do
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
but if we are now going to decide to
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
retain it
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
then that means the funding should not
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
if it's the intent of the committee to
 
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
support these payments to these
 
00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:23.670 align:start position:0%
support these payments to these
districts

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
the fact you've passed in house bill 2
 
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
would provide that
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
that level of funding those
 
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation dollars if you wanted to
 
00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.349 align:start position:0%
appropriation dollars if you wanted to
retain

00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
retain
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
senate bill 82 as a
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
as a backup plan in case something does
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
happen to house bill 2
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
um you wouldn't need to alter the
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
funding in house bill 2 in any way
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i just feel that um
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
in in certainly in my mind there is no
 
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.390 align:start position:0%
in in certainly in my mind there is no
question

00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
that this will be included in the
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
you know the budget doesn't pass
 
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
there'll be
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
lots of things that
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
that aren't there and so i would
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
um i would certainly recommend that we
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
itl it knowing full well when we
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
come to a committee of conference that
 
00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.349 align:start position:0%
come to a committee of conference that
um

00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
this will be um you know one thing that
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
we will
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
insist upon and because it
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
is catching us up from errors that were
 
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%
made by the last legislature
 
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
in 20 and 21. so i
 
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
i think that itl
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
is the right way to go
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
walnut has her hand up thank you
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
um i guess historically i think what
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
we've done
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
is we when we have put things like this
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
we have then retained the bill
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
just in case there is the chance that
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
the budget didn't pass or
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
the particular item was removed from the
 
00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:18.870 align:start position:0%
the particular item was removed from the
budget

00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
no agreement could be made i mean i
 
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
agree that this one i think
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
is pretty safe in the budget but i do
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a back-up plan and then we
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
come back
 
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
in what we've done in the past is these
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
retain bills
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
we've come back in um the fall
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
and um if the budget's passed and if
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
they're there
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
we then have uh moved in expedience it
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
seems like
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
we've stepped we've sort of skipped a
 
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:48.630 align:start position:0%
we've stepped we've sort of skipped a
step

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
step
 
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
um so just
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
if it i guess if it was any if there was
 
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
any chance that it wouldn't
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
be included in the budget and we don't
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
really know that for
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
for sure right now um i would
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
go for retain and then come back in the
 
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:06.630 align:start position:0%
go for retain and then come back in the
fall

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
fall
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
and do inexpedient if
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ober as your
 
00:47:16.079 --> 00:47:17.510 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ober as your
candidate

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman the former chair
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
of finance is correct that there have
 
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:23.589 align:start position:0%
of finance is correct that there have
been

00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
times when we have
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
retained bills in fact i have
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
represented buco's bill
 
00:47:34.549 --> 00:47:34.559 align:start position:0%
retained on water because i was not
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
certain that this year i could put it in
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
and i knew it was a bill that should
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
have been filed in the second year of
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
the biennium not the first year with the
 
00:47:42.079 --> 00:47:42.950 align:start position:0%
the biennium not the first year with the
budget

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
but in two previous occasions when we

knew we were going to put representative
 
00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:48.870 align:start position:0%
knew we were going to put representative

buco's
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
bill in the budget which we

affectionately called the bucco bucks

we did go ahead and itl the bill right

away
 
00:47:58.710 --> 00:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
and the blurb said that it was itl
 
00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.230 align:start position:0%
and the blurb said that it was itl
because

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
the money was going to be in the budget
 
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.520 align:start position:0%

broadband is absolutely an essential
 
00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:33.829 align:start position:0%
broadband is absolutely an essential
commodity

00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
commodity
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
in this day and age when broadband
 
00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
began to be established obviously
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
throughout our state
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's done in a very different model than
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
telephone service was in the past or
 
00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:47.190 align:start position:0%
telephone service was in the past or
electric

00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
electric
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
service was in the past where um
 
00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
universal service was socialized through
 
00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
regulated rates and the entire
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
um spectrum of regulation
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
broadband has been different i would
 
00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:03.349 align:start position:0%
broadband has been different i would
argue

00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
argue
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
that because of its difference we have
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
had a much more
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
innovative and much more cost effective
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
and technology
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
forward-thinking application of the
 
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
installation of broadband
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
but because of um you know the
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
difficulty in some instances of bringing
 
00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:21.430 align:start position:0%
difficulty in some instances of bringing
it

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
to more rural areas of the state there
 
00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:25.349 align:start position:0%
to more rural areas of the state there
are

00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
pockets of new hampshire that do not
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
have broadband
 
00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
so given that
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
there has been an influx of potential
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
federal money i thought it was important
 
00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:39.750 align:start position:0%
federal money i thought it was important
to

00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
introduce senate bill 85 to create a
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
matching grant
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.069 align:start position:0%
program that would utilize this federal
money

00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
matched by either provider dollars or
 
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
local efforts whether it be counties
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities or communication
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
districts to facilitate the
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
um construction of better broadband
 
00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:03.829 align:start position:0%
um construction of better broadband
access

00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
clause it calls on the office of
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
strategic initiatives
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
and i know the representative over has
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
an amendment that i support
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
to if the
 
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal on the department of
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
energy moves forward which you folks
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
um have i think wisely included in your
 
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:30.230 align:start position:0%
um have i think wisely included in your
budget

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
and it's my hope the senate will too but
 
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:33.990 align:start position:0%
and it's my hope the senate will too but
that

00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
um representative ober's amendment would
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
put the department of energy in charge
 
00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
appropriately so of managing the grants
 
00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
there is rule making provided
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
the let me just touch briefly on the
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
way the bill has devised the percentages
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
given that there has been a influx or
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
will be an influx of federal dollars
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
i thought it was appropriate that it be
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
a 50 50 match
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
that could be either state funds or
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
state funds
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
using federal funds for the 50
 
00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:16.799 align:start position:0%
match and then um a process
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
where providers or as i said before
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
municipalities counties or communication
 
00:55:23.839 --> 00:55:24.950 align:start position:0%
municipalities counties or communication
districts

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
would provide the other 50
 
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
of the funding that's um
 
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
basically how it works i think the need
 
00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of amendments that
 
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
added to it and one more amendment that
 
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
myself and senator khan
 
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
will propose for your consideration
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
the planning process for access to these
 
00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.150 align:start position:0%
the planning process for access to these
funds

00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
there is a whole process that goes into
 
00:55:58.960 --> 00:55:59.430 align:start position:0%
there is a whole process that goes into
place

00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
before wires can be strung
 
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
knowing which households need service is
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
an integral part of of that and there
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
are costs involved with planning
 
00:56:14.549 --> 00:56:14.559 align:start position:0%
and then um there was in the initial
 
00:56:14.559 --> 00:56:15.670 align:start position:0%
and then um there was in the initial
version

00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
version
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
of the bill a clause that said
 
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
the upload speed should be uh 25
 
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
and the download speed three the senate
 
00:56:26.559 --> 00:56:27.510 align:start position:0%
and the download speed three the senate
amendment

00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
to language that said promotes a faster
 
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
service up and including to a gigabyte
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
of service
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
um let me just touch mr chairman on the
 
00:56:38.319 --> 00:56:39.910 align:start position:0%
um let me just touch mr chairman on the
amendment

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
the amendment makes it clear that
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
any um construction that was
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
um undertaken as of january uh
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
one of this year shall be eligible for
 
00:56:52.799 --> 00:56:53.750 align:start position:0%
one of this year shall be eligible for
funding

00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
um some of us have heard that some towns
 
00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:56.789 align:start position:0%
um some of us have heard that some towns
are

00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
holding off on planning or proceeding
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
hoping to get this grant funding this
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
makes sure that they can move forward
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
while knowing that the grants will be
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
there so
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions and thank
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you senator
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
we have a question from representative
 
00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:17.589 align:start position:0%
we have a question from representative
edwards

00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
edwards
 
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and i i have two
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
questions that are related for senator
 
00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:23.190 align:start position:0%
questions that are related for senator
bradley

00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
bradley
 
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh if i may the the first one is
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
um i i understand the appeal
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
of uh of having faster uh connectivity
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
than the uh the minimum set by the
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
with the 25 and the three going up to a
 
00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:41.510 align:start position:0%
with the 25 and the three going up to a
gig

00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
gig
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
instead i get it um but when we do that
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
don't we uh lose the matching
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
part of this and and we have created
 
00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:52.230 align:start position:0%
part of this and and we have created
effectively

00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
00:57:54.309 --> 00:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
our own program where we have to go it
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
alone because
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
their standards are so much lower than
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
ours i do not believe that that's the
 
00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.270 align:start position:0%
ours i do not believe that that's the
case

00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
um i mean i i could be
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
corrected if i'm wrong but we never
 
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
heard representative that kind of
 
00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:09.990 align:start position:0%
heard representative that kind of
testimony

00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
from any of the experts um from any of
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
the cable providers
 
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
um or any of the public if that's the
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
case then
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
we might have to make a change but i
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
don't believe it is ask that question
 
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
of some of the folks that will follow me
 
00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:26.710 align:start position:0%
of some of the folks that will follow me
though

00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you very much i i i do
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
think it's a concern we're looking at
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
the the broadband issue in auburn so
 
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
i've i've read the language and
 
00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
it just is a concern of mine sort of the
 
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
the the other
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
is um we the current law that we've set
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
this up on i understand
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
has the municipality or the
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
communications network
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
issue a bond and then that bond gets
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
paid back
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh over 20 years would this matching
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
fund with the state monies
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
also be paid back over 20 years because
 
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
of the municipal bond
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
um so the way that this is structured to
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
work representative is that it'd be a 50
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
50 cost share so the state obviously
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
would take the lead but using especially
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
right now is there is going to be
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of federal funding for 50 of the
 
00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:24.549 align:start position:0%
a lot of federal funding for 50 of the
cost

00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
i have felt that there should be
 
00:59:27.119 --> 00:59:28.150 align:start position:0%
i have felt that there should be
participation

00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
participation
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
by whether it's a town a county or the
 
00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.829 align:start position:0%
by whether it's a town a county or the
providers

00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
to move forward with you know getting
 
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
this kind of a grant
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
there is a bonding provision that
 
00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:42.230 align:start position:0%
there is a bonding provision that
municipalities

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
can go forward with bonding that
 
00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
was part of senator khan's bill senate
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
bill 170
 
00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
that was passed i don't know three or
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
four years ago probably
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
i don't think that would affect how a
 
00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.349 align:start position:0%
i don't think that would affect how a
municipality

00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
chose to finance if they chose to
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
finance it
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
through a bond hopefully with the you
 
01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:05.349 align:start position:0%
through a bond hopefully with the you
know

01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
kind of dollars that we're talking about
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
those kind of municipal bondings can
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
would not be favored but it my
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
understanding is it would remain an
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
option thank you senator i i
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
i support the initiative i i'm just
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
curious about the details thank you for
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
your time yeah you're welcome thank you
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%

01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman
 
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
good morning senator bradley good
 
01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.510 align:start position:0%
good morning senator bradley good
morning

01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for working with me on the
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
amendment we have to ensure that
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
even if osi goes away in the budget that
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
we can continue this program
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
i think i heard you say and i got
 
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
something from your assistant not too
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
long ago we'd already started this
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
meeting about
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
a an amendment that senator khan had
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
in the house we only have one amendment
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
per bill i don't know how the senate
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
does it
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm a little concerned about
 
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
whether with the amendment i have
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
because i didn't know anything about
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
senator khan's amendment until your
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
assistant sent it to me this morning
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
how we would proceed with this bill
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
so um representative ober i think if you
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
look at page two of the bill
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
um on line three
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
establishment of a challenge process
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
so senator khan and i are proposing and
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
you can fold this into your amendment
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
representative ober would be fine
 
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
that would it would just say projects in
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
in the in planning designer terms
 
01:01:48.559 --> 01:01:49.910 align:start position:0%
in the in planning designer terms
negotiations

01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
and not under construction as of january
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
1 2021
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
shall be eligible for funding so it's it
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
really is nothing more than
 
01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
um allowing um
 
01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
a process that had already started that
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
had not started construction
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
because some towns are waiting to be
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
eligible for the bonds and that would go
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
um at the end of line six on page
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
two okay my second question if you would
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
take a second question
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
yep we are we've
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
been working and i know you and
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
chairman weiler and i and others have
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
been working with the governor
 
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
about the ara funds which we hope
 
01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:37.039 align:start position:0%
to have in state at some point time and
 
01:02:37.039 --> 01:02:37.349 align:start position:0%
to have in state at some point time and
i

01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
think this would be part of that funding
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
yet i believe that part of the guidance
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
we've gotten
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
in the bill although we haven't gotten
 
01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
guidance per se
 
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
written guidance other than what was in
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
revolved around the fact that you could
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
not use that money
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
to replace existing spending
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
will this impact that and if it does
 
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
how would it impact it would we be
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
replacing existing
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
spending of some sort so
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding representative is this
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
would all be new
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
spending um similar to
 
01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
you know what the gopher committee and
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
the governor proposed last summer
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately because of the time
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
the very
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
very tight timelines uh very little of
 
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
the money could be
 
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
uh used this would be
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
it would not be replacing of existing
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
spending but it would be
 
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
this would be new spending on
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and as you know
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
um in the legislation the past congress
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
um infrastructure spending like water
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
roads and
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
and broadband was highlighted as a
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
allowable use certainly that was my
 
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.109 align:start position:0%
allowable use certainly that was my
understanding

01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
of how that federal legislation works
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
any further questions for senator
 
01:04:10.839 --> 01:04:13.109 align:start position:0%

he has been attentive to the testimony
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's been received
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%

led the way for a 24 to nothing vote on
 
01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:25.670 align:start position:0%
led the way for a 24 to nothing vote on
this

01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
in the senate uh and i'm pleased to be
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
here to
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
to speak on its behalf um
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
since senate bill 170 was passed in 2018
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
there have been seven projects completed
 
01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:41.270 align:start position:0%
there have been seven projects completed
in

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
the state with municipal funding it's a
 
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
real stretch on communities
 
01:05:50.549 --> 01:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
to do this seven have used exclusively
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
the bonding uh
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
authority and uh i believe it was five
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
other projects
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh worked their way through
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh the latest uh round of
 
01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
cares money that was allocated by the
 
01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.750 align:start position:0%
cares money that was allocated by the
governor

01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
to towns or providers
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
to improve services at least
 
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
to the minimum standards established by
 
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
the fcc
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
um so we
 
01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
uh now come to uh the implementation
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
of uh senate bill 85 hopefully uh
 
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
and as we look forward to that uh we've
 
01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:29.510 align:start position:0%
and as we look forward to that uh we've
got

01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
quite a lineup of projects that
 
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
hit the queue this last winter and
 
01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.549 align:start position:0%
hit the queue this last winter and
spring

01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
spring
 
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
since january 1st of 2021
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
with warrant articles going before towns
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
some of which have been passed
 
01:06:49.349 --> 01:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
some of which are still pending so there
 
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
are uh as of uh current
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
at least 15 projects that i'm aware of
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
that are in the queue nine of those the
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
warrant articles have
 
01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
already been adopted by towns
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh and then the other six are still in
 
01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:09.589 align:start position:0%
uh and then the other six are still in
process

01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
um and of those nine
 
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
projects they are in four different
 
01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:16.390 align:start position:0%
projects they are in four different
counties

01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
counties
 
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
so it's not like it's just localized in
 
01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:19.589 align:start position:0%
so it's not like it's just localized in
uh

01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh towns in cheshire county though uh
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
there are many
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh in in my district that have either
 
01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
used it or
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
planned to use it in the in the future
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
i mean these are spread into merrimack
 
01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:34.950 align:start position:0%
i mean these are spread into merrimack
and

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
and hillsborough and sullivan counties
 
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
uh and i know senator bradley is working
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh in in his
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
areas of the state that uh are
 
01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.109 align:start position:0%
areas of the state that uh are
interested

01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
interested
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
in uh taking advantage of a broadband
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
match project
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
uh fund and its availability uh
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
so where we are currently is that these
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
projects are not
 
01:08:03.029 --> 01:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
following through uh to uh
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
to signing of contracts and bonding
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh because they really do want to be
 
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
eligible for
 
01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
the matching grants it can make a huge
 
01:08:13.119 --> 01:08:13.829 align:start position:0%
the matching grants it can make a huge
difference

01:08:13.829 --> 01:08:13.839 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
many of these towns in my area that i'm
 
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
uh there's like 700 people uh in the
 
01:08:20.239 --> 01:08:21.269 align:start position:0%
uh there's like 700 people uh in the
towns

01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
so uh they are not have a
 
01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
great investments for a provider
 
01:08:27.759 --> 01:08:29.749 align:start position:0%
great investments for a provider
necessarily

01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
they cover wide areas but small
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
service populations this is why the
 
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
matching grant
 
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
becomes so important if we are going to
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
really try to lead the way
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
and make sure that households are not
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
left behind
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
and we've all heard the stories about
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
the households left behind
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
the towns are really looking at their
 
01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.110 align:start position:0%
the towns are really looking at their
survival

01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
survival
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh because if if somebody
 
01:08:59.829 --> 01:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
can't uh uh connect to the internet
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's just a a stopper as far as
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh people uh want it's it's depressing
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
home values property values
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh keeping people from starting
 
01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:12.550 align:start position:0%
uh keeping people from starting
businesses

01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
in uh smaller towns and communities
 
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
around the state so
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
in order to level the playing field uh
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
this this grant program is really
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
important and i
 
01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh to to representative ober's uh
 
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
question i'm sure that we can take this
 
01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:27.590 align:start position:0%
question i'm sure that we can take this
one-line

01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
one-line
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%

have worked on
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh that would make projects eligible uh
 
01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
if they uh are in the planning stage and
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
not yet under construction as of january
 
01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.110 align:start position:0%

thank you for your words as you know
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
senator bradley said i had an amendment
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
that he had already approved
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
have you started working on a joint
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
amendment that uses both of those
 
01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:23.750 align:start position:0%
amendment that uses both of those
languages

01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
languages
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
because we were intending to work on
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
this bill this morning and this
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
is totally unknown to me until
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
senator bradley's secretary was kind
 
01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
enough to
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
email me a copy but we'd already started
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
here so have you taken the first steps
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
to make that joint amendment
 
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
i have not and i was unaware of
 
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
your amendment but um if you can allow
 
01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:52.229 align:start position:0%
your amendment but um if you can allow
us

01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
a day here i i'm sure that we would
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
further representative ober
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
i guess i would like to know if the
 
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
senate can then
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
amend this bill on their side on a bill
 
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
that they have
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
because i think we're ready to move
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
forward this morning
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
and this was unknown but i believe the
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
senate still has
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
bills that they could use to to make
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment happy
 
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
can that be done senator khan so you
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
guys can work on this since
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
nothing's been done on a joint amendment
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:42.630 align:start position:0%
um i
 
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:44.310 align:start position:0%
um i
[Music]

01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
know that they are here on the
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
on the senate side i'm not i don't serve
 
01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.110 align:start position:0%
on the senate side i'm not i don't serve
on

01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh election law and municipal
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
affairs i i would guess it would
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
most likely be on a bill there but i i
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
don't know what's left on their docket
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
anything further represented over no i'm
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
just going to check and see if jeb might
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
still be online
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
okay representative edwards for a
 
01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:20.229 align:start position:0%
okay representative edwards for a
question

01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh good talking to
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
you again senator khan
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
i i i i assume you heard the uh the two
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
questions i
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
asked senator bradley i i'll just focus
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
on the first one which is
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
given that the federal standard is a
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
25 download and three upload
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
and we're at a gig if the town
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
applies for this and they're say at a
 
01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:47.590 align:start position:0%
applies for this and they're say at a
100

01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
100
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
upload and download or vice versa rather
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
do do they qualify still for the federal
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
grant or
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
or are we really no longer matching
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
we're we're taking over the program
 
01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:02.950 align:start position:0%
we're we're taking over the program
because

01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
they exceed the federal standard do you
 
01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:06.470 align:start position:0%
they exceed the federal standard do you
know

01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
sir yep yeah i i guess i'd i'd uh i'll
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
take that question representative
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh and and offer two perspectives one
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
is a town currently can can set
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
a in their rfp a standard that's above
 
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
the fcc minimum
 
01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
they can't bar anybody from applying
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
but they can set a higher criteria
 
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
so if if a proposal is 25 by 3
 
01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
from an existing provider then then
 
01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
that's an eligible uh response to be
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
considered by a town
 
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
but a town can uh elect to not
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh accept any rfp
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh that is below the standard that they
 
01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:57.510 align:start position:0%
uh that is below the standard that they
set

01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
set
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
in the rfp so a town could set a higher
 
01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:01.350 align:start position:0%
in the rfp so a town could set a higher
standard

01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
standard
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
that it wishes to have for those
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
unserved areas
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
rsa-333 describes the rfp
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
process so that that number one number
 
01:14:18.719 --> 01:14:19.189 align:start position:0%
process so that that number one number
two

01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
i think i think you could uh and i think
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
the senate bill 85 allows
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
for a standard to be
 
01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
set for the grant funding that
 
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
could exceed the the minimum
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
of 25 3. i think the grant standard
 
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
and the statute don't need to parallel
 
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
anything further representative edwards
 
01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:50.149 align:start position:0%
anything further representative edwards
uh

01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
yes sir i don't think i was really clear
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
on my example what i was trying to do is
 
01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:55.110 align:start position:0%
on my example what i was trying to do is
to

01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
pick the scenario where the town may
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
already exceed the federal standard but
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
it's still really
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
poor bandwidth and our standard of
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
at a gig is higher and so the
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
municipality is in an in between state
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
between the federal standard and our
 
01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.070 align:start position:0%
between the federal standard and our
standard

01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
standard
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm just curious if we know
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
um at that point the federal program
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
is even applicable and the state is
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
subsidizing the whole of the investment
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
and not
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
matching but replacing i
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
i hear the question uh now uh
 
01:15:39.189 --> 01:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for clarifying
 
01:15:39.199 --> 01:15:41.030 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for clarifying
uh

01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
um that would be a served community
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
and uh and and the residents of that
 
01:15:52.229 --> 01:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh community that had a 25 megabytes
 
01:15:52.239 --> 01:15:52.950 align:start position:0%
uh community that had a 25 megabytes
down

01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
and three megabyte up service
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
that would be a served uh
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
household or business
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you all right i think senator
 
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
bradley is waiting to give
 
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
some further answers to some earlier
 
01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.750 align:start position:0%
some further answers to some earlier
questions

01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
senator bradley uh yes
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
i think representative ober had a
 
01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.310 align:start position:0%
i think representative ober had a
question

01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
um i'm also trying to
 
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
testify on another bill in uh another
 
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
house committee so
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
i was going back and forth and i didn't
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
hear a question oh jeb i'm sorry i asked
 
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
said since i you're i would like to say
 
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
your executive assistant
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
sent me senator khan's amendment this
 
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
morning after we had already started our
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
hearing at 10 o'clock and i appreciated
 
01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:47.189 align:start position:0%
hearing at 10 o'clock and i appreciated
that

01:16:47.189 --> 01:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
i asked senator khan since you had a
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
copy of my
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
amendment already if he had already
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
taken the steps to go to ols and say can
 
01:16:58.229 --> 01:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
we have a combined amendment with this
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
because we're going to move this morning
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
and we only have
 
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
we don't have two hearings posted and he
 
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
said no
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
my second question was was there another
 
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
bill in the senate that his amendment
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
could be attached to to modify this and
 
01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
he didn't know and since i've been since
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
i asked that i've been sitting here
 
01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
wondering to myself
 
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
if that's a piece we could add to the
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
during the committee of conference on
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
the budget or if gary daniels could add
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
that now
 
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
so i was trying to find a way to
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
incorporate that we could still go ahead
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
your thoughts yeah so representative
 
01:17:38.159 --> 01:17:39.189 align:start position:0%
your thoughts yeah so representative
ober

01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
ober
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
if you want us to um take action
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
in another setting whether it's hb2 or
 
01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
another bill
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
on the amendment that senator khan and i
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
are sponsoring together
 
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
we can accommodate that if that makes
 
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
your life easier
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%

nordgren um this is just a process
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
question it appears that we have
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
issues in divisions one and two
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
with bills that we're hearing today that
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
normally would have gone back to the
 
01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
division so they could work
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
on them further division three is doing
 
01:18:55.679 --> 01:18:56.310 align:start position:0%
on them further division three is doing
that

01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:58.630 --> 01:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
this afternoon at one o'clock with the
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
bills we have
 
01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
i just think we're trying to do too much
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
in one day
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
and finish up things when maybe we need
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
more time
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
and let the divisions carry on their
 
01:19:11.189 --> 01:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
usual work
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
that's just my comment thank you thank
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%

01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
not sure whether we will have that
 
01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:18.550 align:start position:0%
not sure whether we will have that
division

01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
session this afternoon or not i don't
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%

testifying in support of the need of
 
01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
senate bill 85
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
establishing matching funds for local
 
01:20:26.239 --> 01:20:28.390 align:start position:0%
establishing matching funds for local
municipalities

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
years ago before the pandemic i can tell
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
you that i connected with realtors
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and i
 
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
personally was naive about the number of
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
homes in our state that do not have
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
access to reliable internet
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
and that was all like i said pre-covered
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
access to fast reliable service is no
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
longer an added benefit to a home but
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
much as a necessity senator bradley
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
talked about online schooling
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
telemedicine and work from home
 
01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.310 align:start position:0%
telemedicine and work from home
requirements

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:20:58.629 --> 01:20:58.639 align:start position:0%
clearly everything is very very
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
important to home buyers today
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's not an exaggeration that high-speed
 
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.270 align:start position:0%
it's not an exaggeration that high-speed
broadband

01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
broadband
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
is now becoming as essential as water
 
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
electricity and other things that we
 
01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:11.350 align:start position:0%
electricity and other things that we
consider

01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
required utilities to make a home
 
01:21:14.239 --> 01:21:16.310 align:start position:0%
required utilities to make a home
operate

01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
operate
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
and i believe that fast reliable
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
internet really helps our communities
 
01:21:20.239 --> 01:21:21.750 align:start position:0%
internet really helps our communities
prosper

01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
prosper
 
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
there was a department of commerce study
 
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
that concluded high-speed internet
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
access increased property values six
 
01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.149 align:start position:0%
access increased property values six
percent

01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh this obviously helps our local
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
municipals municipalities
 
01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
achieve a higher tax base as well
 
01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
and it's not just on the residential
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
side i personally work on the commercial
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
side of the industry
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that it's one of the
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
first questions that
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
users of space ask me and now in
 
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.110 align:start position:0%

gigabit speeds throughout their networks
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
we are here today to testify in support
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
of senate bill 85.
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's challenges relative to
 
01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
broadband are not
 
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
unique to rural states however
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
with the forthcoming influx of federal
 
01:23:33.199 --> 01:23:34.470 align:start position:0%
with the forthcoming influx of federal
dollars

01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
that we see on the horizon we believe
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire is well positioned
 
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
to help close the connectivity gap and
 
01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:41.189 align:start position:0%
to help close the connectivity gap and
this

01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation we believe to be
 
01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:44.229 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation we believe to be
critical

01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
critical
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
in that process nectar endorses
 
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
public-private partnerships
 
01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
that are technology and provider neutral
 
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
to solve the challenge of how best to
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
bring broadband
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
to parts of the state that currently
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
lack access
 
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
and that is the approach that this bill
 
01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:03.990 align:start position:0%
and that is the approach that this bill
takes

01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
takes
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
furthermore senate bill 85 includes key
 
01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
safeguards to ensure that public
 
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
dollars are invested in areas where they
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
are truly
 
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
needed to connect unserved populations
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
in an efficient sustainable and
 
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
the programs envisioned by senate bill
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
85 will attract we believe
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
a broad range of internet service
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
providers capable of building
 
01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:32.310 align:start position:0%
providers capable of building
sustainable

01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
sustainable
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
high-speed networks in the most
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
cost-efficient manner
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
using public-private partnerships will
 
01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
leverage private sector dollars
 
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
and expertise to get the most out of
 
01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:43.350 align:start position:0%
and expertise to get the most out of
available

01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%

amount
 
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
of funds available to solve the
 
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
remaining connectivity gaps
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire senate bill 85
 
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
correctly allocates dollars to projects
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
that do not have alternative funding
 
01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:00.470 align:start position:0%
that do not have alternative funding
available

01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
or would not be completed without this
 
01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
program's assistance
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
necta understands the urgent need to
 
01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
serve currently unserved areas in new
 
01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:11.510 align:start position:0%
serve currently unserved areas in new
hampshire

01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
and we believe that this is the best
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
pathway forward to achieve this goal
 
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
and we stand ready to partner with the
 
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
state and municipalities in new
 
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire to do so
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
with that i'm happy to answer questions
 
01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:26.470 align:start position:0%
with that i'm happy to answer questions
um

01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to just touch on
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
senator edwards question that he
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
asked senator
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative edwards rather
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
i would stress that that this is an
 
01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:42.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity to serve
 
01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
unserved areas and so a higher
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
standard of up to a gigabit
 
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
would not preclude any municipality or
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh communications district or county
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
from pursuing
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
participation in this program um
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
but those dollars allocated
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
through this uh program would
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
remain focused on unserved areas
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
in whatever the municipality saw to be
 
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
the best
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any of the
 
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you miss weston
 
01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
andrea how many people do we have that
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
want to speak to us
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
we have john pascarelli who had
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
previously expressed interest
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
to speak so i can bring him in any after
 
01:26:38.639 --> 01:26:39.830 align:start position:0%
to speak so i can bring him in any after
him

01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
him
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
i do not see any other hands raised at
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
this time but i will ask
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
that anyone who does want to speak that
 
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
they raise their hand at this time
 
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
all right and i would also ask that if
 
01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
if we've heard
 
01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
some of the same testimony that's
 
01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
somewhat uh repetitious i'd ask if any
 
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
have anything new to add that they would
 
01:26:58.629 --> 01:26:58.639 align:start position:0%
come on but if it's
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
if it's more or less to say the same
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
thing then uh
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
just to say they support the bill would
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
be fine thank you
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
mr pascarelli welcome back
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
hello senators how are we doing today
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
well we're also mostly representatives
 
01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:32.229 align:start position:0%
well we're also mostly representatives
here

01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
okay mostly representatives um
 
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
after listening to all of you folks's
 
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
you know in-depth conversation
 
01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
i came to a few conclusions one
 
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
conclusion is that you came up with a
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
federal standard
 
01:27:50.310 --> 01:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
you know of 25 down and three up
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
um just so that you folks have some
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
valuable information
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
you know to toss around this is a dsl
 
01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
line that i'm currently on
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
which is a three megabyte dsl
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
that i'm trying to operate you know
 
01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:10.719 align:start position:0%
the music industry and it's almost
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
virtually impossible
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
and i guess my biggest question is
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
are some of you representatives gonna
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
try to introduce a bill
 
01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
that's gonna allow some of this funding
 
01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
to go above your federal standard
 
01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:29.510 align:start position:0%
to go above your federal standard
because

01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
i think the federal standard is what i'm
 
01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.470 align:start position:0%
i think the federal standard is what i'm
on

01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
which you folks have already talked
 
01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
about is
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
way way too low i mean if you're gonna
 
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
be reaching out into these rural areas
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
like i am out here in swansea
 
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
you know and i'm on a old-fashioned
 
01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.550 align:start position:0%
you know and i'm on a old-fashioned
analog

01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
analog
 
01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
converted digital line to be here on the
 
01:28:55.199 --> 01:28:56.550 align:start position:0%
converted digital line to be here on the
internet

01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
internet
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
you know that you know stan that federal
 
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
standard that you folks are talking
 
01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:02.790 align:start position:0%
standard that you folks are talking
about

01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:29:05.669 --> 01:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
would be just ridiculous to serve the
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
customers in the state of new hampshire
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
and i've also been attending a lot of
 
01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:11.990 align:start position:0%
and i've also been attending a lot of
the

01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
zoom meetings with south region
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
southwest regional planning committee
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
i've been
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
voicing my voice you know with that with
 
01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:22.719 align:start position:0%
the planning council
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
bring it to the forefront you know that
 
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
if you're talking about a copper wire
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
which would even
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
include a cable company copper wire has
 
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
its limitations of speeds
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
granted it's a choice
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's better than what i'm using
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
but we have fiber optic
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
networking out here in these telephone
 
01:29:54.159 --> 01:29:55.350 align:start position:0%
networking out here in these telephone
poles

01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
poles
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
which is the severe superior
 
01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
source of internet in my opinion
 
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
and i think that there should be some
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
some of you representatives that should
 
01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:08.719 align:start position:0%
be pushing
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know to increase that
 
01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
federal standard now i realize that
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the state of new
 
01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire and we're talking about the
 
01:30:16.239 --> 01:30:17.270 align:start position:0%
hampshire and we're talking about the
feds

01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
feds
 
01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
but i mean i think it should be part of
 
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
you folks is process
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
that when they try to apply for some of
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
this funding
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
that like for example i'm on three
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
megabyte i don't want to be disqualified
 
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
for better internet because i already
 
01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
got three megabytes i don't want to be
 
01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:36.790 align:start position:0%
got three megabytes i don't want to be
disqualified

01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
disqualified
 
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
because i got three megabytes i don't
 
01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
think that'd be fair
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
so i think this should be some sort of
 
01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:44.229 align:start position:0%
so i think this should be some sort of
terminology

01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
terminology
 
01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
you know to put in there somewhere that
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
if people are going to be upgrading
 
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
their broadband they should be upgrading
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
and spending the money wisely to get the
 
01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
best they possibly could get
 
01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
and just to throw another piece in there
 
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
i've been working with consolidated you
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
know and me as just a plain
 
01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
joe resident out here
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
on my little piece of land if i want to
 
01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:11.990 align:start position:0%
on my little piece of land if i want to
get

01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
this broadband service brought to my
 
01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:15.189 align:start position:0%
this broadband service brought to my
home

01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
the quote that i was quoted was five
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars it's gonna cost me five
 
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
to get broadband at my home and you know
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
i think if you get a chance to speak
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
with some residents
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
folks aren't going to be able to afford
 
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
that not only that but
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
i'm in the town of swansea the town of
 
01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:36.790 align:start position:0%
i'm in the town of swansea the town of
swansea

01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
swansea
 
01:31:39.669 --> 01:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
they can't afford it either so i mean i
 
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
think we're going to run into some
 
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
roadblocks but
 
01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
i wanted a chance to support you guys's
 
01:31:47.189 --> 01:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
bill i support it
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
i wanted a chance to reach out to
 
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
representatives like a large group like
 
01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:52.550 align:start position:0%
representatives like a large group like
this

01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
and give you my feedback as a plain jane
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
resident out here in the field what i'm
 
01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:00.629 align:start position:0%
resident out here in the field what i'm
experiencing

01:32:00.629 --> 01:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
experiencing
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's it i support the bill
 
01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr pascarelli i think we had
 
01:32:07.590 --> 01:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
some testimony that
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
it would uh it would not be restricted
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
to that
 
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
that um federal standard that it would
 
01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:15.430 align:start position:0%
that um federal standard that it would
likely

01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
likely
 
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
whatever the the area was requesting
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
would be supported i believe that was
 
01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
the case but
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
whether we had to go further and to put
 
01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
into uh
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
into uh another type of cable i'm not
 
01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
sure whether that's in it or not but
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
we'll find out later as
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
as we go we still don't know all the
 
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
rules on the
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
money that's going to be available and
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
we're waiting and waiting
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
to find out so when we do find out if
 
01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
it's needed to go to a higher standard
 
01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
then i'm sure that there will be
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
legislation submitted but it won't be
 
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
take effect right away thank you
 
01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:04.629 --> 01:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you sir thank you
 
01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh andrea is there anybody else that it
 
01:33:10.629 --> 01:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh we have a lisa steadman
 
01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
who is raise their hand if we can bring
 
01:33:25.110 --> 01:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
hi thank you very much i'm lisa steadman
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
from troy new hampshire that's also in
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
the monadnock region
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
i'm serving on our broadband committee
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
there and we're in that camp of
 
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
that group of towns that have proposed
 
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
to form a private and public partnership
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
with consolidated communications
 
01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
i think there's some feeling that we've
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
lost some opportunity
 
01:33:47.110 --> 01:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
by moving too fast that perhaps this
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
grant can't benefit
 
01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
us because we already have a partnership
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
proposed with consolidated in in our
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
partnership we're going to have a
 
01:33:55.679 --> 01:33:56.550 align:start position:0%
partnership we're going to have a
20-year

01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
20-year
 
01:33:59.430 --> 01:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
municipal bond they're going to pay for
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
the bond so it's not really a cost to
 
01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
our town
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
but the folks who do sign up for the
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
consolidated service will pay a user fee
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
of 9.50 per month until the bond is paid
 
01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:11.669 align:start position:0%
of 9.50 per month until the bond is paid
off

01:34:11.669 --> 01:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
so it's not exactly free to the people
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
who want to take advantage of the
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
high-speed internet that's coming to our
 
01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:19.030 align:start position:0%
high-speed internet that's coming to our
town

01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
i think that the committee and others
 
01:34:23.110 --> 01:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
are interested in knowing whether this
 
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
matching grant could help to benefit our
 
01:34:25.679 --> 01:34:26.550 align:start position:0%
matching grant could help to benefit our
town

01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
by reducing the end user fee that's
 
01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:31.270 align:start position:0%
by reducing the end user fee that's
being

01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
brought on by consolidated
 
01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
communications and we're just not clear
 
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
about whether the grant funds can be
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am are there any questions
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
on miss stedman's testimony
 
01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:00.159 align:start position:0%
andrew is anyone further on this bill we
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
do have a tom bascom
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um so i'm
 
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm in greenfield uh where we also like
 
01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:20.070 align:start position:0%
i'm in greenfield uh where we also like
troy

01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
troy
 
01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
have a project that has been approved
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
and we're concerned about the timing uh
 
01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
whether or not our project could qualify
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
for this funding the uh amendment that
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
senator bradley and senator khan are
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
proposing is is very important to us
 
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
that would that would certainly make a
 
01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:41.679 align:start position:0%
big difference to
 
01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
our cost structure because if we can get
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
matching funds
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
then we should be able to reduce the
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
bond amount
 
01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
by you know half
 
01:35:53.189 --> 01:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
which would make a significant
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
difference to the
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
subscribers in town we're also concerned
 
01:35:59.590 --> 01:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
about the overall timing and the
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
you know how long this is going to take
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
to get a decision
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
from osi or whoever ends up
 
01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
putting together that process so we
 
01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
would encourage
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
uh the committee to establish
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
aggressive timelines and to pass senator
 
01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
bradley and senator khan's
 
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
amendment so that the towns may fully
 
01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:23.189 align:start position:0%
amendment so that the towns may fully
participate

01:36:23.189 --> 01:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
participate
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
in in this process thank you mr baskin
 
01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on mr baskin's
 
01:36:29.119 --> 01:36:31.270 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on mr baskin's
testimony

01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%

senator bradley said he and i were
concerned

01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
we both support the bill the bill takes
 
01:37:43.590 --> 01:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
effect july 1st this does not change
 
01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:44.149 align:start position:0%
effect july 1st this does not change
that

01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
but on july 1st the office of strategic
 
01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
initiatives which is named in the bill
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
would cease to exist and the department
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
of energy would take over
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
so this amendment has contingency
 
01:37:56.159 --> 01:37:57.350 align:start position:0%
so this amendment has contingency
language

01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
should the budget be vetoed
 
01:38:04.149 --> 01:38:04.159 align:start position:0%
the office of strategic initiatives
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
remains in this bill
 
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
should the budget pass the duties of the
 
01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
office of strategic initiatives
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
will pass to the department of of energy
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
so that there is no lapse in our ability
 
01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
to move forward with these important
 
01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:23.590 align:start position:0%

grants

01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:23.600 align:start position:0%

01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
amendment he and i worked on it together
 
01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
before it was drafted
 
01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
we felt we needed the contingency work
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
and i thank senator bradley for working
 
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:38.560 align:start position:0%

will pass on another bill so
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative emerick is recognized for
 
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:45.760 align:start position:0%

01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
yes this uh amends the bill
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
by adding a section at the end pushing
 
01:44:05.350 --> 01:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
the effective
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
date down to section three so it
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
retains the text of senate bill 77 as it
 
01:44:13.189 --> 01:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
came to you
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
but adds this paragraph in
 
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
existing statute there is a paragraph
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh roman numeral 11 so that's why it
 
01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
looks like it's skipping over but it's
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:32.840 align:start position:0%

01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
that is the sum of everything all the
 
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
incentives match admin marketing and
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
federal snap dollars being spent
 
01:54:08.229 --> 01:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
and kept in the granite state that is
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
the amount that these programs will help
 
01:54:12.390 --> 01:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
infuse into the new hampshire economy
 
01:54:14.790 --> 01:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
over the next two years
 
01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
that 10 million 196 837 dollars is being
 
01:54:20.550 --> 01:54:20.560 align:start position:0%

markets and co-ops
 
01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
instead of big box and super stores
 
01:54:28.149 --> 01:54:28.159 align:start position:0%
these independent stores are more
 
01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
neighborhood focused they support their
 
01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
local communities
 
01:54:33.990 --> 01:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
and they pay their workers a living wage
 
01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
produce from that 10
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%

california or mexico
 
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:46.320 align:start position:0%

01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
additional workers upgrade equipment and
 
01:54:50.070 --> 01:54:50.080 align:start position:0%

double up food bucks

in the state
 
01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
we're very excited because this is a
 
01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
natural extension of our programming
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
our nutrition programming is really
 
01:56:22.070 --> 01:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
geared at
 
01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
bringing more nutritious foods to our
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire food insecure
 
01:56:28.870 --> 01:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
it helpfully hopefully positively impact
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
their health and lower our overall
 
01:56:32.550 --> 01:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
health care costs in the state
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
but this program is part of our snap
 
01:56:36.070 --> 01:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
outreach we are one of the only snap
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
outreach programs in the state
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
that's where we help folks who want to
 
01:56:42.070 --> 01:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
sign up for snap incentives otherwise
 
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
formally known as food stamps we also
 
01:56:45.990 --> 01:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
run a cooking matters program
 
01:56:48.070 --> 01:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
that's nutrition education for families
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
individuals and children
 
01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
where they learn how to cook on a budget
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
unit pricing
 
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
stretch their dollar and really get more
 
01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
from what they purchase at the grocery
 
01:56:57.280 --> 01:56:58.070 align:start position:0%
from what they purchase at the grocery
store

01:56:58.070 --> 01:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
store
 
01:56:59.589 --> 01:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
this is an example behind us of what
 
01:57:01.270 --> 01:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
they could get if they were able to
 
01:57:03.669 --> 01:57:03.679 align:start position:0%
purchase the program
 
01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
purchase the incentive program how much
 
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
more they could purchase in fruits and
 
01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:08.310 align:start position:0%
more they could purchase in fruits and
vegetables

01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
vegetables
 
01:57:10.149 --> 01:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
we also recently started a program that
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
also benefits new hampshire farmers new
 
01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire feeding new hampshire
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
where we have a certain amount of money
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
that we privately raise to give to our
 
01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:18.719 align:start position:0%

over 400 partner agencies throughout the
state

01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:57:21.109 --> 01:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
where they are able to purchase directly
 
01:57:22.629 --> 01:57:22.639 align:start position:0%
from our local farmers and have that
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
local produce in their
 
01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
pantries and soup kitchens we are doing
 
01:57:27.119 --> 01:57:27.589 align:start position:0%
pantries and soup kitchens we are doing
this

01:57:27.589 --> 01:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
as we said to extend our nutrition
 
01:57:31.750 --> 01:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
programming to helpfully
 
01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully positively impact the health
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
of our
 
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:37.840 align:start position:0%

01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
painless to the state as possible
 
01:57:45.669 --> 01:57:45.679 align:start position:0%
we do all the reporting we are just the
 
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal agent and they are merely a pass
 
01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:48.149 align:start position:0%
fiscal agent and they are merely a pass
through

and increased state costs we have heard
 
01:59:45.189 --> 01:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
today that snap incentive programs
 
01:59:47.669 --> 01:59:47.679 align:start position:0%
provide opportunity for healthy foods
 
01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
for our
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
most at risk families and we know that
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
access to these foods combats the
 
01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
negative health
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
and life impacts of poverty and reduces
 
02:00:00.629 --> 02:00:00.639 align:start position:0%
lifelong costs to the state snap
 
02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
incentive programs also support a
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
healthy triple bottom line as you heard
 
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
senator whitley
 
02:00:07.189 --> 02:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
explained in the beginning and this is
 
02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
by increasing access to healthy foods
 
02:00:10.149 --> 02:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
for families
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
increasing business for farmers and
 
02:00:14.790 --> 02:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
providing a boost to our local economy
 
02:00:16.149 --> 02:00:16.159 align:start position:0%
and you heard brendan
 
02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:17.679 align:start position:0%
speak about that 10 million dollar
 
02:00:20.229 --> 02:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
number so in sum we want to say that the
 
02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
positive impacts of these programs are
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
so essential to
 
02:00:25.109 --> 02:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
our families in new hampshire and even
 
02:00:27.030 --> 02:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
more critical given the challenges coven
 
02:00:28.390 --> 02:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
19 has placed
 
02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
on families facing food and security for
 
02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
these reasons new futures urges the
 
02:00:35.589 --> 02:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
committee to vote senate bill 1998 ought
 
02:00:36.149 --> 02:00:36.159 align:start position:0%

02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon welcome to finance
 
02:01:05.669 --> 02:01:05.679 align:start position:0%
committee hello thank you
 
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
thanks so much thanks for having me
 
02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
my name is liz alpern and i wanted to
 
02:01:12.390 --> 02:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
share that i'm part
 
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
i was part of launching double up food
 
02:01:18.229 --> 02:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
box in new hampshire in 2017.
 
02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
and back in 2017 we worked very closely
 
02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:21.270 align:start position:0%
and back in 2017 we worked very closely
with

02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:01:23.430 --> 02:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
associated grocers of new england based
 
02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
in pembroke to
 
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
identify stores that would be a good fit
 
02:01:28.470 --> 02:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
for the program
 
02:01:30.790 --> 02:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
we actually started with four stores in
 
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
this program and as you've heard
 
02:01:35.910 --> 02:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
we now have grown to 18 participating
 
02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
retailers in nine
 
02:01:38.790 --> 02:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
counties throughout the state of new
 
02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:40.229 align:start position:0%
counties throughout the state of new
hampshire

02:01:40.229 --> 02:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
and in particular i wanted to share that
 
02:01:45.430 --> 02:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
our local retailers really do benefit
 
02:01:47.350 --> 02:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
from participating in this program and
 
02:01:48.629 --> 02:01:48.639 align:start position:0%
we currently have more
 
02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
stores that want to participate in this
 
02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:51.910 align:start position:0%
stores that want to participate in this
program

02:01:51.910 --> 02:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
than we can possibly on board given the
 
02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:55.270 align:start position:0%
than we can possibly on board given the
budget

02:01:55.270 --> 02:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:01:57.510 --> 02:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
and so our hope is to expand the reach
 
02:01:58.709 --> 02:01:58.719 align:start position:0%
of this program
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
uh beyond those 18 stores
 
02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to just offer one example
 
02:02:07.510 --> 02:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
um we work with a berlin marketplace
 
02:02:10.629 --> 02:02:10.639 align:start position:0%
in berlin new hampshire berlin was
 
02:02:12.149 --> 02:02:12.159 align:start position:0%
berlin marketplace was one of the
 
02:02:13.830 --> 02:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
original stores to join
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
the program in 2017 the pilot program
 
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
this is the only fully operational
 
02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
grocery store in berlin
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
it serves a really wide array of
 
02:02:25.990 --> 02:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
community members and
 
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
the program has continued to grow in
 
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
that store and in that community over
 
02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
time it attracts new customers to the
 
02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:34.229 align:start position:0%
time it attracts new customers to the
store

02:02:34.229 --> 02:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
store
 
02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
and it also helps retain existing
 
02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
customers so they are shopping locally
 
02:02:40.629 --> 02:02:40.639 align:start position:0%
in berlin
 
02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
and not just going down the street to
 
02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:44.390 align:start position:0%
and not just going down the street to
walmart

02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
walmart
 
02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
and in particular what touches me so
 
02:02:48.310 --> 02:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
much about working at a store like
 
02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
berlin marketplace is that the manager's
 
02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:50.709 align:start position:0%
berlin marketplace is that the manager's
there

02:02:50.709 --> 02:02:50.719 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:02:52.629 --> 02:02:52.639 align:start position:0%
and the cashiers there they know the
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
shoppers they know the farmers who sell
 
02:02:57.030 --> 02:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
them the summer squash the mushrooms the
 
02:02:57.040 --> 02:02:58.149 align:start position:0%
them the summer squash the mushrooms the
herbs

02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
herbs
 
02:03:00.149 --> 02:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
during the grows growing season and this
 
02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
is an independently owned store that has
 
02:03:04.470 --> 02:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
benefited the community for decades and
 
02:03:05.990 --> 02:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
programs like double up food bugs help
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
these stores continue to
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
thrive in those local communities so i'm
 
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
more than happy to answer any questions
 
02:03:13.669 --> 02:03:13.679 align:start position:0%
about the retail aspect of the program
 
02:03:13.990 --> 02:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
and how
 
02:03:16.470 --> 02:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
it benefits all of our local business
 
02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:17.109 align:start position:0%
it benefits all of our local business

of sb 98
 
02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
as lizel pern had pointed out
 
02:04:15.669 --> 02:04:15.679 align:start position:0%
we are one of the retailers one of those
 
02:04:18.069 --> 02:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
that has grown into the program
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
and we happen to be one of the larger
 
02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
retailers in the state
 
02:04:24.709 --> 02:04:24.719 align:start position:0%
when we became part of it we saw
 
02:04:26.790 --> 02:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
immediate impact and i'm not talking
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
about to our bottom line specifically
 
02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about to the number of sign
 
02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:31.430 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about to the number of sign
ups

02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
ups
 
02:04:34.709 --> 02:04:34.719 align:start position:0%
for this program that surprised even us
 
02:04:36.629 --> 02:04:36.639 align:start position:0%
a store that has been selling groceries
 
02:04:39.669 --> 02:04:39.679 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire since 1936.
 
02:04:41.589 --> 02:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
so you know since the time we joined the
 
02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
program snap recipients shopping here
 
02:04:45.669 --> 02:04:45.679 align:start position:0%
purchased over a hundred and twenty
 
02:04:48.149 --> 02:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in fresh produce
 
02:04:50.550 --> 02:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
and that allowed us to to really serve
 
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
some of the most
 
02:04:53.990 --> 02:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
vulnerable in our communities and really
 
02:04:54.790 --> 02:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
double their
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
double their buying power for fruits and
 
02:04:59.510 --> 02:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
vegetables using those snap funds so
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
just to get right to the point families
 
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
with limited income
 
02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
they know the value that fresh produce
 
02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:06.390 align:start position:0%
they know the value that fresh produce
provides

02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
provides
 
02:05:08.229 --> 02:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
we've seen them jump at the chance to
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
eat nutritiously
 
02:05:12.470 --> 02:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
and buy from local farmers so this is
 
02:05:14.149 --> 02:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
about helping local people with
 
02:05:16.149 --> 02:05:16.159 align:start position:0%
resources that are close to home
 
02:05:18.790 --> 02:05:18.800 align:start position:0%

02:05:22.709 --> 02:05:22.719 align:start position:0%

organization composed of health care and
 
02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
public health professionals
 
02:06:11.510 --> 02:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
for the last 25 years we've advocated
 
02:06:13.189 --> 02:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
for policies that improve the health of
 
02:06:14.629 --> 02:06:14.639 align:start position:0%

behalf of our members and partners to
 
02:06:20.069 --> 02:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
state our strong support
 
02:06:23.350 --> 02:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
of sb 98 relative to the snap incentive
 
02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:24.390 align:start position:0%
of sb 98 relative to the snap incentive
program

02:06:24.390 --> 02:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
and um what i really wanted to foot stop
 
02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:27.750 align:start position:0%
and um what i really wanted to foot stop
to

02:06:27.750 --> 02:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
the committee is that this is an
 
02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
evidence-based best practices
 
02:06:34.390 --> 02:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
program that is actually shown in
 
02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
studies to increase servings of fruits
 
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
and vegetables by snap participants
 
02:06:40.950 --> 02:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
by as much as five servings per day and
 
02:06:43.189 --> 02:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
so what of course that equals out to
 
02:06:46.069 --> 02:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
is more health and more prosperity and
 
02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
better economics for the state so for
 
02:06:48.159 --> 02:06:49.109 align:start position:0%
better economics for the state so for
sb-98

02:06:49.109 --> 02:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
sb-98
 
02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's not just about improving access to
 
02:06:52.629 --> 02:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
food for the hungry but it's also about
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
improving access to healthy foods
 
02:06:56.229 --> 02:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
for those that are suffering from lower
 
02:06:58.229 --> 02:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
diet quality meaning the foods that we
 
02:06:59.910 --> 02:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
eat that nourish our bodies
 
02:07:02.149 --> 02:07:02.159 align:start position:0%
in the granite state that can impact not
 
02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
only their health but their productivity
 
02:07:05.350 --> 02:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
and their prosperity in new hampshire's
 
02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:06.310 align:start position:0%
and their prosperity in new hampshire's
economy

02:07:06.310 --> 02:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
economy
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll take any questions
 
02:07:09.510 --> 02:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
about the health benefits and and
 
02:07:12.149 --> 02:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
the research behind the actual snap
 
02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:14.400 align:start position:0%

move into the executive session on this
bill

02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:07:51.669 --> 02:07:51.679 align:start position:0%
mr chair i believe uh representative
 
02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
umberger has a question
 
02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative burgess sorry did
 
02:07:57.430 --> 02:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
you want question before i close the
 
02:07:57.440 --> 02:07:58.310 align:start position:0%
you want question before i close the
hearing

02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:08:02.470 --> 02:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh yes i think so um
 
02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
if i understood this bill this is a
 
02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:09.510 align:start position:0%
if i understood this bill this is a
one-time

02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
one-time
 
02:08:16.709 --> 02:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:20.069 --> 02:08:20.079 align:start position:0%
the uh these
 
02:08:22.950 --> 02:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
finance or the fiscal note just shows it
 
02:08:26.470 --> 02:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
for 2022 and not for 2023
 
02:08:29.830 --> 02:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's correct and i i was
 
02:08:33.589 --> 02:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
um i was concerned that if we are going
 
02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:40.950 --> 02:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
that it would appear to me that it
 
02:08:42.310 --> 02:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
should be
 
02:08:46.709 --> 02:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
for more than one year because it is not
 
02:08:50.629 --> 02:08:50.639 align:start position:0%
a um
 
02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's not it didn't appear to be a
 
02:08:54.790 --> 02:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
one-year program it seemed to me as i
 
02:08:57.030 --> 02:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
was listening to the testimony
 
02:09:00.470 --> 02:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
that this is something that should occur
 
02:09:04.550 --> 02:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
more than one year and i guess my other
 
02:09:06.550 --> 02:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
question would be
 
02:09:10.149 --> 02:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
do we know if the senate is planning to
 
02:09:11.109 --> 02:09:11.119 align:start position:0%
put this
 
02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:20.310 --> 02:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
or are we just going to
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
um allocate this money
 
02:09:27.189 --> 02:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
and hope for the best all right let's
 
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
let's see if we have anybody from the
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
senate that can answer this question
 
02:09:32.790 --> 02:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
anybody in the senate that's still
 
02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:36.310 align:start position:0%
anybody in the senate that's still
listening

02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:38.709 --> 02:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
any of the food bank people that might
 
02:09:40.390 --> 02:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
know the answer
 
02:09:43.109 --> 02:09:43.119 align:start position:0%
so i do have eileen who we could let's
 
02:09:53.189 --> 02:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:57.830 --> 02:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:59.189 --> 02:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
i call her by your first name because
 
02:10:03.510 --> 02:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:06.390 --> 02:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
it actually appears on the fiscal note
 
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
for 150
 
02:10:10.950 --> 02:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
000 in fiscal 22 but is broken down in
 
02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:11.830 align:start position:0%
000 in fiscal 22 but is broken down in
expenditures

02:10:11.830 --> 02:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
over fiscal 22 and fiscal 23 of 75
 
02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
000 each and we would be more than happy
 
02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
to come back every year and ask for it
 
02:10:21.750 --> 02:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
in each biennium budget
 
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
if you would support it thank you
 
02:10:28.069 --> 02:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
okay does that answer your question yes
 
02:10:29.669 --> 02:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i did not go down to the
 
02:10:30.629 --> 02:10:30.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal note i
 
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:33.840 align:start position:0%

02:10:41.189 --> 02:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
you have a question for
 
02:10:44.229 --> 02:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:46.629 --> 02:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
i don't i was wondering when we were
 
02:10:48.149 --> 02:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
going to get to the
 
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
exact session on this because i have an
 
02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
amendment and a lot of research that
 
02:10:53.990 --> 02:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
i've done that
 
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking for the appropriate
 
02:10:57.990 --> 02:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
time to share with the committee
 
02:11:01.750 --> 02:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
okay if there's uh no further questions
 
02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
in the public hearing section we'll
 
02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
close that again
 
02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
and we'll go to the exact session
 
02:11:12.229 --> 02:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
representative edwards representative
 
02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
nordgren did you have a question
 
02:11:17.910 --> 02:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
in well well i guess i'm just confused
 
02:11:20.149 --> 02:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
because the calendar lists
 
02:11:23.109 --> 02:11:23.119 align:start position:0%
division three meeting at one o'clock on
 
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
this bill and our other bill so i just
 
02:11:28.950 --> 02:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
wanted a clarification we're going to
 
02:11:30.550 --> 02:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
find out now whether representative
 
02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:31.270 align:start position:0%
find out now whether representative
edwards

02:11:31.270 --> 02:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
edwards
 
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
so there was some thought he may cancel
 
02:11:37.119 --> 02:11:38.550 align:start position:0%
so there was some thought he may cancel
it

02:11:38.550 --> 02:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
well the division members haven't heard
 
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
that neither is the public
 
02:11:46.229 --> 02:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative edwards is recognized
 
02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:11:53.830 --> 02:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
um when i first got this bill uh i began
 
02:11:56.310 --> 02:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
to research it by contacting
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
sponsors and co-sponsors and
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
i went into it initially with a couple
 
02:12:02.159 --> 02:12:03.270 align:start position:0%
i went into it initially with a couple
of

02:12:03.270 --> 02:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
thoughts about it one is that
 
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
when you look at the underlying federal
 
02:12:12.229 --> 02:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
program the gus schumacher program
 
02:12:15.750 --> 02:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
on their website they state that
 
02:12:17.669 --> 02:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
the federal government is running a
 
02:12:19.830 --> 02:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
pilot program on this
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
through october excuse me through
 
02:12:27.510 --> 02:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 which means that october
 
02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:28.069 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 which means that october
1

02:12:28.069 --> 02:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
1
 
02:12:32.149 --> 02:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
2023 if their website is correct the
 
02:12:35.350 --> 02:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
program will expire so i thought it
 
02:12:37.510 --> 02:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate for us to have
 
02:12:40.229 --> 02:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
a suspense state included so that if the
 
02:12:40.239 --> 02:12:41.270 align:start position:0%
a suspense state included so that if the
program

02:12:41.270 --> 02:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
expired and there no longer was any
 
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
federal money then
 
02:12:47.589 --> 02:12:47.599 align:start position:0%
the state component of this would would
 
02:12:47.599 --> 02:12:48.149 align:start position:0%
the state component of this would would
uh

02:12:48.149 --> 02:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
automatically sunset um from
 
02:12:54.550 --> 02:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh i i then subsequently had a long
 
02:12:56.229 --> 02:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
conversation with uh
 
02:12:59.589 --> 02:12:59.599 align:start position:0%
miss chris santanella of dhhs and miss
 
02:13:00.550 --> 02:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
maureen burke
 
02:13:04.229 --> 02:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
also of dhhs and miss burke
 
02:13:07.589 --> 02:13:07.599 align:start position:0%
who follows us pretty closely
 
02:13:10.709 --> 02:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
assures me that although the
 
02:13:12.790 --> 02:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
program at the federal level is
 
02:13:14.149 --> 02:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
scheduled to sunset
 
02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
at the end of fy23
 
02:13:19.669 --> 02:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
she believes that the administration has
 
02:13:21.510 --> 02:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
indicated that they're going to continue
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
the program
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
past that and so
 
02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
so if that's the case then
 
02:13:31.510 --> 02:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
my interest in the sunset dissipates a
 
02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:32.550 align:start position:0%
my interest in the sunset dissipates a
bit

02:13:32.550 --> 02:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
bit
 
02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
the other part of this was i thought
 
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
that since there was a
 
02:13:39.830 --> 02:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
grant program there that that we we
 
02:13:41.589 --> 02:13:41.599 align:start position:0%
should ask the department
 
02:13:43.589 --> 02:13:43.599 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and apply for a federal
 
02:13:43.599 --> 02:13:44.709 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and apply for a federal
match

02:13:44.709 --> 02:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
match
 
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
so that the state's share was reduced in
 
02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:49.189 align:start position:0%
so that the state's share was reduced in
half

02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
half
 
02:13:52.470 --> 02:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
and and again both ms antonella and ms
 
02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:52.870 align:start position:0%
and and again both ms antonella and ms
burke

02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
burke
 
02:13:56.149 --> 02:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
assured me that the grants
 
02:13:58.149 --> 02:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
are being applied for and they're being
 
02:13:59.830 --> 02:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
applied for by our two
 
02:14:02.310 --> 02:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
private uh charitable organizations in
 
02:14:03.750 --> 02:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
the state that have been running this
 
02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
program for a while
 
02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
so so my interest in that is sloughed
 
02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:09.589 align:start position:0%
so so my interest in that is sloughed
off

02:14:09.589 --> 02:14:09.599 align:start position:0%
off
 
02:14:13.270 --> 02:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
so um so although i had ols
 
02:14:16.790 --> 02:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
create an amendment to this um
 
02:14:20.069 --> 02:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
i i'm not seeing a compelling need
 
02:14:24.069 --> 02:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
to complicate uh the legislative process
 
02:14:27.270 --> 02:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
with um a big debate on it
 
02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
because i i i don't know that either of
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
the reasons for the amendment
 
02:14:34.550 --> 02:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
are as compelling as i thought they were
 
02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:35.990 align:start position:0%
are as compelling as i thought they were
initially

02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
initially
 
02:14:39.270 --> 02:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
so i i don't see a need to to
 
02:14:42.390 --> 02:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
debate the amendment and because we've
 
02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:42.950 align:start position:0%
debate the amendment and because we've
had

02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
had
 
02:14:45.430 --> 02:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
so much testimony in today's finance
 
02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:46.229 align:start position:0%
so much testimony in today's finance
committee

02:14:46.229 --> 02:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
from people who were scheduled to come
 
02:14:50.709 --> 02:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
in at one o'clock to division three
 
02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
i i would be fine accepting
 
02:14:57.109 --> 02:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
today's testimony to be
 
02:15:00.790 --> 02:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
adequate to our purposes those purposes
 
02:15:02.069 --> 02:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
are furthered
 
02:15:05.189 --> 02:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
with the knowledge that senator aaron
 
02:15:05.199 --> 02:15:07.109 align:start position:0%
with the knowledge that senator aaron
hennessey

02:15:07.109 --> 02:15:07.119 align:start position:0%
hennessey
 
02:15:10.550 --> 02:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
has stated that if uh
 
02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
if we were to retain this bill uh
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
she is at a point in the budgetary
 
02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:17.350 align:start position:0%
she is at a point in the budgetary
process

02:15:17.350 --> 02:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
where she can take care of it and make
 
02:15:21.990 --> 02:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
sure it gets into the budget
 
02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
and so um so because
 
02:15:28.629 --> 02:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
um the senate is uh looks to be
 
02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
committed to
 
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
to funding this um and because
 
02:15:37.669 --> 02:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh my amendment i think is largely moot
 
02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
i i would i would i would ask the
 
02:15:42.790 --> 02:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
committee to consider
 
02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
um that we we go ahead and trust
 
02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
senator hennessey to take care of the
 
02:15:51.030 --> 02:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
funding for us on the senate
 
02:15:54.149 --> 02:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
side of this in that uh when we get an
 
02:15:57.189 --> 02:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity that we vote to retain
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative edwards any

further comments from the committee
 
02:16:09.430 --> 02:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
i guess i'll entertain a motion to
 
02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:11.270 align:start position:0%
i guess i'll entertain a motion to
retain

02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
retain
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
senate bill 98 on the promise that it
 
02:16:17.990 --> 02:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
will likely be funded in the budget i
 
02:16:22.310 --> 02:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
move sir that we retain senate bill 98
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%

02:16:25.830 --> 02:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
to fund this
 
02:16:28.709 --> 02:16:28.719 align:start position:0%

to it and how how you're working with
 
02:21:58.550 --> 02:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
the governor's office and the department
 
02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
i just happened to re-read it again and
 
02:22:02.070 --> 02:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
for the first time
 
02:22:05.670 --> 02:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
it popped out at me that uh with this
 
02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh our this in the rsa
 
02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
the commissioner could potentially
 
02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh extend the timeline for repayments
 
02:22:19.429 --> 02:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
indefinitely without any limitation to
 
02:22:19.990 --> 02:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
how far
 
02:22:22.469 --> 02:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
that they could be extended to the
 
02:22:22.479 --> 02:22:23.349 align:start position:0%
that they could be extended to the
effect

02:22:23.349 --> 02:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
effect
 
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
of of canceling the repayment altogether
 
02:22:28.790 --> 02:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
do you do you think that was the intent
 
02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
of this legislation or do you
 
02:22:32.870 --> 02:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
do or do you disagree with me that that
 
02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
may be the effect
 
02:22:37.990 --> 02:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
of this legislation the original wording
 
02:22:39.910 --> 02:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
of that did come from the governor's
 
02:22:39.920 --> 02:22:41.270 align:start position:0%
of that did come from the governor's
office

02:22:41.270 --> 02:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
but when health and human services
 
02:22:43.439 --> 02:22:45.110 align:start position:0%
but when health and human services
testifies

02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
testifies
 
02:22:47.110 --> 02:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
they will tell you that the both
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
sections of the bill
 
02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
are not needed and will give you some
 
02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
indication of where they're already
 
02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:54.790 align:start position:0%
indication of where they're already
covered

02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
covered
 
02:22:58.070 --> 02:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
so although your question is interesting
 
02:23:00.630 --> 02:23:00.640 align:start position:0%

02:26:39.030 --> 02:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
of that and they're not considered
 
02:26:42.630 --> 02:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
technically homeless um but yet we can't
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
assist those
 
02:26:46.389 --> 02:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
individuals in the current structure and
 
02:26:46.399 --> 02:26:47.030 align:start position:0%
individuals in the current structure and
so

02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:50.070 --> 02:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
um also the way the current
 
02:26:53.349 --> 02:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
homeless um housing access revolving
 
02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
loan fund
 
02:26:56.630 --> 02:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
is funded it doesn't allow for any
 
02:26:58.389 --> 02:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
administrative expenses
 
02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
for the partner agencies and so
 
02:27:05.190 --> 02:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
in the last biennium we actually added
 
02:27:08.710 --> 02:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
a million dollars in the um
 
02:27:10.870 --> 02:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
for the eviction prevention funds and
 
02:27:13.110 --> 02:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
that helps people who are homeless but
 
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
it also assists us
 
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
to support people before they become
 
02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
homeless to remain in their housing
 
02:27:21.750 --> 02:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
because we know that that's
 
02:27:24.550 --> 02:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
what our ultimate goal is um and it's
 
02:27:27.190 --> 02:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
much more comprehensive and so
 
02:27:31.110 --> 02:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
um because we have that fund um this
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
is not really necessary at this moment
 
02:27:35.429 --> 02:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
in time
 
02:27:38.230 --> 02:27:38.240 align:start position:0%

02:27:40.150 --> 02:27:40.160 align:start position:0%

02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
well it had it did have money in it
 
02:32:27.910 --> 02:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
no i mean uh as an itl doesn't the whole

02:35:27.110 --> 02:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
people still want to go
 
02:35:29.910 --> 02:35:29.920 align:start position:0%

02:35:43.270 --> 02:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative uh weiler yes
 
02:35:46.630 --> 02:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
um i really think
 
02:35:50.469 --> 02:35:50.479 align:start position:0%
that um other folks should be
 
02:35:54.309 --> 02:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
allowed to go on that tour
 
02:35:57.429 --> 02:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
if you have never been to the uh
 
02:36:01.030 --> 02:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
secure psychiatric place
 
02:36:04.870 --> 02:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
i uh i think it's uh informative
 
02:36:08.790 --> 02:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
and um it's something that
 
02:36:11.670 --> 02:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
all of us i think on finance uh
 
02:36:13.030 --> 02:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
certainly need to be
 
02:36:19.110 --> 02:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
somebody extend an invitation to the
 
02:36:26.630 --> 02:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
remainder of the the committee
 
02:36:30.870 --> 02:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
i recognize that division three
 
02:36:33.349 --> 02:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
you know looks at that more carefully
 
02:36:34.469 --> 02:36:34.479 align:start position:0%
than the rest of us
 
02:36:37.670 --> 02:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
but uh it certainly is an eye-opening
 
02:36:37.680 --> 02:36:39.510 align:start position:0%
but uh it certainly is an eye-opening
experience

02:36:39.510 --> 02:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
experience
 
02:36:41.110 --> 02:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative umberger i i
 
02:36:42.870 --> 02:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
just went to division three because i
 
02:36:44.309 --> 02:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
thought it wouldn't be difficult to add
 
02:36:45.510 --> 02:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
a couple more people
 
02:36:47.910 --> 02:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
but everyone that in the in the
 
02:36:48.790 --> 02:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
committee is
 
02:36:51.590 --> 02:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
hereby invited uh representative edwards
 
02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:52.150 align:start position:0%
hereby invited uh representative edwards
will

02:36:52.150 --> 02:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:36:55.270 --> 02:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
set up the appropriate thing and
 
02:36:57.190 --> 02:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
realize that it has to be 48 hours in
 
02:36:59.349 --> 02:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
advance and they probably want to look
 
02:37:01.270 --> 02:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
at all your background investigation
 
02:37:03.270 --> 02:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
which i'm sure is no problem
 
02:37:06.790 --> 02:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
but let that be done yes you're smiling
 
02:37:08.309 --> 02:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
because we both had top secret
 
02:37:10.070 --> 02:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
clearances where they
 
02:37:13.429 --> 02:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
dig into everything thank you all right
 
02:37:17.349 --> 02:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:19.750 --> 02:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your attendance and i will
 
02:37:23.270 --> 02:37:23.280 align:start position:0%

02:37:37.110 --> 02:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
oh all right and since we have a motion
 
02:37:38.950 --> 02:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
in a second we don't need to
 
02:37:42.950 --> 02:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh do a roll call so we are adjourned
