00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
do beforehand I know we are short of
 
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
time but a lot of the bills coming up
 
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
soon uh will be in the area of their
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and if we could have
 
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
maybe next Friday a short 30 minute
 
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
presentation maybe using some of our uh
 
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:58.360 align:start position:0%
lunch period as well as maybe a 15minute
 
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:01.240 align:start position:0%
delay in the other hearings we could
 
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
squeeze them in perhaps so I think that
 
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
would be advantageous if we could do
 
00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative ssuch I
 
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519 align:start position:0%
will check with the es to find out if
 
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
they could do a presentation at
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
lunchtime the chair recognizes
 
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
question go I'm sorry that was uh from
 
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
raising my hand earlier about the list
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
of uh committee members on the website I
 
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.590 align:start position:0%
of uh committee members on the website I
apologize

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very
 
00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:36.519 align:start position:0%
much without further Ado then let us
 
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
begin the business of the day and I
 
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.269 align:start position:0%
begin the business of the day and I
will

00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
call to order the public hearing on
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:09:48.959 --> 00:09:50.630 align:start position:0%
House Bill
168

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
168
 
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
dfn which requires the adoption of
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
innovative vehicle emission standards
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
pursuant to section
 
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
177 of the the federal Clean Air
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
Act and I recognize representative MC
 
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:07.720 align:start position:0%
Williams the prime sponsor to introduce
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
this legislation representative
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
McWilliams thank you uh chair Vose and
 
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee uh my
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
name is representative Rebecca
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
McWilliams I represent the west side of
 
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
conquered uh at large um and I am
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill again um because
 
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
we've had a robust discussion uh during
 
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
the last session year about what New
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can do to address air
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
emissions quality and uh catch up to
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
some of the surrounding states and
 
00:10:43.629 --> 00:10:43.639 align:start position:0%
policy that seems to be moving forward
 
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
towards air emissions concerns in the
 
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
United States so the bill is back um
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
there are some changes to this bill
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
since you've last seen it if you were
 
00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:57.639 align:start position:0%
participating in st&amp; the last go around
 
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
um right now the focus on the bill is
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
really to create an on-ramp for um car
 
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
dealers here in New Hampshire uh who
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
would receive retroactive credit for
 
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
having cars on their Lots so for
 
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
everyone else who has not yet seen this
 
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
bill let me just provide a little bit of
 
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
background um the intention of this bill
 
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
is to protect Public Health here in New
 
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire U Motor Vehicles account for
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
half of the emissions of ground level
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
ozone which is a contributing factor to
 
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
asthma and we certainly have low-lying
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
areas within the state that are in
 
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
valleys um Keen as an example uh where
 
00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:35.959 align:start position:0%
uh the emissions will sort of settle and
 
00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
cause issues with human health um and
 
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
breathing problems uh in addition uh
 
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:43.720 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle emissions contribute to
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
one-third of New Hampshire's greenhouse
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
gas emissions which are also
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
contributing factor to climate change so
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
considering both of those factors this
 
00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
proactive um uh in addition this bill
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
also provides an emission specific
 
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
warranty for the vehicles that fall
 
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
under this legislation that is a 15-year
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
150 mile uh warranty specific to
 
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
emissions um which is obviously much
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
greater than what we have right now
 
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire law for any of our
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
warranty requirements for cars uh
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
finally this sets percentage
 
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
requirements for car dealers here in New
 
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to carry zero emissions
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
Vehicles which we call zevs and low
 
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
emissions Vehicles which we call levs so
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
when I talk about zevs and levs that's
 
00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:38.389 align:start position:0%
when I talk about zevs and levs that's
the

00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
acronym um so right now we have limited
 
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
choices when someone decides on a
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
Saturday morning that they want to go
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
out and buy a car and they'll head to
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
their local dealership and depending on
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
where they're located in the state
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
whether it's a Metro or more rural area
 
00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
um they'll go to their local dealership
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
and test drive some vehicles Les um
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire is the only
 
00:13:04.189 --> 00:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
Northeast State right now that's not
 
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:07.240 align:start position:0%
participating in section 177 which is
 
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
the California air emission standard
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
there is no requirement that a certain
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
percentage of vehicles on all dealer
 
00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
Lots in New Hampshire actually meet the
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
zeven love requirements so basically
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
that what that means is when someone
 
00:13:20.829 --> 00:13:20.839 align:start position:0%
goes out and decides they want to test
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
drive vehicles depending on what their
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
local dealership is carrying they may or
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
may not actually have an opportunity to
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
test drive that type of vehicle so there
 
00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
are limited
 
00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:36.279 align:start position:0%
choices um so knowing that um let me
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
just give you a little bit of background
 
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
about exactly what that means for
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
credits and uh dealerships carrying
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
certain types of zevs and lebs so
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
credits are based on a vehicle's zero
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
emission ranges so a long range vehicle
 
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
like a Tesla or a Chevy bolt could earn
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
as much as three to four credits plug-in
 
00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:01.759 align:start position:0%
hybrids like uh the Chevy Volt as
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
opposed to bolt the volt is more like a
 
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
half of a credit so the credits
 
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
translate roughly into the automakers
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
selling a certain percentage in each of
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
the um increasing requirement years so
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
less than 5% zevs in 2023 less than 6%
 
00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.430 align:start position:0%
less than 5% zevs in 2023 less than 6%
in

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
2025 and this is based on the total
 
00:14:27.069 --> 00:14:27.079 align:start position:0%
volume sold of each dealership so the
 
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
requirements for having the vehicles on
 
00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:32.519 align:start position:0%
the lot change depending on the scale of
 
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
how many vehicles are sold per
 
00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:37.959 align:start position:0%
dealership um so if a dealership fails
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
to meet the credit requirement then they
 
00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
have another year to comply um or they
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
will end up paying a fine it really is
 
00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:46.759 align:start position:0%
flexible and right now nobody in the
 
00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:48.519 align:start position:0%
Northeast has been required to pay a
 
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
fine for missing um or not hitting that
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
credit requirement this has been um fair
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
and flexible up to this date um these
 
00:14:59.749 --> 00:14:59.759 align:start position:0%
rules don't take take any Vehicles off
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
the road uh these rules do not force
 
00:15:06.749 --> 00:15:06.759 align:start position:0%
anyone to buy a Zev um and the Zev rule
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
increases customer Choice meaning there
 
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
are more options for that type of
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
vehicle made by that manufacturer on the
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
lot the rules do apply primarily to the
 
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
automakers not to the dealers because
 
00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:20.839 align:start position:0%
because it is forcing the automakers to
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
push out more zevs and levs um and it is
 
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
a Statewide rule but it's typically met
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
through the larger dealerships uh the
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
goal here is to address the need in the
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
state and start increasing our overall
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
State availability starting in 2023 and
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
moving forward 2025 2027 until it
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
becomes mainstream this is also not a um
 
00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
Financial Credit system you may have
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
received some testimony um from folks
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
who oppose this bill saying well the
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
really the way to uh get people to
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
change behavior and buy Zev and lebs is
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
to provide some kind of state cash on
 
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
the hood program so that they will
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
actually buy the vehicle and get it a
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
tax right off or get money back that's
 
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
not the way this program has written
 
00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
this program has written to Simply put
 
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
the cars on Lots in New Hampshire make
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
it available to the public so that
 
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
they're able to test drive and the more
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
they test drive the more they buy um
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
just a little bit of data about what's
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
been changing in the automo automotive
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
industry since I last presented a
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
similar version of this bill um
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
Volkswagen group has now committed to go
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
all electric by
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
2030 uh GM will phase out combustion
 
00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
engines worldwide by 2035 and will be
 
00:16:38.829 --> 00:16:38.839 align:start position:0%
carbon neutral by
 
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:41.720 align:start position:0%
2040 Ford is rolling out an all electric
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
F-150 this year which is their Flagship
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle um and they have a goal of
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
carbon neutrality worldwide by
 
00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
2050 and Mercedes-Benz will produce
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
electrified versions of all of their
 
00:16:54.749 --> 00:16:54.759 align:start position:0%
cars by
 
00:16:58.509 --> 00:16:58.519 align:start position:0%
2022 so the future is now um certainly
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
we are seeing more and more of these
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
vehicles available and the intent of
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
this goal is to make New Hampshire an
 
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity for everyone who lives here
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
to test drive and potentially buy a Zev
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
or a
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative uh MC
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
Williams for your bill
 
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
introduction uh do we have any questions
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
for representative Mick Williams I see
 
00:17:30.669 --> 00:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
there are a few I have a question myself
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
and I will start representative
 
00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
McWilliams last year when we heard this
 
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
bill we were told that without a buyer's
 
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
incentive uh this bill would simply
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily penalize automotive
 
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
dealers does the new version coner
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
contain a buyer incentive
 
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
provision uh thank you for your question
 
00:17:59.230 --> 00:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose uh just to be clear clear
 
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
this is not a cash on the H program and
 
00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:03.799 align:start position:0%
there are no monies from the state that
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
are being given to people who purchase
 
00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
Vehicles as an incentive uh that's
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
intentional I I have heard from the
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
opponents that you mentioned uh who say
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
that this program is not going to work
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
without the cash on the hood incentive
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
um and I I would respond to that by
 
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
saying we now have the critical momentum
 
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
that we did not have last year the
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
automotive manufacturers are now seeing
 
00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
the writing on the wall and switching to
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
producing Zev and LS as a standard and
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
so the industry has now moved over that
 
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
huge hurdle therefore the state does not
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
need to take on that additional
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
Financial requirement taking everyone's
 
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
tax dollars and incentivizing
 
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
individuals purchasing and upgrading to
 
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
Zev and Lev um so I think you'll see
 
00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:52.039 align:start position:0%
that um the market has shifted we're
 
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
now thank you for that answer follow-up
 
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
if the manufacturers of these vehicles
 
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
have already pledged to make more of
 
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
them then why do we need to uh penalize
 
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
enough so to be clear this is not meant
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
to be a penalty to Automotive
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
manufacturers this is meant to be a
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
please take those cars you've made and
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
deliver them to New Hampshire just like
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
you're delivering them to Massachusetts
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
Maine Vermont Rhode Island Connecticut
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
New York we'd like them too you don't
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
need to have your truck stop there and
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
not bring them here to New Hampshire so
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
incentive okay uh well I'm gonna have to
 
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
follow up one more time and I apologize
 
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
for um that
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
but if it's not a penalty then why on
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
page two of the bill line
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
25 does it state that the Department of
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services shall impose a
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
civil penalty not to exceed $37,500
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
on any manufacturer who sells attempts
 
00:20:12.909 --> 00:20:12.919 align:start position:0%
to sell or causes to be offered for sale
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
a new motor vehicle that fails to meet
 
00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:17.559 align:start position:0%
the applicable emission standards that
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
sounds like a penalty to
 
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
me so just to be clear what you're
 
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
talking about is someone who's making a
 
00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.830 align:start position:0%
talking about is someone who's making a
false

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
false
 
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
representation which obviously through
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
law we don't want a false representation
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
about uh the air emissions quality of a
 
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle so the the intent of that
 
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
provision is to prevent manufacturers
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
from claiming I I know we've already had
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
a very large lawsuit about this a couple
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
years back um from claiming that the
 
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
tailpipe emissions are a certain
 
00:20:51.789 --> 00:20:51.799 align:start position:0%
standard uh the Volkswagen lawsuit was
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
fought about this and then it turns out
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
that that's not the
 
00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.750 align:start position:0%
that that's not the
case

00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that the chair now
 
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative oxam for a
 
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:11.559 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
um is it not the case that the dealers
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
themselves are in
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
in a an inferior position against their
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
competitors across the state border
 
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that this provision
 
00:21:30.269 --> 00:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
exists in other states am I am I
 
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
understanding that correctly or could
 
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
you could you help me out
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
there sure so I mentioned the shift to
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
Chairman Vose uh we are now experiencing
 
00:21:42.669 --> 00:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
um a total shift when it comes to
 
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and commitments to Zev and
 
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
leves uh that means that the states who
 
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
are already on board to having a certain
 
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
percentage Zev and LS on their dealer
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
lots are now already receiving the
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
latest up-to-date latest and greatest
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
Zev and loves from the manufacturers and
 
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
that puts us in New Hampshire at a bit
 
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
disadvantage uh because the dealers who
 
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
choose and there are some in New
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who choose to nonetheless
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
request Zev and LS even though there is
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
no credit associated with that um they
 
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
are often borrowing those cars from
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
across state lines in order to have an
 
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
appointment for a test drive for um
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
let's just say a a Chevy uh
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
bolt uh someone has called the dealer
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
usually um this is in a metro area so
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
let's just say someone calls a dealer in
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and says hey I want to test
 
00:22:36.029 --> 00:22:36.039 align:start position:0%
drive a Chevy bolt dealer in Portsmouth
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
says sure no problem come by Saturday
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
we'll let we'll let you drive one so in
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth they go to Massachusetts or
 
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
Maine and get themselves a bolt shipped
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
to the Portsmouth dealership they do the
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
test drive and if the person wants to
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
purchase the vehicle they can so this a
 
00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
sort of Shifting and rotating stock but
 
00:22:54.669 --> 00:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of actually being able to
 
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
schedule an appointment and drive the
 
00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle you want there's no guarant
 
00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
guantee that you'll be able to do that
 
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:02.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as opposed to if you
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
drive out of state you will be able to
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
find those cars you're looking for May I
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
have a followup follow up thank you very
 
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.549 align:start position:0%
have a followup follow up thank you very
much

00:23:11.549 --> 00:23:11.559 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
uh I I live on the Connecticut River
 
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
boundary and when I was trying to buy a
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
zero emission vehicle I couldn't find
 
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:22.919 align:start position:0%
one in in New Hampshire and had to talk
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
to a manufacturer in Manchester and
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
drive to Manchester after they brought
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
car in and I was able to test drive it
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
whereas I could go 15 minutes away in
 
00:23:36.669 --> 00:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
Vermont and have bought that car so this
 
00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
I I what I'm trying to concentrate our
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
attention on is this is a benefit to New
 
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:44.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses and dealerships and
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
it gives them Leverage is is isn't
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't that also that the case
 
00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
represented and and then I'll I'll stop
 
00:23:52.029 --> 00:23:52.039 align:start position:0%
asking questions doesn't it give
 
00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
leverage to our dealers to be able to
 
00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
obtain these hot ticket
 
00:24:01.149 --> 00:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
items have having this on the books yes
 
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham this does give
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
them leverage to have those latest and
 
00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
greatest zevs and LS on the lot when
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
when they come out rather than having to
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
request them for a specific buyer
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you the chair now
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Homa for a
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair and thank you
 
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams for taking my
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
question uh the question I had is there
 
00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
anything that currently prohib ibits
 
00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
these uh manufacturers and dealers from
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
having these zevs and LS on their
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
lot great question the answer is
 
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
availability uh because we are the only
 
00:24:42.389 --> 00:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
state in the Northeast that has not
 
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
signed on to CH uh section
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
177 it's very difficult to get these
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
vehicles because they end up going to
 
00:24:52.269 --> 00:24:52.279 align:start position:0%
Lots in other states so availability is
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
the the big hurdle thank you can I have
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
a follow on chair follow up um the
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
follow followup I have is that you know
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
from what I understand car manufacturers
 
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
seem to do whatever is financially
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
advantageous for them and so I don't I'm
 
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
not really understanding why they
 
00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do this if it's costing the
 
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
money why they would not want to offer
 
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
this product so I I'm just not clear on
 
00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:16.919 align:start position:0%
how they
 
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
can't have this stock uh in place
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
already should should they
 
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:25.559 align:start position:0%
choose uh sure so just to give you a
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
little bit of background about how it
 
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
works at individual dealerships in New
 
00:25:30.269 --> 00:25:30.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh let's say that you're a
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
Ford dealership um Ford will require
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
that you carry a certain percentage of
 
00:25:40.389 --> 00:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:43.799 align:start position:0%
um pickup trucks right those are the
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
ones that usually sell hot ticket item
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
construction vehicles uh they will also
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
require that you have a certain
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
percentage be um sedans which are not as
 
00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
popular and don't sell as much so the
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are already putting
 
00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
requirements on the dealers for what
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
they keep in their lots and their
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
percentages however the manufacturers
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
are not shifting down the Zan L
 
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
requirements at this time um and that is
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
something that the 14 States across the
 
00:26:13.149 --> 00:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
US have adopted in order to provide some
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
kind of air emissions control because
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers are not doing that and
 
00:26:19.149 --> 00:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
I would say that that's probably the
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
role of the legislature to come up with
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
what our expectations are for air
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
emissions not putting that on a
 
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.789 align:start position:0%
emissions not putting that on a
manufacturer

00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
one more followup thank you thank you
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
for the followup um I understand what
 
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
you're uh what you're saying here the
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
one question I do have is it appropriate
 
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
for the legislator the legislation to be
 
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
telling the manufacturers what they
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
stock so that is what the 14 States
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
who've adopted section 177 are doing and
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
I would argue that it has not died in
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
court so appropriateness from from a
 
00:27:00.909 --> 00:27:00.919 align:start position:0%
Judicial perspective is yes it's allowed
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
um and certainly if we're talking about
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
changing the industry and pushing for
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
more and more emissions regulation here
 
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire then yes it would be
 
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the legislature to be
 
00:27:16.389 --> 00:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
asking uh manufacturers and dealers to
 
00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
provide zevs and levs to New Hampshire
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
residents to test drive and purchase
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
potentially thank you thank you the
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
chair now recognizes representative nter
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question New
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire already has more Electric
 
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
Vehicle registrations than Maine or
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
Vermont so why do we need a
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
bill uh representative n our our total
 
00:27:42.669 --> 00:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
Fleet here in New Hampshire is less than
 
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
half a percentage of the entire state
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
that is electric vehicles so we have a
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
long way to go for it to become the norm
 
00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
or the accepted practice and therefore
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:59.710 --> 00:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
buyers okay thank you uh
 
00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
representative cam
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
brills thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh is C could you uh tell me if there is
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
anything prohibiting New Hampshire
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
dealers if they should get a request for
 
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
such vehicles from their customers from
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
having vehicles transferred from the
 
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
other states to their Lots because I
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
believe that that's a common practice is
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
there anything prohibiting them from
 
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
doing that with these type of vehicles
 
00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:30.919 align:start position:0%
so representative cells as I stated
 
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
earlier in my testimony this has become
 
00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
fairly common practice that uh a New
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire buyer will request a New
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dealership to Source a vehicle
 
00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
from out of state there is no
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
prohibition to this practice but there
 
00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
is an availability issue you cannot
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
always get the vehicle you are looking
 
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
for as a dealership requesting from out
 
00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:53.430 align:start position:0%
for as a dealership requesting from out
of

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
state okay thank you for that question
 
00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
the chair now recognizes representative
 
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:04.519 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
you uh represent MC Williams for taking
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
my question uh could you explain a
 
00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
little bit more about what is the
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
additional extra warranty that buyers
 
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
would have if if the State signed up to
 
00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.430 align:start position:0%
would have if if the State signed up to
this

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
program uh sure
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
um so n Hampshire uh is fairly well
 
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
known for being a state where we don't
 
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
provide a great warranty especially for
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
lemons and used vehicles um we don't
 
00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
currently have a lot of law on the books
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
that protects buyers from a lemon um
 
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:40.039 align:start position:0%
that's certainly something that could be
 
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:41.720 align:start position:0%
brought up as a separate pill at another
 
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
time um but it's sort of buer Beware
 
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
environment here in New Hampshire um so
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we're very
 
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
interested in doing with this bill is
 
00:29:54.509 --> 00:29:54.519 align:start position:0%
allowing an emissions related warranty
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
and that is part of the section 177 uh
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
that will be brought into effect once
 
00:30:02.669 --> 00:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
this legislation passes um the emission
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
specific warranty is a 15year 150,000
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
miles for emissions specific issues so
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
let's say that your tailpipe starts
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
getting Smoky um because you're driving
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
a hybrid low emissions vehicle and
 
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
obviously that's emissions related so
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
it's covered under the warranty it's not
 
00:30:24.909 --> 00:30:24.919 align:start position:0%
going to cost anything out of pocket for
 
00:30:27.509 --> 00:30:27.519 align:start position:0%
that specific owner um and I do want to
 
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:30.200 align:start position:0%
be super clear that there are um quite a
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
bit of savings related to emissions um
 
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
not just under the warranty program
 
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
which of course is an excellent 15E is
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
almost unheard of for standard vehicles
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
um you're you probably would pay a
 
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
little bit more than
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
$1,000 above your usual price to
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
purchase a Lev but your less Fuel and
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
maintenance net savings is approximately
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
$3,000 over the life of the vehicle so
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
you pay a th more you save three grand
 
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
so you've actually reduced your cost by
 
00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:03.799 align:start position:0%
2,000 um for zevs this is where we're
 
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
talking about Teslas and um really
 
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are focused on zero
 
00:31:10.629 --> 00:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
emissions approximate upch charge is
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
going to be 6,000 upfront but you'll
 
00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:15.559 align:start position:0%
spend much less in fuel and maintenance
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
so your net savings is approximately
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 4,000 and
 
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
11,000 over the vehicle's life and that
 
00:31:26.669 --> 00:31:26.679 align:start position:0%
depends on which one you purchased um so
 
00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
the there is a really big potential for
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
savings if you're looking that 11,000
 
00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
for a vehicle that's a Zev and you keep
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
it for quite a significant amount of
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
time so when we're talking about people
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
saving money through warranty we're also
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
talking about paying a little more
 
00:31:43.389 --> 00:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
upfront but being able to save over the
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle uh Mr chairman
 
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
followup follow
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
up F represent MC Williams uh can you
 
00:31:59.149 --> 00:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
can you tell me uh regarding these
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
credits what what are the benefits of
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
this program to the dealers and how does
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
how does that are the credits the
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
providing any benefit to the
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
dealer so the dealers are required to uh
 
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
achieve a certain number of credits
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
based on their sales volume credits are
 
00:32:20.509 --> 00:32:20.519 align:start position:0%
not from sale of a vehicle credits are
 
00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:23.720 align:start position:0%
from having a Zev or a Lev located on
 
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
their lot at their dealership so once
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
the vehicle is delivered once it arrives
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
at say this for dealership that we're
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
talking about once the vehicle arrives
 
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
on the lot that dealer gets the credit
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
for having it on the lot if they then
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
sell it and have another one delivered
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
they get the credit as soon as it
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
arrives on their lot um so the the
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
benefit to the dealer is really to have
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
these vehicles available for test
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
driving and for sales immediately not
 
00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
having to coordinate with an
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
out-of-state dealership to bring in a
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
specific specific vehicle that someone
 
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
would like to test drive and being able
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
to have Cutting Edge topof the line
 
00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
whatever the manufacturer is is now
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
pumping out for their latest and
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
greatest most efficient fuel emission um
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
emissions reduction vehicle thank you
 
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
thank you the chair recognizes
 
00:33:19.629 --> 00:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
representative PL for a question thank
 
00:33:25.389 --> 00:33:25.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:29.240 align:start position:0%
unmute yes thank you uh rep
 
00:33:31.629 --> 00:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams earlier you
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
made statements that uh the
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturers all have goals to become
 
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
100% electric over a period of time and
 
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
I think you mentioned Volkswagen by 2
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
2030 and GM in a similar time frame if
 
00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
so why do we need this bill if it's
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
going to happen
 
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
anyway that's a great question
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
representative plattin it's good to see
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
you um I think the biggest concern
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
really is making sure that New Hampshire
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
is right there at the front of the line
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
along with the rest of the
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
Northeast uh we want to make sure that
 
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not going to lose its
 
00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:07.639 align:start position:0%
Edge or potentially competitive
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
advantage in receiving these vehicles at
 
00:34:12.669 --> 00:34:12.679 align:start position:0%
the time that they are being released we
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
know that those percentage requirements
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
for credits for dealers outside of the
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
state will take precedence over dealers
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
inside the state so once again if there
 
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
is an 18-wheeler delivering vehicles to
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
the Northeast there going to drop off
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
those vehicles to the states that have
 
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
these credit requirements first and then
 
00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
second okay the chair recognizes U
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi for a
 
00:34:44.109 --> 00:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
question don't
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
forget I have a question for the chair I
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
see you're not recognized to speak just
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
yetes pitz you're next on the
 
00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
list what representative bernardy
 
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman uh uh you you may
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
have just answered this uh but uh I'm
 
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
having great difficulty understanding if
 
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
these are the hot ticket
 
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
items why uh there's an availability
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
problem uh if if consumers want these uh
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
dealerships are going to have them on
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
their lot if they don't want them
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be there so please
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
explain the this
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
availability issue make it very
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
clear sure uh so right
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
now if there are brand new Chevy bolts
 
00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
available for delivery to the Northeast
 
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
region they're coming from the
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and they're being shipped
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
up to the
 
00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
Northeast there is an order of
 
00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
Precedence based on dealership volume
 
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
and the relationship of the dealership
 
00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:54.790 align:start position:0%
and the relationship of the dealership
with

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
Chevy so there's sort of a packing order
 
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
already as to who gets the new
 
00:36:03.069 --> 00:36:03.079 align:start position:0%
cars and they are shipping them to the
 
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
states that already have the section 177
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
requirement so that's all of the
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
Northeast except for New Hampshire as a
 
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
priority because they're required to get
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
those credits so New Hampshire falls
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
later in line because there is no credit
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturer to deliver that vehicle to
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right
 
00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:34.309 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right
now

00:36:34.309 --> 00:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
chair follow up go
 
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
ahead okay so I understand that the
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
dealers in Massachusetts and uh other
 
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
surrounding states get some kind of
 
00:36:47.309 --> 00:36:47.319 align:start position:0%
credit but we have very high volume
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
dealers in Manchester and other areas
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
here why are they not getting these
 
00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles if they are the hot ticket
 
00:36:59.230 --> 00:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
items and consumer really want them so
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
to be clear these dealers in Manchester
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
and Portsmouth can request the vehicles
 
00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
and sometimes they do but they can be
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
turned down in favor of another state
 
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
that has the credit requirement they
 
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:22.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:26.109 --> 00:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
you uh okay thank you now representative
 
00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
c p you recognize for a
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
question my first question is to the
 
00:37:34.309 --> 00:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
chair as a procedural matter I guess I
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
had two much Super Bowl last night
 
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
because I'm seeing things that I
 
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't see like gentlemen in your
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
Mountain uh and the other is that I'm
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
not seeing all the participants on the
 
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
screen so even the ones that are on the
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
phone don't appear with a phone number
 
00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
so I'm very confused and I I wish you
 
00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.230 align:start position:0%
so I'm very confused and I I wish you
could

00:37:59.230 --> 00:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
um explain that to
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
me then I have a question for the for
 
00:38:08.349 --> 00:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
Miss MC Williams but I guess I'm a
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
little lost now there he is again I
 
00:38:16.109 --> 00:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
again I'm not on drugs but somebody's
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
Mountain okay can you explain that so
 
00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:25.240 align:start position:0%
the mountain that you see behind me is
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
simply a background that I've chosen to
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
display when I'm on
 
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
zoom and uh that particular mountain is
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
POD Das Mountain if you care about that
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
the view from Hedgehog
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
Mountain um the other question you had
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
is you can't see all the
 
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
participants um not even the phone in on
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
Pardon not even the phone in once and
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
that gentleman is he sitting next to
 
00:38:58.349 --> 00:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
you keeps popping up in your
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
mouth representative mner is sitting
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
next to me on my left and representative
 
00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
Thomas is sitting next to me on my right
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
there was a view of the room here a
 
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
minute ago
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
but there I see the room view of the
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
room oh okay but apparently somebody
 
00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
keeps coming into your camera view and
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
it really it bothers me but let me get
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
on with Miss McWilliams but I can't I
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
only see
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
16 people I don't see 17 and I didn't
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
see representative nada's phone usually
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
when somebody phones in you see their
 
00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.349 align:start position:0%
when somebody phones in you see their
number

00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
representative M I had ask question
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
don't pop up anywhere please
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams I remember
 
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
when we did the the conversion to
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
catalytic conversions and now we have we
 
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
try to AV uh to avoid tailpipe testing
 
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire can you tell me what
 
00:39:59.710 --> 00:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
what happens with tailpipe testing in
 
00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:06.510 align:start position:0%
what happens with tailpipe testing in
New

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm sorry I was muted um this
 
00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
bill does not address tailpipe testing
 
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire this bill is starting
 
00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
from a specific date certain January 1st
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
2023 onward into the future dealerships
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are required to have a
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
certain percentage based on volume and
 
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
their relationship with the manufacturer
 
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
and the requirements of section 177
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
they're required to provide Zev and levs
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
for test drive and sale to the public
 
00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
it's not about tailpipe testing at least
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
legislation uh yes representative C
 
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
pittz and I now see what you were
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
talking about when you said somebody was
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
popping up in my picture it was
 
00:40:53.309 --> 00:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
representative mner to my left so I've
 
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
adjusted my laptop a little bit so
 
00:40:58.589 --> 00:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
hopefully he won't pop up in my frame
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
again but yes please follow up so I
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
didn't have too much Tom Brady um the
 
00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
other question I have is when you could
 
00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:08.710 align:start position:0%
other question I have is when you could
you

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
clarify a Zev and a Lev I low emissions
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
I I believe this is my assumption are
 
00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
hybrids and zero are electric am I
 
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
assumption so yes the the zero emissions
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
vehicle is just what it says it it has
 
00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
no emissions at all it's zero the low
 
00:41:38.589 --> 00:41:38.599 align:start position:0%
emissions is some but not zero and
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
that's why the credits for low emissions
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
can range fairly significantly depending
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
on how much emissions we're talking
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
about but it's still a
 
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
reduction from a typical Automotive
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle thank
 
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh represent ative parall
 
00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a
 
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and as a
 
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
side note to uh uh representative of uh
 
00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
C pittz I'd be glad to spend two minutes
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
uh during our lunchtime if you'd like to
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
get your gallery view up I've got a full
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
view gallery and it that's all I can get
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
oh okay then maybe I can't help you U
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
out of my questions uh representative MC
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
Williams there's an earlier question
 
00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
about the incentivizing consumers
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
isn't it less of a factor incentivized
 
00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
purchase of sevs for those who seek 150
 
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
plus miles per gallon equivalent such as
 
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:40.549 --> 00:42:40.559 align:start position:0%
provides that sounds accurate but I
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
don't claim to be an expert on
 
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
this okay uh second question followup
 
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
yes please thank you this sounds like a
 
00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
bill that would give our dealers the
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
same Market access as States that have
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
adopted the 177
 
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
standards would I have had a greater
 
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
choice in New Hampshire Market had I
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
access to the same zevs that are being
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
Mark made available to our neighboring
 
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:09.559 align:start position:0%
states that have already subscribed to
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
the 177
 
00:43:11.119 --> 00:43:14.109 align:start position:0%
the 177
standards

00:43:14.109 --> 00:43:14.119 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:43:16.589 --> 00:43:16.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you without doubt point
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
of order thank you what is your point of
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
order um you mentioned that
 
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
representative mner is s sitting to your
 
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
left has he taken over minutes because
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
I've been scrivening away here not yet
 
00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just getting in not yet maybe he'll
 
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
take over at the next public hearing if
 
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
you could complete this one we'd
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate that representative thank
 
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
you okay um representative mgee has a
 
00:43:47.069 --> 00:43:47.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
speak thank you Mr chairman uh and thank
 
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
you representative MC Williams for
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I read in a recent
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
Energy report report that the estimate
 
00:43:59.790 --> 00:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
for uptaking New Hampshire of electric
 
00:44:01.549 --> 00:44:01.559 align:start position:0%
vehicles in the next decade would be
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
around 177,000 vehicles and I'm curious
 
00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:08.839 align:start position:0%
uh so it's basically you know um uh
 
00:44:11.069 --> 00:44:11.079 align:start position:0%
forecasting what they think the demand
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
will be for people buying these new
 
00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
types of vehicles and then you testified
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
about how the major car manufacturers
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
actually have set targets now for when
 
00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
they will stop creating combustion
 
00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
vehicles and really convert to all
 
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
so I guess my question is how does this
 
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
bill support and I'm a co-sponsor but I
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
still think you can answer this better
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
than I could uh how does this bill
 
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
support uh those folks who are clearly
 
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
seeking these
 
00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh and as others have said
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
is so that's a really interesting
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
statistic that you bring up I think you
 
00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.470 align:start position:0%
statistic that you bring up I think you
said

00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
177,000 yes um that's a f fairly low
 
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
number um the working numbers that we
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
have from the last time um we went
 
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
through this sort of Bill research and
 
00:45:07.549 --> 00:45:07.559 align:start position:0%
presentation process with Dees um was
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
approximately 1.4 million cars in New
 
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's the existing Fleet
 
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
numbers that we've been using for annual
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
registrations of vehicles in New
 
00:45:20.589 --> 00:45:20.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so 177,000 out of 1.4
 
00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:22.839 align:start position:0%
million is just a drop in the bucket you
 
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
know we only have 1.3 million people in
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so obviously we've got
 
00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:29.720 align:start position:0%
some two three four car households um
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
but 177,000 is super low um I mentioned
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
earlier that the industry is now
 
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
shifting we we've gotten over that hump
 
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
that hurdle that required cash on the
 
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
hood to change Behavior because the
 
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
manufacturers Ford Volkswagen group GM
 
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
and mercedesbenz have all made
 
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
commitments to go electric which is
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
great um so now what we're talking about
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
is trying to make sure that people can
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
test drive those vehicles um I I will
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
pull up the data and send an email to
 
00:45:59.710 --> 00:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
the committee because I think it's
 
00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
important that you understand that the
 
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
the numbers are super high of people who
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
actually have an opportunity to test
 
00:46:09.549 --> 00:46:09.559 align:start position:0%
drive an electric vehicle who actually
 
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
do purchase so getting them behind the
 
00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
wheel to try it out is really important
 
00:46:16.829 --> 00:46:16.839 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the goals here is to
 
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
just increase the supply on dealer Lots
 
00:46:20.829 --> 00:46:20.839 align:start position:0%
so that that can
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
happen I think you know I may this may
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
have been misleading because honestly
 
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative McGee do you need a
 
00:46:31.549 --> 00:46:31.559 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah it's a followup to what
 
00:46:34.109 --> 00:46:34.119 align:start position:0%
the data that I put up there please make
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
sure it's a question and not a statement
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
you are a co-sponsor in this bill
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
typically we don't allow co-sponsors to
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
to ask questions so make it those rules
 
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
at the beginning and you I thought you
 
00:46:46.349 --> 00:46:46.359 align:start position:0%
had changed that Mr chairman he asked
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
that question at the beginning and you
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
said that they would be able to well
 
00:46:53.069 --> 00:46:53.079 align:start position:0%
time permitting but the problem is we
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
have four more people who want to speak
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
on this bill yeah you can on okay thank
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
you all right so uh everyone who has
 
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
their hand raised has already asked
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
questions so we're going to of this uh
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
um person who's testifying
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams so we're
 
00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:13.880 align:start position:0%
going to move on and uh I'm going to
 
00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
recognize now a member of the public
 
00:47:21.549 --> 00:47:21.559 align:start position:0%
represented himself his name is Gerald
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
and I apologize if I mispronounced this
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh Gerald
 
00:47:28.589 --> 00:47:28.599 align:start position:0%
b or
 
00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:31.559 align:start position:0%
bosel morning belel thank you very much
 
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair my name is charal belel um
 
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
president of Bethlehem New Hampshire and
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh like I said speaking on my behalf um
 
00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
just from my background I have a uh
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
master's degree in theoretical physics
 
00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
and I've been working in a number move a
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
little closer to your microphone or
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah I'll try to speak up a little
 
00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
bit um so I just wanted to speak up for
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
this I'm not necessarily in favor of
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
this bill for a number of reasons and I
 
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
want to keep it brief um I think
 
00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:01.720 align:start position:0%
California rules are probably really
 
00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
good for California uh I do recognize
 
00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
though that there's a different uh type
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
of economy a different type of ecology
 
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
they have large metropolitan areas that
 
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
they have to deal with and I think we
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
don't have quite as
 
00:48:16.349 --> 00:48:16.359 align:start position:0%
many um so especially in some of those
 
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
areas where I live in Bethlehem we do
 
00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:21.079 align:start position:0%
have um different needs for cars we
 
00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
don't need U that many zero emission or
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
low emission vehicles but Trucks Than
 
00:48:28.109 --> 00:48:28.119 align:start position:0%
SUVs and I fear that they could get more
 
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
expensive down the road um I think
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
there's also something that concerns me
 
00:48:35.549 --> 00:48:35.559 align:start position:0%
generally um which is a dependence on
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
other states Regulators so if California
 
00:48:40.109 --> 00:48:40.119 align:start position:0%
decides to make changes or um adjust
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
stuff it feels odds that uh our
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
regulations would automatically change
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
by that with little or no oversight from
 
00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
what we're doing we could obviously opt
 
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
out of the program again but that would
 
00:48:52.589 --> 00:48:52.599 align:start position:0%
introduce a lot of increased uncertainty
 
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
I guess um I think there's um some
 
00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
concern for me about the cost um we
 
00:48:59.549 --> 00:48:59.559 align:start position:0%
already see some implementation cost
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
some additional Staffing um there's an
 
00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
un it's unclear um to what extent
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
there's U um additional third party
 
00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
Services um what that cost would look
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
like uh I think there will be uh likely
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
secondary costs in the form of
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
implementation costs for the businesses
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
um potentially increases in the car
 
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
prices uh we may see like a shift from
 
00:49:25.549 --> 00:49:25.559 align:start position:0%
out of state um um buyers that could ALS
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
Ely end up not buying quite as much in
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because our car prices are
 
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:31.160 align:start position:0%
going up and honestly it's like there's
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
a 15% increase in sticker cost um that
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
is also already called out in the um in
 
00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
the um thing as well and I'm just
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
thinking it's like during the Fairly
 
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
tough Economic Times we're in right now
 
00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
I don't see that this is necessarily the
 
00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
right time to start going into a regime
 
00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
where we increase the cost for our
 
00:49:52.829 --> 00:49:52.839 align:start position:0%
businesses and for our citizens across
 
00:49:55.549 --> 00:49:55.559 align:start position:0%
the board so I'm worried about that and
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
then lastly um the benefits seem to me
 
00:49:59.309 --> 00:49:59.319 align:start position:0%
is like based on what I've been hearing
 
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
in readings like really not that uh
 
00:50:03.549 --> 00:50:03.559 align:start position:0%
instrumental yes we may be some of the
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
dealers May uh get a little bit higher
 
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
on the pecking order for certain
 
00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:08.559 align:start position:0%
vehicles but generally speaking those
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles have been available to uh to
 
00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents across the board
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
and to the dealers as well like like I
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
said maybe not quite as much as we would
 
00:50:20.109 --> 00:50:20.119 align:start position:0%
like them to be but um that's true for
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
other models as well if I want a certain
 
00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
specific model of a car then I may have
 
00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
to get out of state in order to get that
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
as well as well so it's like it's not
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
only true for these but it's like a true
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
across the board and generally speaking
 
00:50:31.549 --> 00:50:31.559 align:start position:0%
it's like just looking at the kind of
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
progress we've made based on voluntary
 
00:50:35.309 --> 00:50:35.319 align:start position:0%
or the federal econ standards I think
 
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
over the last 20 30 years uh the
 
00:50:40.349 --> 00:50:40.359 align:start position:0%
emissions from noxious gases and uh
 
00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases have gone down quite
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
significantly despite us traveling a lot
 
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
more when without our cars and having a
 
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
lot more traffic on the roads uh final
 
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
thing I just want to say is like I'm not
 
00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
sure that emulating California or
 
00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:55.480 align:start position:0%
adopting California regulations is uh
 
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
particularly good thing to do uh we
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
seeing that the overregulation that
 
00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
California has been promoting has led to
 
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
uh companies and uh citizens leaving the
 
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
state so it's like I'm fearing that
 
00:51:08.349 --> 00:51:08.359 align:start position:0%
similar things could happen to us if we
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
just follow that kind of model in
 
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:11.720 align:start position:0%
general I think it's best to leave the
 
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
decision on what to buy and what to
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
offer to the citizens to the businesses
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
and the manufacturers and not interfere
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
with this because the market seem to be
 
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
doing quite well in terms of regulating
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
as long as there's some broad General
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
guidelines and uh again it's like I
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
think California is like not really
 
00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:29.240 align:start position:0%
great uh to emulate from energy policy
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
in general it's like they have rolling
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh brownouts they have electricity
 
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
shortages and uh like I said companies
 
00:51:39.069 --> 00:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
leaving I would rather not see emulate
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
bill okay thank you Mr boel for your
 
00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
testimony are there questions for
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
representative B I mean for Mr
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
boel uh representative Bernardi I think
 
00:52:02.349 --> 00:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
question uh you made some very
 
00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
interesting comments and I'm interesting
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
interested if you have done the analysis
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
of uh how much the electric rates or the
 
00:52:17.789 --> 00:52:17.799 align:start position:0%
electric demand would go up if we
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
implemented this how much more
 
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
additional electricity would we need to
 
00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
have available in New
 
00:52:26.349 --> 00:52:26.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire un I have not done that
 
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
research but uh I'd be more than happy
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
to sit down and look hard at that
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
afterwards if it's of Interest I'll
 
00:52:32.559 --> 00:52:35.870 align:start position:0%
afterwards if it's of Interest I'll
Circle

00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
back any
 
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
followup okay any other questions uh
 
00:52:45.069 --> 00:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
seeing none we'll move to our next uh
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
testifier who will
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
be Nicholas Thomas a member of the
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
public uh representing himself Mr Thomas
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
there okay in that case we'll move on
 
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
to um the next speaker who is Joseph
 
00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
kwasnik a member of the public
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
representing himself Mr kwasnik you're
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
recognized to
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
speak thank you Mr chairman can you hear
 
00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:26.990 align:start position:0%
speak thank you Mr chairman can you hear
me

00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:29.240 align:start position:0%
yes uh today I'm providing oral
 
00:53:32.829 --> 00:53:32.839 align:start position:0%
testimony in support of House Bill 168
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
and the reason for my support is that um
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
as we've heard today okay now we can't
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
hear you uh at least very very softly
 
00:53:41.309 --> 00:53:41.319 align:start position:0%
you need to speak up move closer to the
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
mic or do something to uh make yourself
 
00:53:46.829 --> 00:53:46.839 align:start position:0%
heard can you hear me better
 
00:53:46.839 --> 00:53:49.270 align:start position:0%
heard can you hear me better
now

00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
no can you hear me
 
00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:55.640 align:start position:0%
now that's a little bit better I'm sorry
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
um not sure what the technical issues
 
00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
are uh can you hear Let me at least try
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
to give my testimony and if it doesn't
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
work I'll it
 
00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:08.200 align:start position:0%
offline okay um as you've heard today uh
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
both levs and zevs will uh reduce
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
tailpipe emissions both in increasing
 
00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
the health of our citizens in New
 
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and also reducing more
 
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:19.480 align:start position:0%
traditional tailpipe emissions that
 
00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:20.270 align:start position:0%
traditional tailpipe emissions that
cause

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
cause
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
smog recent Studies have shown that um
 
00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
levs and zevs are are less expensive to
 
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
own and operate over the lifetime
 
00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
relative gas and diesel fueled options
 
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
in fact studies indicate that Vehicles
 
00:54:35.349 --> 00:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
these vehicles save consumers between
 
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
$200 and $1,300 just in fuel costs alone
 
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
uh in these studies uh as we pointed out
 
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
before 14 states have already adopted
 
00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
these standards and they surround New
 
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire within New England and
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
Northeastern United States and finally
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh adoption these standards will improve
 
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
the overall health of our citizens of
 
00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire let's do something to
 
00:54:58.030 --> 00:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
protect our citizens and ensure that our
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
environment is cleaner and remains
 
00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:01.480 align:start position:0%
attractive to our tourist and
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
recreational industry many of these
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
tailpipe emissions create smog which
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
causes visibility issues within the high
 
00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:10.839 align:start position:0%
peaks of New Hampshire and I know that
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
um unable to see the high peaks will
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
certainly divert tourists to other
 
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
states that are actually adopt this
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
legislation I thank you for the time
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
today and hope you'll um vote in favor
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
of this legislation thank
 
00:55:27.309 --> 00:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr Quik any questions for
 
00:55:27.319 --> 00:55:29.190 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr Quik any questions for
Mr

00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
kwasnik before we move on to our next
 
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
speaker I have a couple of uh oh I see a
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
hand up from representative C pitz would
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
you like to ask a
 
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
unmute yes please um Mr quic one of the
 
00:55:53.309 --> 00:55:53.319 align:start position:0%
concerns that I have is that electric
 
00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
vehicles are fine and I have actually
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
driven one
 
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
uh the cost and the
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um is that a problem in
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire particularly New Hampshire
 
00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
because in order to drive these vehicles
 
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
we have to charge them somehow so is
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
this a little bit
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
premature uh a very good question uh a
 
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
couple of things that to points to point
 
00:56:25.390 --> 00:56:25.400 align:start position:0%
out here is that um electric vehicles uh
 
00:56:27.549 --> 00:56:27.559 align:start position:0%
their emissions is equivalent to what
 
00:56:29.829 --> 00:56:29.839 align:start position:0%
the um what the emissions are for our
 
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
our system power that's supplied through
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
the region of iso New England so a point
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
there is that system gets cleaner then
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
the emissions associated with
 
00:56:41.029 --> 00:56:41.039 align:start position:0%
electricity generated to supply for
 
00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
those Vehicles goes down so they get
 
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
cleaner over time but also importantly
 
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles are part of the
 
00:56:49.029 --> 00:56:49.039 align:start position:0%
strategy in electric distribution
 
00:56:51.069 --> 00:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
companies New Hampshire as part of their
 
00:56:53.789 --> 00:56:53.799 align:start position:0%
time of use rates in other words what
 
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
the utilities like to do is actually
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
shift the load from these electric
 
00:56:59.870 --> 00:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles to the evening or off peak
 
00:57:02.029 --> 00:57:02.039 align:start position:0%
hours where you actually have um
 
00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
sufficient Supply in fact more more
 
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:06.200 align:start position:0%
Supply than you need so these actually
 
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:07.640 align:start position:0%
would be part of the strategy Within
 
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
These companies to utilize these to
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
actually reduce load and in many cases
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
um some of the more forward-thinking
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
people in this industry see them as
 
00:57:18.029 --> 00:57:18.039 align:start position:0%
actually supplying energy uh during
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
times when there's not enough Supply so
 
00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
they also could be part of What's called
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
the spinning Reserve so they actually
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
will be beneficial for our utility
 
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
system going
 
00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
forward thank you thank you okay before
 
00:57:33.789 --> 00:57:33.799 align:start position:0%
we move on to our next speaker I have a
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
couple of uh I neglected to make a
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
couple of announcements uh earlier the
 
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
first announcement is that the members
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
of the committee who are in the
 
00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
Legislative Office Building are in a
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
different room today we're in the
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
finance committee room which is rooms
 
00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:55.640 align:start position:0%
210 and 211 we're not in rooms 202 203
 
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
where we've been the last two meetings
 
00:57:59.789 --> 00:57:59.799 align:start position:0%
so if it looks different to you on
 
00:58:02.349 --> 00:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
screen that's because it is the other
 
00:58:04.349 --> 00:58:04.359 align:start position:0%
thing that I forgot to mention earlier
 
00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:08.200 align:start position:0%
is that for this bill in particular
 
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
representative uh uh excuse me U
 
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
Department of uh air division um leader
 
00:58:21.069 --> 00:58:21.079 align:start position:0%
Mike Fitzgerald is here today and he's
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
available to answer questions if anybody
 
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
has any uh and I apologize to Mr

mention that earlier so with that said
 
00:58:33.789 --> 00:58:33.799 align:start position:0%
we'll move on to our uh final speaker

00:59:14.029 --> 00:59:14.039 align:start position:0%
and every um community so I will be
 
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
brief um and I'll also try and answer
 
00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
some of the questions or comments that
 
00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:23.240 align:start position:0%
I've heard um we once again uh similar
 
00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
to as we did last year we oppose HB 168
 
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
but as written and our proposal once
 
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
again is that uh St committee consider
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
creating a legislative study Commission
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
on this bill on this issue to further
 
00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
explore the possibility of creating a
 
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
successful New Hampshire solution for
 
00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
the adoption of a z vehicle emission
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
standard we worked with the sponsor last
 
00:59:53.710 --> 00:59:53.720 align:start position:0%
year as well as Department of
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
and nescom and others when the bill was
 
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
originally filed however some of our
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
concerns still remain unresolved which
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
is why we again request uh that the bill
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
uh the issue be made into a study
 
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
commission so for a successful
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
program Emerging Markets like this need
 
01:00:17.029 --> 01:00:17.039 align:start position:0%
to be pulled not pushed incentives work
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
you have to grow demand some of you all
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
may remember Cash for Clunkers in New
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire had the highest
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
take rate per cap
 
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
Nationwide in Cash for Clunkers because
 
01:00:31.029 --> 01:00:31.039 align:start position:0%
there was an incentive program all of
 
01:00:33.789 --> 01:00:33.799 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states have incentive
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
programs even Rhode Island which doesn't
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
really does because they have a state
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
Fleet mandate for EVS so that is the
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
incentive there when Georgia repealed
 
01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
their incentive program sales of their
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
EVS plummeted
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
83% when Massachusetts was on the brink
 
01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
of repealing theirs they had the highest
 
01:00:57.309 --> 01:00:57.319 align:start position:0%
take rate because
 
01:01:01.069 --> 01:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
customers car buyers saw that that
 
01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
demand going away plugin America is the
 
01:01:07.069 --> 01:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
largest ev Advocate Group in the US last
 
01:01:09.309 --> 01:01:09.319 align:start position:0%
week they released a report on the top
 
01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
25 States for EVS
 
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
Nationwide New Hampshire was number 15 I
 
01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
I think that's a great um a great stat
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
however to quote from the report that
 
01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
was just published last week an EV
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
incentive is among the most effective
 
01:01:28.349 --> 01:01:28.359 align:start position:0%
Ive means of increasing EV adoption and
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
each of the states in the top 10
 
01:01:34.029 --> 01:01:34.039 align:start position:0%
featured a purchase
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
incentive so uh again
 
01:01:40.109 --> 01:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
our our request for a study commission
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
is is in the hopes of a successful
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
program and without some type of Market
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
incentive this will not be an a
 
01:01:49.079 --> 01:01:50.589 align:start position:0%
incentive this will not be an a
successful

01:01:50.589 --> 01:01:50.599 align:start position:0%
successful
 
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:53.720 align:start position:0%
program uh to address he or sell what
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
customers want
 
01:01:58.029 --> 01:01:58.039 align:start position:0%
so they do swaps and trades on a daily
 
01:02:02.029 --> 01:02:02.039 align:start position:0%
basis they can get vehicles um in all
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
makes models trims uh whatever the power
 
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
source happens to be they they they
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
trade on constantly
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
um so uh a couple other things I I'll
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
mention real quick um vehicle credit at
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
the time of delivery by the manufacturer
 
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
really is an unfair uh way of handling
 
01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
it and it doesn't really help the the
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
true go emissions reductions if if
 
01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
that's what this uh the goal of this is
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
just because they're delivered to the
 
01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
dealer um and the credit is issued
 
01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean the vehicle is on the road
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
and that's where the emissions reduction
 
01:02:40.589 --> 01:02:40.599 align:start position:0%
comes from so uh this should really be
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
at the time of registration program not
 
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
the time of delivery to reduce emissions
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
just because it lands in New Hampshire
 
01:02:50.109 --> 01:02:50.119 align:start position:0%
but it's back lotted doesn't help with
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh emissions reductions in air quality
 
01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
and health issues so uh I offer that
 
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
um as as something to be considered um
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
if the committee does in fact decide to
 
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
do a study commission
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
um you know something I heard before
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
just to answer you know this is in fact
 
01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
a penalty system you know if the
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
manufacturer doesn't deliver the vehicle
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
to the state based on a proportion or a
 
01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:20.039 align:start position:0%
percentage they pay a fine so it is in
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
fact a penalty system um some of the
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
things that should be analyzed you know
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
through this is we have no idea what
 
01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
this is going to do in the road toll so
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
our gas tax this have a longterm
 
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
analysis and the health of our road tool
 
01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:37.039 align:start position:0%
should be conducted uh analysis of the
 
01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:38.839 align:start position:0%
manufacturers production schedules
 
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
should be performed um they've stated
 
01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
electrification goals and long-term
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
goals but in the short term in 2024
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
2025 it's unclear whether we can meet
 
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
whether those production goals will even
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
be um will be met we asked last time
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
when we looked at to to look at some of
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
the state Fleet numbers um so that we
 
01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
have a clearer picture of what it is
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
that we're committing to in 2023 are we
 
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:07.720 align:start position:0%
committing to go from 700 vehicles to
 
01:04:11.269 --> 01:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
1,700 or 700 vehicles to
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
7,000 and whether the manufacturer can
 
01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
meet those goals so
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
um as mentioned a legislative study
 
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
commission um really I think would be an
 
01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate step it should include the
 
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
legislature Dees
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
do uh the office strategic initiatives
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission about
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
electricity demand uh next time we be on
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
ourselves um and importantly the vehicle
 
01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to continue discussion to
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
explore the potential but to come up
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
with a successful program and that's
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
what we're stating here so um with that
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
I will uh end my test testimony other
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
than just to answer one other quick
 
01:04:58.269 --> 01:04:58.279 align:start position:0%
question I heard from representative
 
01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
Cali pittz regarding tailpipe testing in
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we don't tailpipe tests
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
when we made the uh agreement with the
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
APA multiple years back in Le of
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
tailpipe testing in our um more
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
polluting counties what the state agreed
 
01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
to was to do OBD2 which is onward
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
diagnostic testing um
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
Statewide uh and it's actually a
 
01:05:28.269 --> 01:05:28.279 align:start position:0%
thorough uh check of the emission system
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
as a whole it can actually detect
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
whether you have a loose uh a loose uh
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
fuel cap as opposed to just testing at
 
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
the tailpipe the muffler as well so
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
that's why we arrived at OBD2 testing
 
01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
Statewide in New Hampshire so um other
 
01:05:44.829 --> 01:05:44.839 align:start position:0%
than that thank you for your time I know
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
I moved through rather
 
01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
quickly that's our uh our stand on HP
 
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
168 and if there are any questions I
 
01:05:55.269 --> 01:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
will attempt to um to answer them and if
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
I can't I'll get back to the committee
 
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
answers okay thank you for your
 
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
testimony the chair recognizes
 
01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas for a
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:13.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr Ben for taking my question um I
 
01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
apologize your testimony came over very
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
fuzzy here and I really didn't catch a
 
01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
lot of it so I apologize if I'm asking
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
something that you may have already said
 
01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
but my question
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
is if there was a large demand here in
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
this state for these
 
01:06:36.269 --> 01:06:36.279 align:start position:0%
vehicles what is preventing the
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturers from offering incentives
 
01:06:42.109 --> 01:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
like they do with other vehicles to sell
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
more of of those cars could you explain
 
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
please uh yeah I mean I'll do I'll do my
 
01:06:52.589 --> 01:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
best the the one thing I'll say is
 
01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturers make cars dealers sell
 
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
cars so dealers sell what the customers
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
want and they Source their vehicle Fleet
 
01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
based on demand New Hampshire has a
 
01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
higher take rate of pickup trucks so
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
dealers stock their Lots with more
 
01:07:11.269 --> 01:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
pickup trucks than say commute or
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
passenger sedans so uh the dealers sell
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
and and Market their product based on
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
what their customer base wants and
 
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
desires follow up follow up uh thank you
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so uh to paraphrase I believe
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
what you just said are are you to to
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
clarify are you saying that the dealers
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
here in the state don't see the demand
 
01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
for these vehicles and so therefore uh
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
they're not getting incentives to sell
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
more of them is that what you're
 
01:07:47.549 --> 01:07:47.559 align:start position:0%
saying well dealers see the demand and
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
when they do they go out if they don't
 
01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
have that vehicle they easily go out and
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
Swap and obtain that vehicle
 
01:07:56.589 --> 01:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
from a dealership that does whether it's
 
01:07:59.549 --> 01:07:59.559 align:start position:0%
in state or whether it's cross state
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
borders swaps And Trades happen on a
 
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
daily basis whether it's for an electric
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
vehicle or whether it's for uh the
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
Harley-Davidson Edition for that
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
150 thank
 
01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
you the chair recognizes representative
 
01:08:18.749 --> 01:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
nter for a question thank you Mr
 
01:08:20.110 --> 01:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking the
 
01:08:22.349 --> 01:08:22.359 align:start position:0%
question I was struggling with the with
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
the audio quality as well
 
01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
uh if you haven't done so already could
 
01:08:31.789 --> 01:08:31.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
testimony yes and I apologize for the
 
01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
audio quality represent I will certainly
 
01:08:38.789 --> 01:08:38.799 align:start position:0%
get written copy of my testimony to the
 
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
committee um again uh emphasizing that
 
01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
our request for 168 uh be formed into a
 
01:08:45.719 --> 01:08:48.749 align:start position:0%
our request for 168 uh be formed into a
study

01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:48.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
commission you need a followup okay uh
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
next up then is representative
 
01:08:59.149 --> 01:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
cran thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
Bennett for taking my question um so you
 
01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned a few times that you were
 
01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
eager to have a successful program uh
 
01:09:08.669 --> 01:09:08.679 align:start position:0%
established can you just tell me a
 
01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
little bit about what your criteria for
 
01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:19.269 --> 01:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
like yeah well I mean one some of the
 
01:09:20.669 --> 01:09:20.679 align:start position:0%
things I mentioned and I'm sorry if it
 
01:09:22.349 --> 01:09:22.359 align:start position:0%
didn't come across the successful
 
01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
program would have to do with analysis
 
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
of the impact on the road toll analysis
 
01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:28.759 align:start position:0%
of what our vehicle Fleet would look
 
01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
like and as you know history and other
 
01:09:36.269 --> 01:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
states have shown a a mandate such as
 
01:09:39.269 --> 01:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
this that does not have an incentive
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
does not set up a program for success I
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
mean we knew it was fa right that's why
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
we put more panels on rooftops we have
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
incentive programs emerging like this
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
they need to be pulled along and the way
 
01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
that you pull that along is through
 
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
incentive programs and that's what
 
01:09:59.229 --> 01:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
creates Success New Jersey has a very
 
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
robust program do you know why they put
 
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
$55,000 on the hood of the car to the
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
customer to incent those Vehicles other
 
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
states that do they have HOV lanes and
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles get access even with
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
solo drivers to those those HOV lanes so
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh innovative ways uh and it's not just
 
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
always as mentioned you know dollars on
 
01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
the hood but Innovative incentive
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
programs so that the programs can be
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
successful so that these vehicles make
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
it out into the market and and and
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
they're driven the same way we do with
 
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
the example I use is we put more panels
 
01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:40.950 align:start position:0%
the example I use is we put more panels
on

01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.470 align:start position:0%
 
roofs

01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
roofs
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
answer so so just to clarify you would
 
01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
be in favor of an incentive program
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
where the state of New Hampshire was
 
01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
providing dollars to customers for adop
 
01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:57.229 align:start position:0%
providing dollars to customers for adop
these

01:10:57.229 --> 01:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
vehicles the so I don't want to commit
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
the devil's in the details right but our
 
01:11:05.950 --> 01:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
belief is that if there is an incentive
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
program it's got a much much higher
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
chance of success so if there is a
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
program the incentive
 
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
it uh representative Bernardi is
 
01:11:25.630 --> 01:11:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you Mr chairman uh um so
 
01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:32.199 align:start position:0%
and thank you speaker if if new hampire
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
has more uh EVS than both Vermont and
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
Maine who already have this program how
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we don't hence the need for or
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
our request or belief that a study
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
commission is Justified
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
to explore the issue to see whether it
 
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
successful okay thank you the chair
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative pimel for a
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman uh thank
 
01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr benett for being here um I have a
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
question are you familiar with the uh EV
 
01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.950 align:start position:0%
question are you familiar with the uh EV
and

01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh L vehicle sales in are surrounding
 
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
program basically the question is do you
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
know how they're doing with this with
 
01:12:35.679 --> 01:12:36.510 align:start position:0%
know how they're doing with this with
this

01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
effect I mean one statistic that we've
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
talked about before and I believe maybe
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
one of the agencies that's listening in
 
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
could weigh in on it is is that we
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
basically have equal to the EV
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
registration as main does
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
don't okay thank you
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
Vermont I don't know about the Vermont
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
statistics what I do know again I go
 
01:13:09.669 --> 01:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
back to is that Vermont has an incentive
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
program to to you know financially
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
incentivize and get more Vehicles out on
 
01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.310 align:start position:0%
incentivize and get more Vehicles out on

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:17.320 align:start position:0%

question thank you Mr chair Mr Bennett
 
01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
you mentioned speak closely to the
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%

thank you and Believe on now thank you
 
01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you Mr you had mentioned
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
this study
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
commission here for incentives my
 
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
question is should there be a study
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
incentive how to get
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to provide vehicles to the
 
01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank so um I apologize the question was
 
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
was um very tough to hear but I think
 
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
what you're asking is whether the study
 
01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
committee would look at manufacturers
 
01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
providing the vehicles to the
 
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
dealerships um and if
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
so if that if that is in fact a question
 
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
our belief is that the manufacturers
 
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly should be part of of the
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
study commission um to offer input and
 
01:15:01.229 --> 01:15:01.239 align:start position:0%
insight as to what even more production
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
volume will be um and whether we have
 
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
these targeted goals of X percentage of
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
vehicles on the road whether they can
 
01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
even make so

01:15:21.870 --> 01:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
F150s uh or rivan for that matter uh
 
01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
that that Fleet targets could be
 
01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:28.280 align:start position:0%
obtained so yes just like um some of the
 
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
regulatory agencies that I mentioned
 
01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
Dees nsom do uh the dealers and the
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
manufacturers should be part of that
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
study commission
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
forward okay next up the chair
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative ssuch for a
 
01:15:52.199 --> 01:15:54.950 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative ssuch for a
question

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Bennett for taking my question um
 
01:16:01.629 --> 01:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
just to clarify if if you like you
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned about the swapping of vehicles
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
um if I decide to look for a Zev vehicle
 
01:16:10.590 --> 01:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and the local
 
01:16:13.629 --> 01:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
dealership gets me that vehicle from
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
another state and I purchased that
 
01:16:19.629 --> 01:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
vehicle in light of the fact that we're
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
not part of this California Arrangement
 
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
do I still get the extended warranty
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh thank you for the question
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
ref of s uh I don't believe you do
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
because the state of the Hampshire is
 
01:16:42.629 --> 01:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
not uh has not adopted the California
 
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
apply so uh follow up follow up go ahead
 
01:16:57.149 --> 01:16:57.159 align:start position:0%
yes so to clarify I wouldn't get that
 
01:16:57.159 --> 01:16:58.430 align:start position:0%
yes so to clarify I wouldn't get that
extended

01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
extended
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
warranty uh but it would get credited to
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts dealership as far as
 
01:17:06.510 --> 01:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
having sold that vehicle is that
 
01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.390 align:start position:0%
having sold that vehicle is that
correct

01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
well so so uh and thank you for the
 
01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:13.639 align:start position:0%
question two-part question coming there
 
01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
so one you as the New Hampshire resident
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
I don't believe um and department
 
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
environmental servic maybe this credit
 
01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
would not get that warranty however the
 
01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
credit is not issued to the dealership
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
the credit and the penalty is the state
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturer it's at the time of
 
01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
delivery when that Vehicle Manufacturer
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
drops that vehicle on the lot of the
 
01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
they get the the the credit it's a uh
 
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
it's a delivery credit it's not a sale
 
01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
credit okay thank you very much thank
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
you the chair recognizes representative
 
01:17:57.390 --> 01:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
PL for a
 
01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:05.229 --> 01:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
unmute thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question Mr Bennett if uh the
 
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
Zev and Les are truly competitive why do
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
incentive I I I think the the nature of
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
this of bill is showing that the market
 
01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
is not quite ready and this is this is
 
01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
the way to Spur the market this is the
 
01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
way to grow the the Zev
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
um know zero Mission or uh battery
 
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
hybrid electric vehicle the Beav uh
 
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
market so this is acknowledgement that
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
we're try that the attempt is to try and
 
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
grow the market that's what this program
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
is and so we ain't trying to grow Market
 
01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
you need to pull it along and that's
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
what the incentive does same thing with
 
01:19:00.189 --> 01:19:00.199 align:start position:0%
I take that example that I use Cash for
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
Clunkers we were trying they were trying
 
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
to get dirtier heavier polluted Vehicles
 
01:19:08.590 --> 01:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
off the road what did they do they gave
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
an incentive a tradeing credit get the
 
01:19:13.390 --> 01:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
dirty vehicle a dirtier vehicle off the
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
road will gave you $3,500 to trade it in
 
01:19:18.669 --> 01:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
towards the purchase of a newer cleaner
 
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle and that's when New Hampshire
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
had um
 
01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
PL apparently representative PL is now
 
01:19:41.149 --> 01:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
on the phone so we'll move on uh I have
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
a question for you U Mr
 
01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
Bennett Charlie Baker the governor of
 
01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts recently signed into law a
 
01:19:52.510 --> 01:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
bill that forbids the sale of internal
 
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
combust engine cars after the year
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
2035 although it apparently isn't
 
01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
binding uh I don't know what kind of a
 
01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
law that would be but uh in his uh
 
01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
explanation of the law he suggested that
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts needs to acquire
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
750,000 electric vehicles by the year
 
01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
2035 now that is only 14 years from now
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
and in order for Massachusetts which
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
currently has about 30,000 electric
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
vehicles to get 750,000 Vehicles by 2035
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
51,500 electric vehicles per year for 14
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
years and at an average cost of $50,000
 
01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
a vehicle that would be about $2.5
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
billion do that Massachusetts consumers
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
would have to Fork over to buy these
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
cars that would generate about about
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
$155 million in taxes for the state of
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts my question is doesn't a
 
01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
policy just as the one Massachusetts
 
01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you for the question
 
01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman and I to uh concur with
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
you that I believe that um Governor
 
01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
Baker's announcement was a uh a policy
 
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
statement um I don't believe it was
 
01:21:29.629 --> 01:21:29.639 align:start position:0%
anything that he had signed into law
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
however in looking at those
 
01:21:34.149 --> 01:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts numbers um what I would
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
say is it's it's detailed analysis to
 
01:21:41.310 --> 01:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
see the numbers and the rate and um how
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
quickly and the absorption rate and the
 
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
cost at which that would come to both
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
the state and the citizens uh and that
 
01:21:51.229 --> 01:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
is something that this proposed
 
01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
legislation has not not even done so we
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
don't know what uh that massive number
 
01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
of volume of cost um or purchase level
 
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
by customers to achieve the goals
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
prescribed in the bill to not have the
 
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturers incur penalties that could
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
potentially be cost on passed on to the
 
01:22:16.830 --> 01:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
dealer to raise the cost of vehicles
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
that type of analysis as the
 
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts stuff that you brought up
 
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
has not been done for a New Hampshire
 
01:22:22.159 --> 01:22:23.750 align:start position:0%
has not been done for a New Hampshire
model

01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
model
 
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
which is why our suggestion again is to
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
to slow walk and study it and do that
 
01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:31.470 align:start position:0%
detailed level of
 
01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:33.750 align:start position:0%
detailed level of
[Music]

01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:22:36.030 --> 01:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
analysis thank you my apologies for
 
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
misspeaking it's not legislation it's a
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
plan according to news reports uh the
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
chair now recognizes representative Pim
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
minel for a
 
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
question uh I don't have a hand up do I
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I miss I I meant to say

speaker um a
 
01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
question did I hear right where in the
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
bill did it State there would be a fine
 
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
for not carrying Lev and Zev emission
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
cars I did not see that in the bill did
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
something thank you representative um in
 
01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:21.639 align:start position:0%
section three Roman numeral one and
 
01:23:24.189 --> 01:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral two talks about civil
 
01:23:27.149 --> 01:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
penalties and uh Roman three talks about
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
the funds received from the penalties
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
will be deposited into the motor vehicle
 
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
air pollution abatement fund established
 
01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
in RSA 125 so if the manufacturer does
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
not deliver the prescribed number of
 
01:23:45.629 --> 01:23:45.639 align:start position:0%
vehicles to the
 
01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:48.199 align:start position:0%
state then the Department of
 
01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services is empowered to
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
find the Manu manufacturers for not
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
meeting those delivery
 
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
targets and that's follow you follow
 
01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
up yes please
 
01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
um what would as we are not uh
 
01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
undertaking commissions at this time
 
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
what would your alternative be to
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
creating a study commission to solve
 
01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:20.070 align:start position:0%
creating a study commission to solve
this

01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
problem uh I I if if what the
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
legislature wanted to do was convene an
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
informal ad hoc study commission the way
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
it happened over the summer related to
 
01:24:33.870 --> 01:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
uh zero emissions rules I I assume that
 
01:24:37.950 --> 01:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
might be an opportunity um but a study
 
01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:41.719 align:start position:0%
commission uh you know and our belief
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
and our advocacy for a study commission
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
as we did last year as we do again this
 
01:24:48.910 --> 01:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
year is the best chance of success to
 
01:24:51.709 --> 01:24:51.719 align:start position:0%
keep the discussion going and moving
 
01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
towards potentially um a a positive
 
01:24:57.629 --> 01:24:57.639 align:start position:0%
result and a successful program so we
 
01:24:59.709 --> 01:24:59.719 align:start position:0%
continue to believe that a study
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
action thank you thank you
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas is recognized for
 
01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:10.229 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas is recognized for
a

01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chair for
 
01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
allowing one more question for me thank
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr Ben from taking this question uh
 
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
this is more of a technical question uh
 
01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
based on an article I I recently read a
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
day or two ago
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
um I seem to recall uh what is your what
 
01:25:28.270 --> 01:25:28.280 align:start position:0%
is your
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
um can you verify or clarify for me the
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
um emissions that we might be saving
 
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
from having EVS in our in our in our
 
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
field here in in our state my uh my
 
01:25:46.510 --> 01:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
readings indicated to me that uh the uh
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
environmental damage that is done in the
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
manufacturer of EVS because of the
 
01:25:53.070 --> 01:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
batteries that they use and so forth
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
that the average EV would have to be
 
01:25:59.709 --> 01:25:59.719 align:start position:0%
used approximately seven years before um
 
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
they'd have a a zero sum can you tell me
 
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
what the expected life Capac expectancy
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
is of an EV and uh here in the state of
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
what people are driving and and and uh
 
01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
comment on that statement that that I
 
01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:16.149 align:start position:0%
comment on that statement that that I
just

01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
made yes and thank you for the question
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas I will uh do my
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
best I am unfamiliar with
 
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
the study that you're
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
referencing um as far
 
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
as uh the emissions reduction um you
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
know per EV uh however that's something
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
that the uh the study commission that
 
01:26:39.390 --> 01:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
we're proposing certainly should review
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
and look at it's one of the reasons
 
01:26:44.910 --> 01:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
we're suggesting uh you know folks from
 
01:26:47.310 --> 01:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
Department of envirment Services and
 
01:26:49.790 --> 01:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
nescom certainly be involved uh those
 
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
are the experts at looking at emissions
 
01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
reductions maret and goals um however I
 
01:26:56.830 --> 01:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
do know according to RL pop which is you
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
know an industry data uh compiler the
 
01:27:03.669 --> 01:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
average life cycle of a vehicle is just
 
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
shy of 12 Years so the average vehicle
 
01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:10.280 align:start position:0%
on the road I believe is like 11.9 11.10
 
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
month old so
 
01:27:16.270 --> 01:27:16.280 align:start position:0%
um that's the age of the average age of
 
01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
vehicles on the road so uh to reference
 
01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
your seven-year number um industry aages
 
01:27:22.679 --> 01:27:25.470 align:start position:0%
your seven-year number um industry aages
about

01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:28.280 align:start position:0%
11 thank
 
01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you we're just about out of
 
01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
time representative uh oxam do you have
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
a very quick question I do thank you
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
very much I I I would ask that that
 
01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
question was just answered could be
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
directed to Mike
 
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald he's been waiting to to
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
provide information on this um related
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
points about
 
01:27:51.119 --> 01:27:57.270 align:start position:0%
points about
emissions

01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:06.189 --> 01:28:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
speak oh don't tell me get stepped out

thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
um uh first I I also would like to send
 
01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
my uh greetings to representative PL and
 
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
best wishes and his continued recovery
 
01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:36.639 align:start position:0%
um and uh uh in response to the uh
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
question that was asked um the
 
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
department has not run specific current
 
01:28:43.629 --> 01:28:43.639 align:start position:0%
specific numbers for this legislation we
 
01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
did provide some
 
01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
information um last year which could be
 
01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
updated um there are there are emissions
 
01:28:53.070 --> 01:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
and environmental benefits
 
01:28:55.950 --> 01:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
um depending on the number of vehicles
 
01:28:59.430 --> 01:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
that would be uh that that are uh are
 
01:29:02.030 --> 01:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
purchased in response to the to the
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
requirements um uh and uh um but I I
 
01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:14.590 --> 01:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
moment uh thank you Mr fitzgeral before
 
01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
we go any further I want
 
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
to open the public hearing on HB 289
 
01:29:25.070 --> 01:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
and then recess that hearing for the
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
time being uh re representative oxam did
 
01:29:35.109 --> 01:29:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%

question don't forget to
 
01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
unmute I just wanted to thank Mike
 
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald for a
 
01:29:55.870 --> 01:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
well wishes I'm off oxygen except for
 
01:29:58.629 --> 01:29:58.639 align:start position:0%
when I'm acting walking actively
 
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise I'm totally off it so I'm
 
01:30:02.910 --> 01:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
making rapid
 
01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
progress okay thank you representative
 
01:30:08.430 --> 01:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
PL uh representative pantel is
 
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:14.830 --> 01:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:30:16.510 --> 01:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
uh Mr
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
Fitzpatrick um I have a question one of
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
the things that came up is that we're
 
01:30:24.189 --> 01:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
putting the cart before the horse as far
 
01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%
as uh trying to get more electric
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles in the state because we have
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
nowhere to charge them and I was just
 
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
wondering where are we as a state as far
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
as charging electric
 
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
vehicles sure um thank you very much for
 
01:30:46.030 --> 01:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
that question representative and uh um
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
the department uh is actively
 
01:30:50.669 --> 01:30:50.679 align:start position:0%
participating in the uh Volkswagen
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
funding uh program with the uh um
 
01:30:56.910 --> 01:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
governor's office of strategic
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
initiative and um that is part of the uh
 
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
uh strategy is to increase the uh number
 
01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
the amount of EV infrastructure in the
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
state currently New Hampshire does lag
 
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh many other um New England states the
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
governor has recognized this and has uh
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
authorize that the full
 
01:31:19.870 --> 01:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
15% that is allowed under the VW
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
agreement be authorized for use of uh in
 
01:31:26.669 --> 01:31:26.679 align:start position:0%
and incentivizing additional EV
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um it's also been
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
recognized as a tourism issue here in
 
01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that many people in the
 
01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
Metro region south of us um uh may or
 
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
may not choose to uh to come here if
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
they have electric vehicles and they
 
01:31:46.990 --> 01:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
want to um uh you know be able to to uh
 
01:31:48.430 --> 01:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
to come to New Hampshire and charge
 
01:31:50.109 --> 01:31:50.119 align:start position:0%
their vehicle and get back home safely
 
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
and get around um many resorts are
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
starting to adopt uh and hotels are
 
01:31:57.669 --> 01:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
starting to adopt technology and have
 
01:31:59.830 --> 01:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
parking spaces for
 
01:32:05.070 --> 01:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
EVS um and um so uh it is it is coming
 
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
along but um we we do uh we do fall
 
01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
us thank you Mr
 
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald follow go ahead okay thank
 
01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr Fitzgerald
 
01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
so on the on the uh public on on the
 
01:32:30.669 --> 01:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
public side
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
um do you know how many charging
 
01:32:37.709 --> 01:32:37.719 align:start position:0%
stations are actually in installed in
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
the state whether they're in uh Bank
 
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
parking lots or hotels or uh whatever
 
01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
you know where we are there on the on
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
that uh I know that we have that
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
information available I can can send it
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
to the committee uh following the
 
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
hearing I don't have it right with me at
 
01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:56.590 align:start position:0%
hearing I don't have it right with me at
the

01:32:56.590 --> 01:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
you okay uh representative ssuch is
 
01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
Mr Fitzgerald uh Mr Fitzgerald um can
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
you confirm the fact that there are
 
01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
there there are at least uh some models
 
01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
out there that are zero emission that
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
operate on hydrogen and not just
 
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
EVs and a second question I have is
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
regarding the penalties in this bill um
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
I believe represent McMill has mentioned
 
01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
that those penalties apply when a
 
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle is
 
01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
delivered uh and doesn't meet the
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
emissions requirements not not that this
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
is a penalty for not delivering such a
 
01:33:47.229 --> 01:33:47.239 align:start position:0%
vehicle is that
 
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
correct um so you had a two-part
 
01:33:53.109 --> 01:33:53.119 align:start position:0%
question there um I guess the response
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
to your first part is there are uh Zev
 
01:33:58.669 --> 01:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
vehicles um that that are hydrogen
 
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
they're very advanced technology
 
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
vehicles and I believe there's extremely
 
01:34:05.790 --> 01:34:05.800 align:start position:0%
limited supply of those um again those
 
01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
would be directed to other other states
 
01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
if they're available um other states
 
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
that have adopted the uh the Zev program
 
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
um in um your
 
01:34:21.310 --> 01:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh second question I'm sorry could
 
01:34:24.430 --> 01:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
you ask repeat the uh second question
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
you wanted me to confirm something yeah
 
01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
sure the the bill in in this oh the
 
01:34:33.709 --> 01:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
penalties yes um I I believe although I
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to to to look at it
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
overly carefully but I I believe one
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
point to make is that um section 177 of
 
01:34:43.950 --> 01:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
the Clean Air Act only allows New
 
01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to adopt the California
 
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
program um or or other section 177
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
States um a state cannot create a third
 
01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
car program there's either the federal
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
program or the California program and if
 
01:34:59.910 --> 01:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
a state wants to adopt the California
 
01:35:01.950 --> 01:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
program they must adopt it in its
 
01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
entirety with no changes um and uh in
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
particular no changes that would so to
 
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
speak create a third U third type of
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle that the manufacturers would
 
01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
have to to purchase if it had a
 
01:35:19.390 --> 01:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
different warranty requirement or say or
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
something like that so that's one key
 
01:35:24.669 --> 01:35:24.679 align:start position:0%
Point um so whatever penalty Provisions
 
01:35:26.430 --> 01:35:26.440 align:start position:0%
are in the California regulation would
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
be the same as
 
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
those um those here um again to the best
 
01:35:34.350 --> 01:35:34.360 align:start position:0%
of my knowledge no penalties have ever
 
01:35:38.109 --> 01:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
been levied by a by a uh no pen no pun
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
intended L State um and uh uh but the
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
the provisions would be against as I
 
01:35:46.590 --> 01:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
understand that they would be against
 
01:35:50.189 --> 01:35:50.199 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer for failure to deliver
 
01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
the vehicles that were required in a
 
01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
given model
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
year to the
 
01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
state okay thank you Mr Fitzgerald the
 
01:36:03.070 --> 01:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
chair now recognizes representative Tim
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
Lang who is substituting today for
 
01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
langing thank you Mr chair I just want
 
01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
to let you know I've been on a call for
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
a while I am alone I'm in my
 
01:36:21.390 --> 01:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
car oh okay thank you very much chair
 
01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
recognizes uh representative Bernardi
 
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
question yes uh thank you Mr chairman
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Fitzgerald uh I'm going to
 
01:36:33.790 --> 01:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
go back to uh a question I asked one of
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
the the previous uh speakers is there
 
01:36:41.189 --> 01:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
been an assessment of what the net
 
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
additional Electric Supply would need to
 
01:36:46.629 --> 01:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
be if we adopted this program and move
 
01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
to Electric uh Fleet and the second part
 
01:36:53.390 --> 01:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
of that question given a need for
 
01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
additional production and that that
 
01:36:57.790 --> 01:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
production would likely be in the
 
01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
evening because that's when cars are
 
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
being charged not during the day not
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
when solar is operating but at night
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
what what does that mean for net change
 
01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:09.709 align:start position:0%
what what does that mean for net change
of

01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:37:12.669 --> 01:37:12.679 align:start position:0%
emissions um thank you I I will attempt
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
to answer that question to the best of
 
01:37:16.590 --> 01:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
my ability I think also that's a
 
01:37:19.950 --> 01:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
question perhaps for utilities um that
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
we have not conducted any particular
 
01:37:23.790 --> 01:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
assessment I do believe there's an
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
ongoing conversation in New England and
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
other parts of the country in terms of
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
electric supply um ISO New England
 
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
certainly recognizes the growth in
 
01:37:36.109 --> 01:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles um as Mr kwasnik I
 
01:37:40.589 --> 01:37:40.599 align:start position:0%
believe it was uh mentioned um and um
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
although he did not state so I believe
 
01:37:44.709 --> 01:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
Mr kwasnik used to be um a
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
representative of a a utility used to
 
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
work for a utility um one of new one of
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's utilities um uh as he
 
01:37:54.750 --> 01:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
stated there is um certainly there would
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
be some in increased demand um uh for uh
 
01:38:03.070 --> 01:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
electricity there is also the
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity for electric vehicles to
 
01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
store electricity and for that
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
electricity to be drawn upon at at
 
01:38:11.709 --> 01:38:11.719 align:start position:0%
certain points of time um and I think
 
01:38:15.550 --> 01:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
that that uh um uh as I say ISO New
 
01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
England and uh and the utilities are all
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
studying those opportunities um I I
 
01:38:23.950 --> 01:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
believe there may be some reports that
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh have been done or studies that uh and
 
01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
if I can locate any of those I will
 
01:38:31.390 --> 01:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
forward them on to the
 
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
committee thank you representative C
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
pittz is recognized for a question and
 
01:38:40.990 --> 01:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:43.950 --> 01:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
unmute I'd forget my head if it wasn't
 
01:38:47.189 --> 01:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
attached uh Mr
 
01:38:51.229 --> 01:38:51.239 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald yes do you know or can you
 
01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
tell me where New Hampshire stands right
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
now as far as emissions go among the 50
 
01:39:02.350 --> 01:39:02.360 align:start position:0%
states are we in the M you know in the
 
01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
middle are we on the most missions can
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
you tell us where we stand and I know
 
01:39:10.390 --> 01:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
that's apples and oranges because of
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
populations but where do we stand AB
 
01:39:16.589 --> 01:39:16.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely it is um you know it would be
 
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
impossible for us I think I guess um I I
 
01:39:21.310 --> 01:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
don't have the information with me right
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
now but we I certainly could provide you
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
know where we stand on a per capita
 
01:39:28.270 --> 01:39:28.280 align:start position:0%
basis um in and I assume you're talking
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
about emissions of greenhouse gases um
 
01:39:33.189 --> 01:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
yes okay yeah yeah um I I could
 
01:39:35.629 --> 01:39:35.639 align:start position:0%
certainly try to um follow up with some
 
01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
information on a on a per capita basis
 
01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
that might allow for
 
01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
comparison and one of the thing may I
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
follow up yes you may follow
 
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
up one of the things that I'm
 
01:39:54.669 --> 01:39:54.679 align:start position:0%
concerned about because
 
01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
I is what
 
01:39:57.440 --> 01:39:59.470 align:start position:0%
I is what
happens

01:39:59.470 --> 01:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
happens
 
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
to the revenue we now derive from
 
01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:05.550 align:start position:0%
to the revenue we now derive from
gasoline

01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
gasoline
 
01:40:10.510 --> 01:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
tax if the a major switch is made even
 
01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:11.910 align:start position:0%
tax if the a major switch is made even
in

01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
2030 does anybody thought of that or
 
01:40:17.149 --> 01:40:17.159 align:start position:0%
anybody worked that out Yes actually the
 
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
legislature has been looking that at
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
that for a number of years there have
 
01:40:23.790 --> 01:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
been a number study commissions um uh
 
01:40:26.350 --> 01:40:26.360 align:start position:0%
and actually um I believe representative
 
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
major has uh proposed legislation
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
several times over the past few years
 
01:40:33.310 --> 01:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
which I believe he may have introduced
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
this year as well um that would
 
01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:39.270 align:start position:0%
this year as well um that would
uh

01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:42.109 --> 01:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
um in that is intended to sort of
 
01:40:45.709 --> 01:40:45.719 align:start position:0%
equalize the playing field to uh um
 
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
collect some type of fee from electric
 
01:40:50.589 --> 01:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
vehicles um we've always looked at this
 
01:40:53.589 --> 01:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
as um an equity issue and we've wanted
 
01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
to make make certain that um that any
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
fee um that is based that is intended
 
01:41:06.589 --> 01:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
for that purpose um is based on actual
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
mileage or emissions because um as you
 
01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
well know there may there are certain um
 
01:41:15.629 --> 01:41:15.639 align:start position:0%
internal combustion engine vehicles that
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
actually get better mileage than uh
 
01:41:20.350 --> 01:41:20.360 align:start position:0%
certain types of electric vehicles the
 
01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
the vehicles very widely um but we we
 
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
certainly um uh have always testified
 
01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
and encouraged that there be Equitable
 
01:41:33.709 --> 01:41:33.719 align:start position:0%
representation and that the road toll um
 
01:41:35.709 --> 01:41:35.719 align:start position:0%
if that's New Hampshire's mechanism for
 
01:41:39.390 --> 01:41:39.400 align:start position:0%
continuing to uh pay for infrastructure
 
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh for our for our roads and bridges and
 
01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
so on um that that road toll is going to
 
01:41:45.390 --> 01:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
be affected and whether we do this or
 
01:41:48.109 --> 01:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
not there's going to be um growth in
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles over the next several
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
years as evidenced by the announcements
 
01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
that the major vehicle manufacturers
 
01:41:56.589 --> 01:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
that was referenced by representative MC
 
01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
Williams um and that growth is going to
 
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
occur in New England New Hamp New
 
01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and all across the country
 
01:42:06.270 --> 01:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
um so this is an issue that is is being
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
looked at nationally and certainly um uh
 
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
it hasn't had a major impact now because
 
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
of the relatively low number of vehicles
 
01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:16.639 align:start position:0%
but though there certainly will be an
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
impact to to road toll that is based on
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
gasoline consumption
 
01:42:23.629 --> 01:42:23.639 align:start position:0%
that that impact is occurring right now
 
01:42:26.589 --> 01:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
because mileage is going up on almost
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
all vehicles and um so there certainly
 
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
is uh is a trend and an impact on Lower
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
gasoline usage whether it's electric
 
01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles or other uh or or just more
 
01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
efficient internal combustion vehicles I
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
hope that addresses your question thank
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you and uh seeing that we have
 
01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
no further question questions for um Mr
 
01:42:57.070 --> 01:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald I'm going to close the public
 
01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:58.270 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald I'm going to close the public
hearing

01:42:58.270 --> 01:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:43:01.550 --> 01:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
on I'm sorry to interrupt um but we did
 
01:43:04.350 --> 01:43:04.360 align:start position:0%
have Mr John Gage who did sign up after
 
01:43:06.109 --> 01:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
the Sheets Were printed today he did
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
sign up to speak for two minutes and he
 
01:43:10.149 --> 01:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
is on the
 
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
line okay uh I will call on Mr Gage and
 
01:43:17.229 --> 01:43:17.239 align:start position:0%
I will hold him to two minutes and we
 
01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
will not be uh entertaining any question
 
01:43:24.109 --> 01:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr Gage so Mr Gage you are
 
01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
on for two minutes and I'm starting my
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh stopwatch
 
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
so uh be careful thank you very much uh
 
01:43:39.229 --> 01:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
I'd like to offer my support for HP 168
 
01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
um I disagree with the statement that
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
sale dealers are selling what the
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
customers want from personal experience
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
I um was looking to buy a car two years
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
ago and
 
01:43:53.589 --> 01:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
the I was looking for an electric
 
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle um but dealership after
 
01:43:57.990 --> 01:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
dealership told me that they didn't have
 
01:43:59.149 --> 01:43:59.159 align:start position:0%
uh the models that I've been reading
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
about online and it was because of the
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
what what this bill addresses um the
 
01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
states all around us have um have rules
 
01:44:12.149 --> 01:44:12.159 align:start position:0%
that are getting uh the the newest best
 
01:44:14.350 --> 01:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles on their Lots in New
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't and so um I think we
 
01:44:18.750 --> 01:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
can change consumer Behavior by doing
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
two things um inform them you know
 
01:44:23.550 --> 01:44:23.560 align:start position:0%
dealerships could talk about the cost
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
savings over the life time of the car of
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
an EV over an internal combustion engine
 
01:44:33.030 --> 01:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
and by offering the best vehicles on the
 
01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
Lots instead of customers having to know
 
01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
that oh if they call Mass if they call a
 
01:44:39.910 --> 01:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
dealership and ask you know to have a
 
01:44:41.589 --> 01:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
car brought up from another state then
 
01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:43.679 align:start position:0%
they can test drive it that's really not
 
01:44:45.790 --> 01:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
how most people buy cars they they go to
 
01:44:48.109 --> 01:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
a couple lots and they buy what's there
 
01:44:50.709 --> 01:44:50.719 align:start position:0%
that meets their um you know
 
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
requirements the best um there's unmet
 
01:44:56.350 --> 01:44:56.360 align:start position:0%
demand for EVS um my own case I was
 
01:44:58.390 --> 01:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
looking for an EV and there were a
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
couple that I just couldn't get in the
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
state and I didn't feel like driving uh
 
01:45:04.229 --> 01:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
to other states to to test
 
01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
drive 30 seconds I would say I'd propose
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
that you we change how we fund um road
 
01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:16.719 align:start position:0%
work use um miles driven and the weight
 
01:45:19.470 --> 01:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
of vehicles instead of a gas tax because
 
01:45:22.910 --> 01:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
gas cars are going away whether we help
 
01:45:25.109 --> 01:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
consumers get informed and and choose
 
01:45:27.149 --> 01:45:27.159 align:start position:0%
them early or it happens naturally over
 
01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
time um and I'd also like to invite any
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
of the members of this committee to a
 
01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
meeting um tomorrow morning or Wednesday
 
01:45:39.589 --> 01:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
afternoon Wednesday evening I sent a
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
mail um to offer an explanation about
 
01:45:45.149 --> 01:45:45.159 align:start position:0%
why carbon is such a scientifically
 
01:45:47.350 --> 01:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
identified pollution um I believe
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
there's some members of the committee
 
01:45:52.109 --> 01:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
that may not grasp the the full nature
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
of why our whole okay Mr Gage thank you
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
we appreciate your
 
01:45:59.910 --> 01:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
testimony and with that we're going to

introduce the
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
bill which I will do at this time this
 
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
01:48:09.629 --> 01:48:09.639 align:start position:0%
basically did someone
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
speak point of see if I'm point of order
 
01:48:17.229 --> 01:48:17.239 align:start position:0%
this is representative Fred PL is uh is
 
01:48:18.790 --> 01:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative mner taking over the
 
01:48:21.629 --> 01:48:21.639 align:start position:0%
clerk role I'm ready I'm G to
 
01:48:24.189 --> 01:48:24.199 align:start position:0%
take yes representative mner will take
 
01:48:26.589 --> 01:48:26.599 align:start position:0%
over the clerk role from this point
 
01:48:29.229 --> 01:48:29.239 align:start position:0%
forward and thank you to representative
 
01:48:33.669 --> 01:48:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:40.750 --> 01:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
Bill okay so to introduce uh house Bild
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
289 this is a uh bill that basically is
 
01:48:48.189 --> 01:48:48.199 align:start position:0%
a housekeeping bill that
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
adds an electrical storage
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
facility to the definition of
 
01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh energy facilities it adds a
 
01:49:00.350 --> 01:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
electrical storage facility with a peak
 
01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
storage capacity of 30 megawatts hours
 
01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:04.629 align:start position:0%
storage capacity of 30 megawatts hours
or

01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:04.639 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:49:09.990 --> 01:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
greater uh to the existing statutory
 
01:49:13.109 --> 01:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
definition of uh energy
 
01:49:16.830 --> 01:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
facility uh it's been supported by
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
everyone who signed
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
up um on the blue sheet no one signed up
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
to speak for or against it um and since
 
01:49:29.390 --> 01:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington is not here I
 
01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
don't know if I'll be able to answer any
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
questions but I'll give it a shot
 
01:49:36.510 --> 01:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
representative oxum is recognized for a
 
01:49:39.390 --> 01:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you very much the
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
definition is in terms of megawatt hours
 
01:49:47.189 --> 01:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
whereas other facilities in the um the
 
01:49:51.310 --> 01:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
uh statute are in megaw
 
01:49:55.229 --> 01:49:55.239 align:start position:0%
one is capacity uh one is usage and I
 
01:49:57.589 --> 01:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
wonder if we we had problems with this
 
01:50:00.189 --> 01:50:00.199 align:start position:0%
bill when it was brought up previously
 
01:50:04.910 --> 01:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
and I wonder if this was not caught by
 
01:50:09.310 --> 01:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
OS um I I I think we have a problem here
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
if it's 30 megawatt
 
01:50:14.550 --> 01:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
hours in terms of megawatts it's a
 
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
quarter of that capacity other
 
01:50:19.629 --> 01:50:19.639 align:start position:0%
facilities in this same statute are 30
 
01:50:23.470 --> 01:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
Mega Watts I believe this should be 30
 
01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:27.320 align:start position:0%
megawatts not 30 megawatt hours what
 
01:50:28.910 --> 01:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
what what you're establishing here would
 
01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
be a limit of
 
01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:34.109 align:start position:0%
be a limit of
7.5

01:50:34.109 --> 01:50:34.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
megawatts that's a good point and uh I
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
wish representative Harrington was here
 
01:50:41.709 --> 01:50:41.719 align:start position:0%
to address it but since he is not uh
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
we'll have to hold that question for
 
01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
later representative pel is recognized
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman I I went
 
01:50:55.470 --> 01:50:55.480 align:start position:0%
online looking to see if I could bring
 
01:50:58.950 --> 01:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
up a picture of a 30 megaw
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
hour um uh storage facility um and to to
 
01:51:10.109 --> 01:51:10.119 align:start position:0%
Le Point to represent an ox
 
01:51:15.189 --> 01:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
oxam point they were usually rated in
 
01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
megawatts but still I wasn't able to see
 
01:51:20.910 --> 01:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
anything on size and I guess my question
 
01:51:23.589 --> 01:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
is because this kind of legislation
 
01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
makes sense but I I don't know how big
 
01:51:29.629 --> 01:51:29.639 align:start position:0%
of a facility we are I mean if it's
 
01:51:32.990 --> 01:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
something as big as uh my car for
 
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
instance or even uh a semitruck I'm not
 
01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
I I question whether or not we need it
 
01:51:41.589 --> 01:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
but if this is a big
 
01:51:44.510 --> 01:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
facility uh it makes sense so size is
 
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
important if I could get that kind of an
 
01:51:52.189 --> 01:51:52.199 align:start position:0%
idea thank you okay thank you I um I
 
01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
just recalled that the RSA that's being
 
01:52:01.830 --> 01:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
modified here is RSA 162 which is the uh
 
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
statute that governs the site evaluation
 
01:52:08.430 --> 01:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
committee so what this um bill is
 
01:52:12.390 --> 01:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
actually modifying is the definition of
 
01:52:16.270 --> 01:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
a facility that would require site
 
01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee uh jurisdiction uh
 
01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
if you read the the section H that
 
01:52:28.790 --> 01:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
follows section g it talks about how a
 
01:52:32.030 --> 01:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
facility like this uh can
 
01:52:34.830 --> 01:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
be taken on by the site evaluation
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
committee so I think that is a a clear
 
01:52:41.589 --> 01:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
an important distinction about this bill
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh it it it specifically app applies to
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee uh
 
01:52:53.229 --> 01:52:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:56.709 --> 01:52:56.719 align:start position:0%
did you have a followup yeah I I I I
 
01:52:58.470 --> 01:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
understand what the bill is about and
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
and my followup is whether or not it
 
01:53:01.199 --> 01:53:02.229 align:start position:0%
and my followup is whether or not it
should

01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:53:06.430 --> 01:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
be uh in a go to a site evaluation
 
01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
committee if it's really not you
 
01:53:13.390 --> 01:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
know that honorous of of a I don't know
 
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
how big it is you know what are we
 
01:53:17.950 --> 01:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
talking about for size I I I can
 
01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:20.719 align:start position:0%
understand a site of value valuation
 
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
committee for a a a wind turbine which
 
01:53:30.109 --> 01:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
takes up a lot of area and I guess so
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
that's really the question and I think
 
01:53:36.430 --> 01:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
knowing the size will give me an idea of
 
01:53:38.109 --> 01:53:38.119 align:start position:0%
how I want to vote on
 
01:53:41.470 --> 01:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
this okay without so the issue here so
 
01:53:45.629 --> 01:53:45.639 align:start position:0%
the issue here is if a ail if a a
 
01:53:48.430 --> 01:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
facility is 30 megawatts or greater it
 
01:53:49.870 --> 01:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
automatically goes to the site of
 
01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee if it's 30 megawatt
 
01:53:56.430 --> 01:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
or less or under 30 megawatt it can go
 
01:53:59.589 --> 01:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
to the site evaluation committee only by
 
01:54:05.149 --> 01:54:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
the I think it's the persons who are uh
 
01:54:12.390 --> 01:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
in charge of determining whether the
 
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
facility should be allowed to be built
 
01:54:16.990 --> 01:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
or not uh like a planning board or a
 
01:54:20.550 --> 01:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
zoning board so
 
01:54:22.189 --> 01:54:22.199 align:start position:0%
some towns don't feel they have the
 
01:54:26.350 --> 01:54:26.360 align:start position:0%
expertise to deal with facilities like a
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
u like an in electrical energy storage
 
01:54:32.910 --> 01:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
facility uh facilities um so they want
 
01:54:34.830 --> 01:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee to take
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
that over and this legislation will
 
01:54:40.910 --> 01:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
permit the site evaluation committee to
 
01:54:43.270 --> 01:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
do that for electrical storage
 
01:54:48.149 --> 01:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
facilities uh of 30 megawatt hours or
 
01:54:52.350 --> 01:54:52.360 align:start position:0%
greater so that's the essence of the now
 
01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
I'm remembering my discussion with
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
Michael Harrington about this so that's
 
01:54:59.550 --> 01:54:59.560 align:start position:0%
the essence of the U of the
 
01:55:01.870 --> 01:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
situation uh representative PL is
 
01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
01:55:08.830 --> 01:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:12.510 --> 01:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
unmuted I am um I just wanted to with
 
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
respect to uh represent representative
 
01:55:18.069 --> 01:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
uh Celly pittz concern I think it was
 
01:55:19.990 --> 01:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
Cali Pitts about the May what hours
 
01:55:22.669 --> 01:55:22.679 align:start position:0%
versus megawatts you can discharge this
 
01:55:27.870 --> 01:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:30.270 --> 01:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
megawatts okay uh thank you
 
01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
representative ssuch you're recognized
 
01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman uh I
 
01:55:39.870 --> 01:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
actually uh had actually before you ask
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
your question I apologize for
 
01:55:46.750 --> 01:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
interrupting I have to leave um so I'm
 
01:55:48.910 --> 01:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
not sure who you can direct your
 
01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
question to I have to step out of the
 
01:55:53.229 --> 01:55:53.239 align:start position:0%
room for a half hour or so I have
 
01:55:55.310 --> 01:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
another meeting that I have to conduct
 
01:55:57.149 --> 01:55:57.159 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn the meeting over to
 
01:56:00.830 --> 01:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas and um I won't be
 
01:56:02.990 --> 01:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
here to answer questions but maybe
 
01:56:05.669 --> 01:56:05.679 align:start position:0%
somebody else on the committee can so
 
01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
please okay uh not being familiar uh
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
with talking with represent Harrington
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
on this bill I have no further knowledge
 
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
on any other questions but you can ask
 
01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
your questions and if anybody here in
 
01:56:32.910 --> 01:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
the room can answer that'd be fine uh so
 
01:56:36.430 --> 01:56:36.440 align:start position:0%
let's proceed okay uh thank you Mr
 
01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:39.679 align:start position:0%
chairman uh actually I'm following up on
 
01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
what represent plat just mentioned so I
 
01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
think we got to be clear about this 30
 
01:56:50.790 --> 01:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
megawatts is used to identify a energy
 
01:56:54.270 --> 01:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
generator 30 megawatt hours is an energy
 
01:56:57.629 --> 01:56:57.639 align:start position:0%
storage device meaning like he said if
 
01:57:00.109 --> 01:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
you didn't discharge 30 megawatt of
 
01:57:02.830 --> 01:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
energy within an hour that battery had
 
01:57:06.069 --> 01:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
30 megawatt hours of storage so they
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
have to include ours we can't just say
 
01:57:12.350 --> 01:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
30 megaw that's generation capacity
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
that's not a storage battery so I think
 
01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
that is a difference and I think last
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
year we had a bill that just said 30
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours with 30 megawatts without
 
01:57:31.030 --> 01:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:38.709 --> 01:57:38.719 align:start position:0%
says could could I answer that a what I
 
01:57:41.709 --> 01:57:41.719 align:start position:0%
see here now is I see um I'm not quite
 
01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
sure who was next but I see repres Kelly
 
01:57:46.270 --> 01:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
Pit's hands raised for a
 
01:57:50.069 --> 01:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
question is there anybody in the room uh
 
01:57:51.790 --> 01:57:51.800 align:start position:0%
from a
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
utility because these storage facilities
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
get bigger and bigger and bigger and I'm
 
01:58:03.189 --> 01:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure
 
01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
what representative Harrington had in
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
mind or of the size this isn't a home
 
01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:11.069 align:start position:0%
mind or of the size this isn't a home
storage

01:58:11.069 --> 01:58:11.079 align:start position:0%
storage
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
facility it we're talking about large
 
01:58:14.719 --> 01:58:16.109 align:start position:0%
facility it we're talking about large
large

01:58:16.109 --> 01:58:16.119 align:start position:0%
large
 
01:58:19.470 --> 01:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
facilities that would come under I
 
01:58:24.109 --> 01:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
believe SEC control or SSC SEC
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
permitting so I'm not sure and I I just
 
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
wondered everybody's questions could we
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
postpone that until we actually find out
 
01:58:36.990 --> 01:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
what representative Harrington was
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
intending uh thank you representative I
 
01:58:43.189 --> 01:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
will note I I see that um Donna gamos M
 
01:58:45.390 --> 01:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
source is on a participant line if she
 
01:58:48.069 --> 01:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
would care to comment at all on this uh
 
01:58:50.430 --> 01:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
uh m kamash would you care to comment at
 
01:59:05.990 --> 01:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:10.669 --> 01:59:10.679 align:start position:0%
refrain hear me this is Donna yes um I I
 
01:59:12.350 --> 01:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
we don't really have a position on this
 
01:59:14.510 --> 01:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
bill but um we were taking a look at it
 
01:59:16.830 --> 01:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
you know our lawyers and they they saw
 
01:59:19.310 --> 01:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
that you know this clearly is for larger
 
01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
storage and all we could figure was that
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
potentially um a community was asking
 
01:59:28.589 --> 01:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
that somebody else you know take over
 
01:59:33.830 --> 01:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
the review um we we aren't we aren't
 
01:59:37.069 --> 01:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
we're still trying to get um smaller
 
01:59:38.910 --> 01:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
versions through the Public Utilities
 
01:59:41.629 --> 01:59:41.639 align:start position:0%
Commission so it's not anything that um
 
01:59:43.470 --> 01:59:43.480 align:start position:0%
you know we would have a concern with
 
01:59:46.990 --> 01:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
and even if um the SEC took jurisdiction
 
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
over that it would just be one other um
 
01:59:51.550 --> 01:59:51.560 align:start position:0%
layer of approvals which we typically
 
01:59:55.390 --> 01:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
are used to so um I we're I think that
 
01:59:57.470 --> 01:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
to everybody's point before us that the
 
01:59:59.229 --> 01:59:59.239 align:start position:0%
sole purpose of this is to make sure
 
02:00:00.830 --> 02:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
that if a community doesn't know how to
 
02:00:03.669 --> 02:00:03.679 align:start position:0%
act on it they want the SEC to do so but
 
02:00:05.669 --> 02:00:05.679 align:start position:0%
we don't have an actual position on that
 
02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
we'd have to leave that to the
 
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
communities and to you I don't I I know
 
02:00:12.350 --> 02:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
that was rather vague I hope that was
 
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you
 
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
m representative Thomas I apologize for
 
02:00:18.030 --> 02:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
interrupting I just wanted to let you
 
02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
know that Mr James manahan is on the
 
02:00:22.830 --> 02:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
line and he did request to testify I'm
 
02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
not sure if he can speak to this point
 
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily but his hand is raised if
 
02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
you'd like to recognize him I would like
 
02:00:31.629 --> 02:00:31.639 align:start position:0%
to follow up yeah yes I'll give a follow
 
02:00:33.950 --> 02:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
up to representative uh Cy pittz I did
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
see Mr Monahan's hands raised and I had
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
the same question you did but I'll go to
 
02:00:41.870 --> 02:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
represent Cali pits first go
 
02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
ahead Donna do you have any idea what
 
02:00:50.069 --> 02:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
the size of a seven megawatt hour
 
02:00:51.669 --> 02:00:51.679 align:start position:0%
facility would
 
02:00:56.550 --> 02:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
be or what a 30 megawatt hour would be I
 
02:00:58.109 --> 02:00:58.119 align:start position:0%
would need somebody to do the math for
 
02:01:00.990 --> 02:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
me so I'm sorry probably representative
 
02:01:03.790 --> 02:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
plet would be spoton because he's done
 
02:01:06.589 --> 02:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
this so much I'm not the expert there
 
02:01:08.669 --> 02:01:08.679 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I mean I could have been if I
 
02:01:10.030 --> 02:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
had thought about if I if I knew I was
 
02:01:11.470 --> 02:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
gonna get the question I would have been
 
02:01:13.870 --> 02:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
the expert no I'm kidding what you get
 
02:01:17.709 --> 02:01:17.719 align:start position:0%
for showing up thank you right Mr chair
 
02:01:20.350 --> 02:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
I actually have some specifications here
 
02:01:22.430 --> 02:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
for energy representa you have any
 
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
recognized yet to to speak um if you
 
02:01:28.550 --> 02:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
have I was asking Mr chair I'm asking to
 
02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
go out of turn because I actually have
 
02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:31.990 align:start position:0%
go out of turn because I actually have
some

02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:01:35.790 --> 02:01:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:39.950 --> 02:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
useful uh be brief like a few seconds
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
please sure um for transmission uh
 
02:01:47.189 --> 02:01:47.199 align:start position:0%
purposes energy storage is often in the
 
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
10 megawatt range range for distribution
 
02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
energy storage is often in the 2
 
02:01:57.510 --> 02:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
megawatt range it's generally these
 
02:01:59.629 --> 02:01:59.639 align:start position:0%
batteries discharge for a period of four
 
02:02:01.629 --> 02:02:01.639 align:start position:0%
hours so the difference between your
 
02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
megawatt and your megawatt hours is a
 
02:02:06.589 --> 02:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
factor of four batteries are usually
 
02:02:08.910 --> 02:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
listed with both they specify the
 
02:02:12.550 --> 02:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
megawatts and the megawatt hours um I I
 
02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
think that's probably sufficient for our
 
02:02:17.709 --> 02:02:17.719 align:start position:0%
purposes thank you so much I'm going to
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
go to Mr Monahan now because he has been
 
02:02:24.030 --> 02:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
waiting for a while Mr pan uh if you uh
 
02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
you're on to
 
02:02:31.270 --> 02:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
testify great um thank you um so I I um
 
02:02:33.589 --> 02:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
I think both representatives samitz and
 
02:02:35.709 --> 02:02:35.719 align:start position:0%
oxen him have address the issue of
 
02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not it should be Mega or
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
megga hours based upon the discharge uh
 
02:02:43.270 --> 02:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
and let me just start off by saying Jim
 
02:02:45.910 --> 02:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
an actually supporting the bill on
 
02:02:47.830 --> 02:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
behalf of the New England power
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
generators Association
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
Granite Shore power and revision energy
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
um and answer the question with regard
 
02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
to the size um I do believe a 30
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
megawatt our facility would be sizable
 
02:03:00.629 --> 02:03:00.639 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be in your garage for
 
02:03:02.030 --> 02:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
example I think you could probably look
 
02:03:06.910 --> 02:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
at it like it's um a a substation that
 
02:03:08.270 --> 02:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
you might be familiar with on the side
 
02:03:11.069 --> 02:03:11.079 align:start position:0%
of the road or back of a parking lot um
 
02:03:13.629 --> 02:03:13.639 align:start position:0%
and obviously the bigger they get um the
 
02:03:15.629 --> 02:03:15.639 align:start position:0%
larger the substation comparison would
 
02:03:19.149 --> 02:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
be um part of the reason for our supp of
 
02:03:21.470 --> 02:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
the bill is twofold first as the
 
02:03:24.189 --> 02:03:24.199 align:start position:0%
committee has addressed that uh some
 
02:03:25.870 --> 02:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
communities may be in a position where
 
02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
they would prefer to have the S
 
02:03:29.589 --> 02:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee take over what is
 
02:03:32.310 --> 02:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
essentially a bulk energy facility uh
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
and the other piece of it is um while we
 
02:03:37.270 --> 02:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
haven't seen any utility scale storage
 
02:03:40.149 --> 02:03:40.159 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire yet we anticipate
 
02:03:43.030 --> 02:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
that it will and believe that the option
 
02:03:45.270 --> 02:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
for developers to use the site
 
02:03:48.990 --> 02:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation process is uh predictable uh
 
02:03:50.629 --> 02:03:50.639 align:start position:0%
um and something that would be built
 
02:03:52.589 --> 02:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
into the soft cost of developing a
 
02:03:54.990 --> 02:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
project like this um so we just start
 
02:03:57.310 --> 02:03:57.320 align:start position:0%
looking about um how we want to make
 
02:03:59.709 --> 02:03:59.719 align:start position:0%
sure that the capital flows to New
 
02:04:01.870 --> 02:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for these projects that
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
predictability and the control of the
 
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
soft costes uh is important it just
 
02:04:09.390 --> 02:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
seems logical to us as well when the
 
02:04:12.510 --> 02:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
side evaluation um statute
 
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
was and updated uh the concept of
 
02:04:17.629 --> 02:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
utility scale storage was really not
 
02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
something that was part of the indust
 
02:04:21.589 --> 02:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
it is now and we think it's uh
 
02:04:24.629 --> 02:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
reasonable to uh amend the S of
 
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
valuation statute but I can answer on
 
02:04:30.189 --> 02:04:30.199 align:start position:0%
I'll do my best to answer answer any of
 
02:04:32.109 --> 02:04:32.119 align:start position:0%
the questions youall might
 
02:04:34.950 --> 02:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
have thank you Mr Moran I see your
 
02:04:37.589 --> 02:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
representative man has his hand raised
 
02:04:39.310 --> 02:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
for a while uh representative man do you
 
02:04:42.149 --> 02:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
have a question uh well I was just GNA
 
02:04:44.790 --> 02:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
ask whether um whether we need to go
 
02:04:47.910 --> 02:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
much further it does seem like it's a so
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know it could Poss possibly be a
 
02:04:51.790 --> 02:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
dangerous object if it can
 
02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:53.830 align:start position:0%
dangerous object if it can
discharge

02:04:53.830 --> 02:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
discharge
 
02:04:56.669 --> 02:04:56.679 align:start position:0%
um what do I call it um you know a
 
02:04:59.870 --> 02:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
million or so watts in a short period of
 
02:05:02.310 --> 02:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
time somebody running a car into it or
 
02:05:05.310 --> 02:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
something like that by accident and so I
 
02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
and it's I don't think it's a huge huge
 
02:05:10.510 --> 02:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
battery it starts small when we can
 
02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
always change the
 
02:05:15.069 --> 02:05:15.079 align:start position:0%
specification if if this is this battery
 
02:05:17.390 --> 02:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
is smaller than we really really need to
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
worry about um so why don't we just go
 
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
ahead with it and Let It Go um the only
 
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
um you know the
 
02:05:28.750 --> 02:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
only reason not to uh pass the bill was
 
02:05:32.109 --> 02:05:32.119 align:start position:0%
it would be that U uh that it may be
 
02:05:34.069 --> 02:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
much smaller batteries would also be
 
02:05:35.669 --> 02:05:35.679 align:start position:0%
dangerous but I don't believe that's the
 
02:05:40.109 --> 02:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
case I'm thinking of uh 60 watts for 500
 
02:05:42.430 --> 02:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
hours is equivalent to that so it's a 60
 
02:05:45.830 --> 02:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
watt bulb for 500
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
hours you
 
02:05:47.679 --> 02:05:51.229 align:start position:0%
hours you
know

02:05:51.229 --> 02:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:54.830 --> 02:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh represent man I see a
 
02:05:57.990 --> 02:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
a rather shaded pale yellow hand for
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative McGee does that mean your
 
02:06:02.830 --> 02:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
question is uh uh not as strong as the
 
02:06:04.870 --> 02:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
others or how come yours is faded and
 
02:06:06.990 --> 02:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
the others haven't been whatever it is
 
02:06:08.510 --> 02:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
you're next you're next to have a
 
02:06:11.350 --> 02:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
question anyway yes thank you Mr Vice
 
02:06:13.390 --> 02:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
chair uh and thank you for the question
 
02:06:15.549 --> 02:06:15.559 align:start position:0%
about the color of my hand um you can
 
02:06:17.109 --> 02:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
actually pick different colors and my
 
02:06:19.069 --> 02:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
daughter made fun of me because my hand
 
02:06:21.430 --> 02:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
was was bright orange or some other
 
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
color and so I I picked a different
 
02:06:26.709 --> 02:06:26.719 align:start position:0%
color um so that's that uh I do have a
 
02:06:28.750 --> 02:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
question for Mr Monahan because I think
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
he might be able to answer it when we
 
02:06:33.310 --> 02:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
were going through reviews of the bill I
 
02:06:35.069 --> 02:06:35.079 align:start position:0%
know a question came up that I jotted
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
down in pencil because I often make
 
02:06:38.069 --> 02:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
notes on the bills because I can't
 
02:06:41.790 --> 02:06:41.800 align:start position:0%
remember everything and the question was
 
02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
how would uh this added storage
 
02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
component uh in the uh definitions of
 
02:06:51.149 --> 02:06:51.159 align:start position:0%
facilities how would it affect uh Power
 
02:06:53.149 --> 02:06:53.159 align:start position:0%
purchase agreements if at all is there
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
anything we should understand about how
 
02:06:57.790 --> 02:06:57.800 align:start position:0%
a power purchase agreement might be
 
02:07:00.750 --> 02:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
involved or affected by our um adding
 
02:07:03.549 --> 02:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
the storage facilities here yeah I don't
 
02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
think that that's uh would be applicable
 
02:07:08.189 --> 02:07:08.199 align:start position:0%
uh to any amendments to the side
 
02:07:10.589 --> 02:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
evaluation uh statute when you get into
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
the issue of uh PPA for power discharge
 
02:07:15.790 --> 02:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
and whether or not you're going toas
 
02:07:18.390 --> 02:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
that and if it's a wholesale or retail
 
02:07:20.270 --> 02:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
um activity that discharging that really
 
02:07:22.030 --> 02:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
falls into any sort of amendment to the
 
02:07:24.390 --> 02:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
restructuring act which I think is
 
02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
374f so I don't think I think this
 
02:07:29.910 --> 02:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
change here uh would be in would be
 
02:07:31.870 --> 02:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
indifferent to the types of questions
 
02:07:38.310 --> 02:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:42.350 --> 02:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you uh representative C
 
02:07:44.430 --> 02:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
pittz do you have an urgent question we
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
need to close this yeah what about
 
02:07:51.069 --> 02:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
forward capacity payments go
 
02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
ahead yeah again I think it's
 
02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
indifferent to that uh other provisions
 
02:07:57.870 --> 02:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
of state and federal War would detail
 
02:07:59.549 --> 02:07:59.559 align:start position:0%
whether or not the discharge of a large
 
02:08:01.229 --> 02:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
battery into the wholesale Market would
 
02:08:04.229 --> 02:08:04.239 align:start position:0%
qualify for for capacity payment uh it's
 
02:08:05.950 --> 02:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
a great question I'll try to find out
 
02:08:07.589 --> 02:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
the answer for that this is a good week
 
02:08:10.069 --> 02:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
to ask because the uh the auction is
 
02:08:12.589 --> 02:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
taking place over today the next couple
 
02:08:14.069 --> 02:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
of days but
 
02:08:16.750 --> 02:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
I thank you it's currently being
 
02:08:22.709 --> 02:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:25.549 --> 02:08:25.559 align:start position:0%
know okay thank you very much uh with
 
02:08:28.709 --> 02:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
that we'll close this uh public hearing
 
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
I will report that we had PE seven
 
02:08:34.709 --> 02:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
people sign in supporting the bill zero
 
02:08:37.470 --> 02:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
people signed in to oppose it two of
 
02:08:40.270 --> 02:08:40.280 align:start position:0%
those people were were um elected
 
02:08:42.390 --> 02:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
officials including Elaine
 
02:08:45.189 --> 02:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
Thomas representative Elaine Thomas and
 
02:08:50.270 --> 02:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
representative Latha maputi so with that
 
02:08:55.510 --> 02:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:58.149 --> 02:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
and yes representative oxam you're
 
02:09:00.109 --> 02:09:00.119 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question could we make
 
02:09:02.189 --> 02:09:02.199 align:start position:0%
sure that the issue was brought to the
 
02:09:03.990 --> 02:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
attention of the sponsor that he might
 
02:09:06.790 --> 02:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
want to amend this to make it megawatts
 
02:09:10.549 --> 02:09:10.559 align:start position:0%
and specify megawatt hours the typical
 
02:09:10.559 --> 02:09:13.069 align:start position:0%
and specify megawatt hours the typical
battery

02:09:13.069 --> 02:09:13.079 align:start position:0%
battery
 
02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
formulation absolutely we will have that
 
02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
discussion with representative
 
02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
Harrington with that we will recess uh
 
02:09:25.549 --> 02:09:25.559 align:start position:0%
until 1:00 enjoy your
 
02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.320 --> 02:10:17.229 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:17.239 --> 02:10:22.910 align:start position:0%
 
for

02:10:22.910 --> 02:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:22.920 --> 02:59:49.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

02:59:49.830 --> 02:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:53.670 --> 02:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
um our public hearings It's One o'clock
 
02:59:55.550 --> 02:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
And at one o'clock we have a public
 
02:59:58.429 --> 02:59:58.439 align:start position:0%
hearing scheduled on HB
 
03:00:01.389 --> 03:00:01.399 align:start position:0%
308 so I will call that public hearing
 
03:00:01.399 --> 03:00:02.510 align:start position:0%
308 so I will call that public hearing
to

03:00:02.510 --> 03:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:00:06.469 --> 03:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
order this uh bill is about is relative
 
03:00:10.190 --> 03:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
to broadband access to poll
 
03:00:13.190 --> 03:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
attachments and the prime sponsor of
 
03:00:16.429 --> 03:00:16.439 align:start position:0%
this bill is representative Marsh
 
03:00:18.269 --> 03:00:18.279 align:start position:0%
representative Bill Marsh
 
03:00:23.309 --> 03:00:23.319 align:start position:0%
from Brookfield representative Marsh is
 
03:00:26.750 --> 03:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh present and representative Marsh I

representative Marsh you have the
 
03:00:41.710 --> 03:00:41.720 align:start position:0%
floor thank you Mr chairman and and
 
03:00:43.150 --> 03:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
thank you science committee it's a
 
03:00:46.030 --> 03:00:46.040 align:start position:0%
pleasure coming before you today uh I
 
03:00:47.750 --> 03:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
will be very brief for the record I'm
 
03:00:49.550 --> 03:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
representative William Marsh Carol
 
03:00:51.710 --> 03:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
County 8 representing seven towns in
 
03:00:54.229 --> 03:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
southern Carol County I am pleased today
 
03:00:55.870 --> 03:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
to offer for your consideration House
 
03:00:58.309 --> 03:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
Bill 308 relative to broadband access to
 
03:01:00.630 --> 03:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
pole attachments which I found at the
 
03:01:03.349 --> 03:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
request of the selectman of the town of
 
03:01:05.790 --> 03:01:05.800 align:start position:0%
Brookfield the issue in Brookfield is
 
03:01:07.670 --> 03:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
most of the polls are old enough that
 
03:01:10.030 --> 03:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
they need to be replaced to allow poll
 
03:01:12.870 --> 03:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
attachments the ex the existing polls
 
03:01:15.790 --> 03:01:15.800 align:start position:0%
are not to enough per standards adopted
 
03:01:17.229 --> 03:01:17.239 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:01:19.750 --> 03:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
1990s the electric company has been
 
03:01:21.670 --> 03:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
pushing for the cable people to pay the
 
03:01:24.150 --> 03:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
full cost of replacing the poles before
 
03:01:26.510 --> 03:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
allowing cable to be attached the
 
03:01:28.750 --> 03:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
Brookfield Selectmen feel this is
 
03:01:30.950 --> 03:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
unreasonable apparently this is the case
 
03:01:33.950 --> 03:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
in other towns as well I contacted
 
03:01:36.309 --> 03:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
Christa Sho the consumer advocate of the
 
03:01:39.110 --> 03:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
Pu she said that the electric company
 
03:01:40.950 --> 03:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
receives money in their rates to pay for
 
03:01:44.070 --> 03:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
the periodic replacement of poles she
 
03:01:46.830 --> 03:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
gave me the language here the suggestion
 
03:01:49.030 --> 03:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
is to Value the existing polls at their
 
03:01:52.110 --> 03:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
depreciated cost so the cable people pay
 
03:01:54.429 --> 03:01:54.439 align:start position:0%
that amount and the pole owner pays the
 
03:01:56.349 --> 03:01:56.359 align:start position:0%
remainder which they should have already
 
03:01:59.190 --> 03:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
seen offset in electric rates over the
 
03:02:01.630 --> 03:02:01.640 align:start position:0%
years the Selectmen of Brookfield tell
 
03:02:03.469 --> 03:02:03.479 align:start position:0%
me that if the replacement cost for the
 
03:02:05.910 --> 03:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
polls in Brookfield is the depreciated
 
03:02:07.670 --> 03:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
value which is of course less than the
 
03:02:10.070 --> 03:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
full replacement cost then the cable
 
03:02:11.950 --> 03:02:11.960 align:start position:0%
company Spectrum says they will run
 
03:02:14.429 --> 03:02:14.439 align:start position:0%
Broadband in Brookfield as the density
 
03:02:16.670 --> 03:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
is sufficient for them to recover their
 
03:02:19.030 --> 03:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
costs I thank you and I'll be glad to
 
03:02:19.040 --> 03:02:21.269 align:start position:0%
costs I thank you and I'll be glad to
take

03:02:21.269 --> 03:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
take
 
03:02:23.950 --> 03:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Marsh
 
03:02:26.269 --> 03:02:26.279 align:start position:0%
uh representative Thomas is recognized
 
03:02:27.590 --> 03:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
for a
 
03:02:30.349 --> 03:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you uh
 
03:02:32.710 --> 03:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
03:02:37.870 --> 03:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
just to be clear does the when you when
 
03:02:40.670 --> 03:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
you refer to the replacement cost of the
 
03:02:44.469 --> 03:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
polls do you also mean the replacement
 
03:02:47.910 --> 03:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
cost of the polls plus the costs
 
03:02:51.110 --> 03:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
associated with transferring the um the
 
03:02:53.550 --> 03:02:53.560 align:start position:0%
other equipment from the old Pole to the
 
03:02:54.990 --> 03:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
new pole as
 
03:02:57.590 --> 03:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
well uh I believe that to be the case
 
03:02:59.269 --> 03:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
but Christina sh I believe is also
 
03:03:01.590 --> 03:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify and is far better
 
03:03:09.269 --> 03:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:12.110 --> 03:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank okay representative PL is
 
03:03:14.469 --> 03:03:14.479 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
03:03:17.670 --> 03:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh Mr chairman and thank
 
03:03:19.389 --> 03:03:19.399 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
03:03:23.269 --> 03:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh I'm going to use a
 
03:03:26.790 --> 03:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
an example numbers let's say a new poll
 
03:03:29.990 --> 03:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
costs a thousand bucks and uh it's
 
03:03:34.349 --> 03:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
written off over 30 years uh so uh in
 
03:03:37.070 --> 03:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
year 30 it's zero let's say year 29
 
03:03:40.349 --> 03:03:40.359 align:start position:0%
there uh small amount of money left are
 
03:03:44.429 --> 03:03:44.439 align:start position:0%
you saying that the the uh cable company
 
03:03:46.429 --> 03:03:46.439 align:start position:0%
will only pay a portion of that small
 
03:03:49.389 --> 03:03:49.399 align:start position:0%
amount of money left after 29 years and
 
03:03:51.550 --> 03:03:51.560 align:start position:0%
the utility has to put in the brand new
 
03:03:55.229 --> 03:03:55.239 align:start position:0%
poll at ,000 and therefore that thousand
 
03:03:56.910 --> 03:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
that thousand minus the small
 
03:04:00.630 --> 03:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
contribution winds up on rate payers
 
03:04:04.870 --> 03:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
rates uh as as an undepreciated
 
03:04:07.630 --> 03:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
poll uh representative it's a pleasure
 
03:04:08.870 --> 03:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
seeing you again and I'm glad that
 
03:04:12.630 --> 03:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
you're well and before us today my my
 
03:04:14.110 --> 03:04:14.120 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the electric
 
03:04:16.110 --> 03:04:16.120 align:start position:0%
company has already received in its
 
03:04:18.710 --> 03:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
electric rates over the years the
 
03:04:21.269 --> 03:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
majority of the cost of a poll that old
 
03:04:24.510 --> 03:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
and therefore for them to be paying uh
 
03:04:26.349 --> 03:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
the cost of a poll that would then
 
03:04:28.710 --> 03:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
presumably last for the foreseeable
 
03:04:30.910 --> 03:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
lifetime of that telephone poll and for
 
03:04:32.550 --> 03:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
which they would continue to receive a
 
03:04:34.469 --> 03:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
reimbursement in their electrical rates
 
03:04:38.590 --> 03:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:41.550 --> 03:04:41.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable thank you are there any
 
03:04:45.429 --> 03:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
 
03:04:47.870 --> 03:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
Marsh uh representative McGee you're
 
03:04:50.190 --> 03:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you Mr
 
03:04:51.910 --> 03:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
03:04:55.269 --> 03:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
Marsh my question is what necessitates a
 
03:04:57.670 --> 03:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
replacement condition so I guess what
 
03:04:59.510 --> 03:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get at is what is the
 
03:05:02.710 --> 03:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
scale of the operation if we do
 
03:05:04.309 --> 03:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
Implement a bill that says we're going
 
03:05:09.150 --> 03:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
to start uh allowing supporting or uh
 
03:05:12.030 --> 03:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
enforcing replacement of polls which
 
03:05:14.110 --> 03:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
which polls get replaced it's obviously
 
03:05:16.469 --> 03:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
not just
 
03:05:18.670 --> 03:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
Brookfield well clearly there's no
 
03:05:21.469 --> 03:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
reason to replace the polls uh for toer
 
03:05:23.190 --> 03:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
polls to allow pole attachments unless
 
03:05:25.269 --> 03:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
somebody is wanting to attach something
 
03:05:27.550 --> 03:05:27.560 align:start position:0%
to those poles so I believe this is
 
03:05:28.830 --> 03:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
something that the cable company
 
03:05:31.150 --> 03:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
electric company would work out amongst
 
03:05:33.469 --> 03:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
themselves as they knew now just the
 
03:05:35.150 --> 03:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
issue now is that there's a question how
 
03:05:40.349 --> 03:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:43.229 --> 03:05:43.239 align:start position:0%
you uh representative oxenham is Rec
 
03:05:45.910 --> 03:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
03:05:49.750 --> 03:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
question yes um has the select board
 
03:05:52.389 --> 03:05:52.399 align:start position:0%
determined that working with the cable
 
03:05:55.750 --> 03:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
companies is the ideal solution it seems
 
03:05:58.389 --> 03:05:58.399 align:start position:0%
that around the state uh fiber optic is
 
03:06:01.630 --> 03:06:01.640 align:start position:0%
being seen as a Superior Solution to
 
03:06:05.870 --> 03:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
providing universal access to um
 
03:06:08.510 --> 03:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
Broadband uh that is my understanding
 
03:06:09.990 --> 03:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
but it's also my understanding that a
 
03:06:11.429 --> 03:06:11.439 align:start position:0%
member of the board of Selectmen will be
 
03:06:13.510 --> 03:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
here to testify before you so you would
 
03:06:15.990 --> 03:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
be better to ask them that directly
 
03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:18.030 align:start position:0%
be better to ask them that directly
thank

03:06:18.030 --> 03:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:06:21.349 --> 03:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you uh the chair recognizes
 
03:06:26.389 --> 03:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:29.469 --> 03:06:29.479 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:06:34.429 --> 03:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
you representative Marsh um from what I
 
03:06:37.950 --> 03:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
under do I have this corrected there are
 
03:06:37.960 --> 03:06:39.389 align:start position:0%
under do I have this corrected there are
some

03:06:39.389 --> 03:06:39.399 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:06:42.870 --> 03:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
normally a Broadband would just attach
 
03:06:42.880 --> 03:06:44.429 align:start position:0%
normally a Broadband would just attach
poll

03:06:44.429 --> 03:06:44.439 align:start position:0%
poll
 
03:06:47.070 --> 03:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
their wires to an existing pole but
 
03:06:50.830 --> 03:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
there's some reason why
 
03:06:54.590 --> 03:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
they polls are somehow
 
03:06:57.030 --> 03:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
inadequate uh yes you are correct about
 
03:06:59.070 --> 03:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
that what happened was back in the 90s
 
03:07:00.910 --> 03:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
they raised the height requirements for
 
03:07:03.510 --> 03:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
polls to allow a sufficient margin for
 
03:07:05.990 --> 03:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
safety to allow for more attachments uh
 
03:07:08.950 --> 03:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
such as cable and and uh telephones and
 
03:07:10.750 --> 03:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
various other things that attach to to
 
03:07:12.910 --> 03:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
poles the existing poles in our town it
 
03:07:15.269 --> 03:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
is my understanding our grandfather they
 
03:07:17.229 --> 03:07:17.239 align:start position:0%
don't need to be replaced now unless
 
03:07:19.070 --> 03:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
somebody chooses to attach something to
 
03:07:20.950 --> 03:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
them which is what the town wants
 
03:07:23.229 --> 03:07:23.239 align:start position:0%
because they went Broadband for some
 
03:07:24.990 --> 03:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
rather important
 
03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:27.630 align:start position:0%
rather important
reasons

03:07:27.630 --> 03:07:27.640 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
03:07:27.640 --> 03:07:29.670 align:start position:0%
reasons
followup

03:07:29.670 --> 03:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
followup
 
03:07:33.070 --> 03:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
followup uh thank you Mr chairman just
 
03:07:37.830 --> 03:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
what is what is the LIF span of uh
 
03:07:41.309 --> 03:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
pole you know are you asking me that
 
03:07:44.110 --> 03:07:44.120 align:start position:0%
question my my understanding from
 
03:07:46.389 --> 03:07:46.399 align:start position:0%
Christa Sho is that the lifespan May
 
03:07:49.110 --> 03:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
approximate 40 years but she again has I
 
03:07:50.710 --> 03:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
believe signed up to testify and can
 
03:07:53.469 --> 03:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
better answer that question thank
 
03:07:57.590 --> 03:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh miss Sho is indeed uh
 
03:08:00.590 --> 03:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify and will testify
 
03:08:03.469 --> 03:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
shortly uh representative parshall
 
03:08:05.750 --> 03:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a question thank
 
03:08:09.229 --> 03:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh good morning or good
 
03:08:12.150 --> 03:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh representative Marsh full
 
03:08:12.160 --> 03:08:13.550 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh representative Marsh full
appreciation

03:08:13.550 --> 03:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
appreciation
 
03:08:16.229 --> 03:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
is taken already on some of these polls
 
03:08:18.590 --> 03:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
won't the cable provider have to take up
 
03:08:20.030 --> 03:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
the pretty much the full amount of
 
03:08:23.070 --> 03:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:26.590 --> 03:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
poll uh my understanding is once a poll
 
03:08:28.710 --> 03:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
is fully depreciated it no longer would
 
03:08:30.510 --> 03:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
carry value in the books of the electric
 
03:08:32.870 --> 03:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
company having been fully paid for and
 
03:08:34.429 --> 03:08:34.439 align:start position:0%
therefore a replacement poll would
 
03:08:35.710 --> 03:08:35.720 align:start position:0%
become the responsibility of the
 
03:08:39.790 --> 03:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
electric company of of of the electric
 
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
company thank
 
03:08:43.950 --> 03:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
03:08:47.309 --> 03:08:47.319 align:start position:0%

we can hi I'm rich zacker a selectman
 
03:09:40.830 --> 03:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
from the town of Brookfield Brookfield
 
03:09:43.790 --> 03:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
is a small town of 700 residents in
 
03:09:46.830 --> 03:09:46.840 align:start position:0%
southern Carol County the town has about
 
03:09:50.190 --> 03:09:50.200 align:start position:0%
300 homes a 100 of which do not have
 
03:09:53.190 --> 03:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
internet service we've been working very
 
03:09:56.229 --> 03:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
hard to bring service into this area and
 
03:09:58.269 --> 03:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
we finally received an estimate from our
 
03:10:00.790 --> 03:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
internet provider to service the homes
 
03:10:03.550 --> 03:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
which do not currently have the internet
 
03:10:05.790 --> 03:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
most of these homes are within a Four
 
03:10:08.349 --> 03:10:08.359 align:start position:0%
Mile stretch of roads that comes to
 
03:10:10.950 --> 03:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
about 25 homes per mile which is more
 
03:10:12.389 --> 03:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
than adequate for them to make some
 
03:10:12.399 --> 03:10:14.630 align:start position:0%
than adequate for them to make some
money

03:10:14.630 --> 03:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:10:16.030 --> 03:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
it would seem to
 
03:10:18.710 --> 03:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
me when we received the estimate to
 
03:10:21.670 --> 03:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
provide service to these homes it was
 
03:10:26.110 --> 03:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
$700,000 or about $7,000 per home we saw
 
03:10:28.030 --> 03:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
that the cares act funding was provided
 
03:10:30.590 --> 03:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
to suppliers who could deploy internet
 
03:10:35.070 --> 03:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
coverage at less than $3,000 per
 
03:10:37.550 --> 03:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
home we couldn't understand why it was
 
03:10:40.030 --> 03:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
so much more for the town of Brookfield
 
03:10:42.229 --> 03:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
the vendor told us the polls were not
 
03:10:44.510 --> 03:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
sufficient to handle additional service
 
03:10:47.229 --> 03:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
attachments and had to be replaced at an
 
03:10:50.269 --> 03:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
estimated cost of $5,000
 
03:10:53.070 --> 03:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
each many of the polls in this town are
 
03:10:56.150 --> 03:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
well over 50 years old and in my opinion
 
03:10:59.830 --> 03:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
are fully depreciated the Pu guidance
 
03:11:01.469 --> 03:11:01.479 align:start position:0%
received from the state legislature is
 
03:11:02.469 --> 03:11:02.479 align:start position:0%
that the
 
03:11:06.150 --> 03:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
requestor pays the full replacement cost
 
03:11:07.870 --> 03:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
therefore we feel it's unlikely that
 
03:11:10.110 --> 03:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
Brookfield and many other small rural
 
03:11:12.309 --> 03:11:12.319 align:start position:0%
communities will ever get high-speed
 
03:11:15.110 --> 03:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
internet fully deployed we discussed
 
03:11:16.910 --> 03:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
this dilemma with representative Dr
 
03:11:18.590 --> 03:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
Marsh and he offered to submit this
 
03:11:21.429 --> 03:11:21.439 align:start position:0%
legislation to address the issue with
 
03:11:23.070 --> 03:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
that as background I urge you to support
 
03:11:24.630 --> 03:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
the bill and change the way the
 
03:11:26.269 --> 03:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
requesters have to pay for making
 
03:11:29.269 --> 03:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
utility polls ready for highspeed
 
03:11:31.309 --> 03:11:31.319 align:start position:0%
internet and there was a question
 
03:11:34.309 --> 03:11:34.319 align:start position:0%
earlier about fivr and yes we reached
 
03:11:36.429 --> 03:11:36.439 align:start position:0%
out to Consolidated
 
03:11:38.550 --> 03:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
Communications and they gave us a quote
 
03:11:40.190 --> 03:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
of $1.2
 
03:11:49.229 --> 03:11:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:51.590 --> 03:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
completely okay does that conclude your
 
03:11:53.750 --> 03:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
testimony then yes it
 
03:11:56.190 --> 03:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
does okay thank you do we have any
 
03:11:59.990 --> 03:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:03.550 --> 03:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
zacher anybody in the room have any
 
03:12:08.150 --> 03:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative oh okay I
 
03:12:09.550 --> 03:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
guess we don't have any questions
 
03:12:11.670 --> 03:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative plet you have a
 
03:12:14.389 --> 03:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
question don't forget to
 
03:12:18.030 --> 03:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
unmute just earlier testimony I've had
 
03:12:20.469 --> 03:12:20.479 align:start position:0%
spent many years at Public Service New
 
03:12:23.510 --> 03:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh for uh transmission polls
 
03:12:26.349 --> 03:12:26.359 align:start position:0%
are over 40-year life distribution polls
 
03:12:30.070 --> 03:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
are more like 30 that's
 
03:12:33.190 --> 03:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
all okay thank you uh seeing no
 
03:12:36.910 --> 03:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
additional questions for Mr zacher we
 
03:12:39.070 --> 03:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
will move on to our next presenter who
 
03:12:42.750 --> 03:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
will be Christa Sho who works for the
 
03:12:46.830 --> 03:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
Office of the consumer Advocate and
 
03:12:49.630 --> 03:12:49.640 align:start position:0%
she's uh representing herself I guess
 
03:12:53.150 --> 03:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
not the consumer advocate's office um
 
03:12:55.950 --> 03:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
anyway miss Sho you
 
03:13:00.870 --> 03:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
are uh on to testify go ahead please
 
03:13:02.750 --> 03:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman V and committee
 
03:13:06.349 --> 03:13:06.359 align:start position:0%
members um we did submit the testimony
 
03:13:09.269 --> 03:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the office of the consumer
 
03:13:13.630 --> 03:13:13.640 align:start position:0%
Advocate um to support the bill
 
03:13:17.469 --> 03:13:17.479 align:start position:0%
fundamentally um because uh we see
 
03:13:22.190 --> 03:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
Broadband as a necessity um for economic
 
03:13:25.630 --> 03:13:25.640 align:start position:0%
health education safety and social needs
 
03:13:29.309 --> 03:13:29.319 align:start position:0%
um and as a representative of
 
03:13:32.150 --> 03:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
residential ratee pairs
 
03:13:35.389 --> 03:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
um we think it's also important to weigh
 
03:13:38.750 --> 03:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
in from that perspective in
 
03:13:43.309 --> 03:13:43.319 align:start position:0%
that there is a um
 
03:13:47.150 --> 03:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
socialization of utility pole
 
03:13:50.710 --> 03:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
Replacements um that happens throughout
 
03:13:54.349 --> 03:13:54.359 align:start position:0%
the industry um and there are a number
 
03:13:57.429 --> 03:13:57.439 align:start position:0%
of reasons that that Poles get uh
 
03:13:59.670 --> 03:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
replaced um and there are areas where
 
03:14:02.670 --> 03:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
poles don't get replaced and in those
 
03:14:05.469 --> 03:14:05.479 align:start position:0%
circumstances where the polls have been
 
03:14:08.269 --> 03:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
fully depreciated because they're um
 
03:14:09.790 --> 03:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
many years
 
03:14:13.510 --> 03:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
old um it is uh
 
03:14:16.269 --> 03:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh for those pole
 
03:14:22.269 --> 03:14:22.279 align:start position:0%
Replacements uh to be um paid for um by
 
03:14:26.110 --> 03:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
the utility and and therefore that um
 
03:14:28.910 --> 03:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
winds up also being paid for by the rate
 
03:14:28.920 --> 03:14:30.469 align:start position:0%
winds up also being paid for by the rate
pairs

03:14:30.469 --> 03:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
pairs
 
03:14:35.349 --> 03:14:35.359 align:start position:0%
um the way that the commission uh rules
 
03:14:38.229 --> 03:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
work is essentially that the attaching
 
03:14:41.110 --> 03:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
entity is required to pay all of the
 
03:14:43.070 --> 03:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
Make Ready costs
 
03:14:47.389 --> 03:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
The Proposal before you is to allocate
 
03:14:52.150 --> 03:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
the cost to the attaching entity for any
 
03:14:55.070 --> 03:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
of the remaining life of the pole the
 
03:14:55.080 --> 03:14:56.550 align:start position:0%
of the remaining life of the pole the
pole

03:14:56.550 --> 03:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
pole
 
03:14:59.710 --> 03:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
life um you know depreciation inside of
 
03:15:02.229 --> 03:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
a utility is a is not a it's a
 
03:15:05.030 --> 03:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
complicated issue so it's you know every
 
03:15:08.150 --> 03:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
poll in and of itself by itself has a
 
03:15:10.790 --> 03:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
different pole life but there is an
 
03:15:13.510 --> 03:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
average um pole life that is considered
 
03:15:15.990 --> 03:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
and it's and it's part of a depreciation
 
03:15:18.790 --> 03:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
study so if a depreciation study
 
03:15:21.870 --> 03:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
indicates that the pole life for utility
 
03:15:26.950 --> 03:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
is 40 years or 30 years um to uh one of
 
03:15:29.070 --> 03:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
your committing members points I think
 
03:15:34.590 --> 03:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
rep representative PL um then uh that
 
03:15:36.910 --> 03:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
effectively becomes the the life of that
 
03:15:40.189 --> 03:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
poll and uh can be used as a way to
 
03:15:42.550 --> 03:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
create a rule that is you know
 
03:15:45.469 --> 03:15:45.479 align:start position:0%
relatively um should be relatively
 
03:15:48.910 --> 03:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
simple to to to implement
 
03:15:53.030 --> 03:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
um so uh with that I would I I welcome
 
03:15:54.670 --> 03:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
your questions and I I think that we
 
03:15:59.870 --> 03:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
already have a three lined up so
 
03:16:03.910 --> 03:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
um if you don't mind I would just ask um
 
03:16:07.229 --> 03:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
I'll address one of them uh the question
 
03:16:10.150 --> 03:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
one of the questions was whether or
 
03:16:13.150 --> 03:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
not the cost of
 
03:16:17.110 --> 03:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
moving um everything uh from one pole to
 
03:16:20.910 --> 03:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
the other would also uh be
 
03:16:26.269 --> 03:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
included and I agree with representative
 
03:16:30.750 --> 03:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
Marsh that that would be appropriate if
 
03:16:37.070 --> 03:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
the pole had been replaced after its um
 
03:16:41.790 --> 03:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
generally accepted uh useful life then
 
03:16:46.910 --> 03:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
the utility would have um moved the
 
03:16:51.150 --> 03:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
lines from the old Pole to the new pole
 
03:16:53.150 --> 03:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
um so it seems that sharing a
 
03:16:55.550 --> 03:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
proportional amount of that cost uh
 
03:16:57.030 --> 03:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
would also be
 
03:16:57.040 --> 03:17:00.070 align:start position:0%
would also be
reasonable

03:17:00.070 --> 03:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:03.429 --> 03:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
um and I will leave it to questions uh
 
03:17:05.590 --> 03:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
because I I'm not sure that I actually
 
03:17:08.710 --> 03:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
have the other one written down thank
 
03:17:11.429 --> 03:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you very much chair
 
03:17:13.990 --> 03:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Thomas for a
 
03:17:16.950 --> 03:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:17:21.030 --> 03:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh for taking my question um my
 
03:17:23.870 --> 03:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is that uh not all of the
 
03:17:26.469 --> 03:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
utility pills are owned by the same
 
03:17:28.990 --> 03:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
entity for instance uh some could be
 
03:17:31.110 --> 03:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
owned by an electric company some could
 
03:17:34.309 --> 03:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
be owned by perhaps a telephone company
 
03:17:36.030 --> 03:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not sure if some could be
 
03:17:37.710 --> 03:17:37.720 align:start position:0%
owned by the cable company that I'm not
 
03:17:41.590 --> 03:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
really sure but my my question is this
 
03:17:41.600 --> 03:17:42.830 align:start position:0%
really sure but my my question is this
um

03:17:42.830 --> 03:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:45.670 --> 03:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
if we if we were to assume that you had
 
03:17:48.590 --> 03:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
the same customer was taking Broadband
 
03:17:50.630 --> 03:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
cable and they're paying their electric
 
03:17:54.309 --> 03:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
bill and perhaps even have a phone bill
 
03:17:57.469 --> 03:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
um that the costs that were now being
 
03:18:00.349 --> 03:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
you know shifted from one to the other
 
03:18:04.110 --> 03:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
really uh that customer is going to pay
 
03:18:06.229 --> 03:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
the increased rates in the smaller
 
03:18:08.910 --> 03:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
proportion spread out amongst those
 
03:18:10.030 --> 03:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
three companies because if they're
 
03:18:12.309 --> 03:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
paying for cable they'll pay for some of
 
03:18:13.349 --> 03:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
if they're paying for the electric bill
 
03:18:15.910 --> 03:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
they'll be paying for some of that and
 
03:18:18.189 --> 03:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
for people that may not be buying cable
 
03:18:20.590 --> 03:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
they they they won't share in that cost
 
03:18:23.030 --> 03:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
so either way the cost is not being
 
03:18:25.070 --> 03:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
decreased it's just being spread out you
 
03:18:27.790 --> 03:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
know spread around the various
 
03:18:29.910 --> 03:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
individual bills that customers May pay
 
03:18:31.790 --> 03:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
if they're buying all of those Services
 
03:18:35.030 --> 03:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
is that is is is that a correct
 
03:18:37.229 --> 03:18:37.239 align:start position:0%
understanding I think that if you look
 
03:18:43.309 --> 03:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
at it um Statewide that is correct um
 
03:18:46.590 --> 03:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
the the issue in the most rural parts of
 
03:18:52.269 --> 03:18:52.279 align:start position:0%
the state is that the when the costs are
 
03:18:57.750 --> 03:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
so prohibitively high to um gain access
 
03:19:00.070 --> 03:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
to the pole generally because the old
 
03:19:02.550 --> 03:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
polls are very short and therefore
 
03:19:07.590 --> 03:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
there's no um room available uh for the
 
03:19:10.950 --> 03:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
new fiber line or the new cable line to
 
03:19:13.710 --> 03:19:13.720 align:start position:0%
be attached because generally what would
 
03:19:15.150 --> 03:19:15.160 align:start position:0%
what would happen is there might be some
 
03:19:16.990 --> 03:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
shifting of the lines so that there
 
03:19:21.510 --> 03:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
could be um space made available um so I
 
03:19:24.229 --> 03:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
guess as a general um matter the answer
 
03:19:27.870 --> 03:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
to your question is is yes um as a as a
 
03:19:30.990 --> 03:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
practical matter without doing something
 
03:19:34.070 --> 03:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
like this um many of the folks in towns
 
03:19:38.469 --> 03:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
like that uh don't have access uh to
 
03:19:41.469 --> 03:19:41.479 align:start position:0%
broadband because there's no uh
 
03:19:45.870 --> 03:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
economical viable way for such a few
 
03:19:51.349 --> 03:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
number of residents to um pay the high
 
03:19:53.630 --> 03:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
cost of replacing the poles that would
 
03:19:57.030 --> 03:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
facilitate the height that is needed to
 
03:20:00.349 --> 03:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
put in the required uh
 
03:20:04.070 --> 03:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:06.870 --> 03:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
you uh the chair recognizes
 
03:20:10.950 --> 03:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:14.830 --> 03:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman uh
 
03:20:16.790 --> 03:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
Miss sh hopefully this is something you
 
03:20:21.990 --> 03:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
can answer um the the the fee that
 
03:20:24.790 --> 03:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
basically goes on our electric bill
 
03:20:27.030 --> 03:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
which essentially pays for the upkeep of
 
03:20:30.510 --> 03:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
the poles and that sort of thing does
 
03:20:35.229 --> 03:20:35.239 align:start position:0%
that get reduced after the uh poll is
 
03:20:35.239 --> 03:20:36.710 align:start position:0%
that get reduced after the uh poll is
totally

03:20:36.710 --> 03:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
totally
 
03:20:39.510 --> 03:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
amortized or do we still continue to pay
 
03:20:39.520 --> 03:20:40.910 align:start position:0%
amortized or do we still continue to pay
that

03:20:40.910 --> 03:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:20:40.920 --> 03:20:45.710 align:start position:0%
that
fee

03:20:45.710 --> 03:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:49.389 --> 03:20:49.399 align:start position:0%
it's a complicated question um that's
 
03:20:52.349 --> 03:20:52.359 align:start position:0%
sort of part of the a depreciation study
 
03:20:55.150 --> 03:20:55.160 align:start position:0%
is generally done as part of a rate
 
03:21:00.790 --> 03:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
case um and that uh depreciation study
 
03:21:04.309 --> 03:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
um is part of what
 
03:21:08.550 --> 03:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
identifies the revenue requirement um
 
03:21:11.269 --> 03:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
and the revenue requirement for the
 
03:21:16.070 --> 03:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
utility is what helps establish uh the
 
03:21:20.950 --> 03:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
rates um I don't really have a clearer
 
03:21:23.349 --> 03:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
answer than that um but I believe that
 
03:21:26.349 --> 03:21:26.359 align:start position:0%
there is a utility representative
 
03:21:28.309 --> 03:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
available um that may be able to give
 
03:21:31.110 --> 03:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
you a clearer or better answer okay I'll
 
03:21:35.550 --> 03:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:39.590 --> 03:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:43.309 --> 03:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
um seeing no further questions from uh
 
03:21:46.309 --> 03:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
committee members I'll call on our next
 
03:21:50.870 --> 03:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
presenter who is Mark Dean representing
 
03:21:54.070 --> 03:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Electric Co-op so Mr
 
03:21:57.510 --> 03:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
Dean you're on thank you and uh good
 
03:21:59.349 --> 03:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
afternoon I have submitted written
 
03:22:01.590 --> 03:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
testimony so I'll try to just make a few
 
03:22:04.590 --> 03:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
quick points here uh so the so the co-op
 
03:22:06.830 --> 03:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
sees this from two perspectives the
 
03:22:10.269 --> 03:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
co-op owns a lot of polls and the co-op
 
03:22:12.550 --> 03:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
has to attach to
 
03:22:15.269 --> 03:22:15.279 align:start position:0%
other polls that are owned by Third
 
03:22:17.870 --> 03:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
parties and the rule not only in New
 
03:22:20.990 --> 03:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but uh for all the the states
 
03:22:23.469 --> 03:22:23.479 align:start position:0%
that are regulated by the FCC for pole
 
03:22:25.870 --> 03:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
attachments is I think as it has been
 
03:22:28.830 --> 03:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
described which is if there's a reason
 
03:22:32.309 --> 03:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
say the the poll is old and it uh Pat
 
03:22:35.309 --> 03:22:35.319 align:start position:0%
fails the a stress test that is taken
 
03:22:37.309 --> 03:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
and the the utility the pole owner has
 
03:22:39.429 --> 03:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
to replace it then the pole owner
 
03:22:40.870 --> 03:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
replaces that and they'll have to
 
03:22:43.070 --> 03:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
replace it at a higher height make more
 
03:22:45.510 --> 03:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
room if there's no other reason to
 
03:22:49.229 --> 03:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
replace it uh except for a new attacher
 
03:22:51.510 --> 03:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
coming in said we'd like to add an
 
03:22:54.429 --> 03:22:54.439 align:start position:0%
attachment and that the only way to do
 
03:22:57.510 --> 03:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
that is to have a taller pole than the
 
03:22:59.870 --> 03:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
FCC Rule and the state of New Hampshire
 
03:23:03.630 --> 03:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
rule is then the attacher the cost
 
03:23:07.990 --> 03:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
causer pays for that pole replacement
 
03:23:10.510 --> 03:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
and uh so as I say the co-op sees it
 
03:23:12.070 --> 03:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
from both sides because sometimes it's
 
03:23:14.349 --> 03:23:14.359 align:start position:0%
going to be pay because it's a pole
 
03:23:16.189 --> 03:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
owner and sometimes it's going to be pay
 
03:23:18.710 --> 03:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
because it's a pole attacher we think
 
03:23:20.550 --> 03:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
the co the cost
 
03:23:25.229 --> 03:23:25.239 align:start position:0%
causation uh rule works and is fair I
 
03:23:27.550 --> 03:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
think a couple of quick points a lot of
 
03:23:31.269 --> 03:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
you um have been through the uh property
 
03:23:33.990 --> 03:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
tax for utility legislation that took a
 
03:23:35.950 --> 03:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
few years to get through and I think if
 
03:23:37.630 --> 03:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
those who heard the testimony might
 
03:23:39.630 --> 03:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
remember there really is no such thing
 
03:23:41.950 --> 03:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
as a fully depreciated poll with the the
 
03:23:44.389 --> 03:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
poll owners are paying property taxes on
 
03:23:47.429 --> 03:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
those polls if uh some of them are 60
 
03:23:50.429 --> 03:23:50.439 align:start position:0%
years old and still if they if they're
 
03:23:52.990 --> 03:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
structurally sound we keep them in place
 
03:23:54.710 --> 03:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
because the idea is to provide the
 
03:23:57.790 --> 03:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
service uh that is safe and reliable and
 
03:23:59.910 --> 03:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
cost effective and uh if you don't need
 
03:24:04.070 --> 03:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
to replace it you don't replace it um so
 
03:24:06.790 --> 03:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
just a a reminder in that sense so from
 
03:24:08.990 --> 03:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
the the co-ops perspective the cost
 
03:24:11.790 --> 03:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
causation approach which is what the FCC
 
03:24:15.510 --> 03:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
still has what the rules uh here have uh
 
03:24:19.150 --> 03:24:19.160 align:start position:0%
we think is a reasonable approach and we
 
03:24:23.510 --> 03:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
think a better approach is to look at uh
 
03:24:26.870 --> 03:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
Senate bills 88 uh part two of that
 
03:24:28.469 --> 03:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
which is that's another bill that
 
03:24:31.469 --> 03:24:31.479 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley is on that's the
 
03:24:33.990 --> 03:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
OneTouch Make Ready Bill and that's a
 
03:24:37.309 --> 03:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
bill that actually produces Savings in
 
03:24:39.950 --> 03:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
costs so that the actual process of
 
03:24:42.150 --> 03:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
doing poll attachments
 
03:24:45.150 --> 03:24:45.160 align:start position:0%
uh is more cost effective instead of
 
03:24:47.670 --> 03:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
just allocating costs differently among
 
03:24:51.269 --> 03:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
different parties uh so while we're the
 
03:24:53.550 --> 03:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
co-op itself is working hard to expand
 
03:24:55.870 --> 03:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
Broadband in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:24:58.510 --> 03:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh that's the type of effort that we
 
03:25:00.510 --> 03:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
would endorse as opposed to just
 
03:25:03.830 --> 03:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
shifting some of those costs to uh
 
03:25:05.349 --> 03:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's the electric company or
 
03:25:07.750 --> 03:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
whoever else owns the
 
03:25:11.030 --> 03:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
poll and that's what I have for uh oral
 
03:25:11.040 --> 03:25:13.309 align:start position:0%
poll and that's what I have for uh oral
testimony

03:25:13.309 --> 03:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:25:15.229 --> 03:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr Dean I have a question
 
03:25:15.239 --> 03:25:17.349 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr Dean I have a question
for

03:25:17.349 --> 03:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:25:21.189 --> 03:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned the fact that towns
 
03:25:21.199 --> 03:25:23.670 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned the fact that towns
tax

03:25:23.670 --> 03:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
tax
 
03:25:27.830 --> 03:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
polls if a poll gets replaced does the
 
03:25:32.550 --> 03:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:35.269 --> 03:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
up it's a little more complicated
 
03:25:37.429 --> 03:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
because of the changes in the the
 
03:25:39.550 --> 03:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
statute used to be every town basically
 
03:25:42.990 --> 03:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
tax a poll at whatever value they
 
03:25:46.910 --> 03:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
assigned to it now it's an average um
 
03:25:51.870 --> 03:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
but if you replace polls more frequently
 
03:25:55.510 --> 03:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
the average age of your poll is now
 
03:25:59.150 --> 03:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
younger it's less depreciated because
 
03:26:01.910 --> 03:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
they do depreciate so property the
 
03:26:04.070 --> 03:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
overall property tax value that the
 
03:26:07.030 --> 03:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
utility is paying would go up I think is
 
03:26:09.950 --> 03:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
the the long and the
 
03:26:13.710 --> 03:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
short so as a follow-up question if this
 
03:26:16.710 --> 03:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass would that be an
 
03:26:19.510 --> 03:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
incentive for towns to try to get polls
 
03:26:21.429 --> 03:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
replaced so they could collect more tax
 
03:26:24.110 --> 03:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:28.030 --> 03:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
them I can't say whether it it would or
 
03:26:31.269 --> 03:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't under the under the reformed or
 
03:26:34.630 --> 03:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
revised utility property tax you know
 
03:26:36.269 --> 03:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
there would be some difference I don't
 
03:26:37.950 --> 03:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
know that it would be the kind of thing
 
03:26:40.630 --> 03:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
that would be a motivating factor can't
 
03:26:40.640 --> 03:26:42.710 align:start position:0%
that would be a motivating factor can't
say

03:26:42.710 --> 03:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:26:45.670 --> 03:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative Cali
 
03:26:48.550 --> 03:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
pittz is recognized for a
 
03:26:52.429 --> 03:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
question don't forget to unmute yeah uh
 
03:26:57.950 --> 03:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
question is on the uh who pays for the
 
03:27:02.830 --> 03:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
pole attachment itself not for for a new
 
03:27:07.030 --> 03:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
poll but for moving wires perhaps and
 
03:27:10.030 --> 03:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
rearranging things if an attachment has
 
03:27:12.349 --> 03:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
to be made
 
03:27:16.830 --> 03:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
again the general rule is that if let's
 
03:27:18.349 --> 03:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
say in this case you didn't even need to
 
03:27:20.710 --> 03:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
replace the pole but the attachments had
 
03:27:23.309 --> 03:27:23.319 align:start position:0%
to be rearranged to create the proper
 
03:27:25.910 --> 03:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
spacing then it would be the
 
03:27:28.309 --> 03:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
entity if there was no other reason to
 
03:27:30.750 --> 03:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
do that than it was whoever the last
 
03:27:32.670 --> 03:27:32.680 align:start position:0%
entity was that came and said we'd like
 
03:27:35.830 --> 03:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
to add an additional attachment again if
 
03:27:37.389 --> 03:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
that's the sole reason you're T
 
03:27:39.550 --> 03:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
undertaking the activity then that
 
03:27:42.349 --> 03:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
entity pays those costs
 
03:27:48.030 --> 03:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
may I follow up follow up we had uh a
 
03:27:52.189 --> 03:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
discussion about multiple polls in one
 
03:27:55.910 --> 03:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
area so if a company
 
03:27:59.309 --> 03:27:59.319 align:start position:0%
decides I don't need to add you know
 
03:28:02.630 --> 03:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
take down my old poll could they add a
 
03:28:06.429 --> 03:28:06.439 align:start position:0%
second poll and could that create a
 
03:28:09.510 --> 03:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
problem it's very hard for me to
 
03:28:12.750 --> 03:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
Envision the situation you're
 
03:28:15.630 --> 03:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
describing I guess if you're
 
03:28:18.710 --> 03:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
saying adding I mean usually what we try
 
03:28:21.030 --> 03:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
to avoid at all cost in this state right
 
03:28:23.790 --> 03:28:23.800 align:start position:0%
is Two Poles six inches from each other
 
03:28:26.229 --> 03:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
and creating a a wall of Po so as a
 
03:28:28.910 --> 03:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
general principle what you want to do is
 
03:28:31.670 --> 03:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
you're only going to have you minimize
 
03:28:33.510 --> 03:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
the number of polls you require so it's
 
03:28:35.030 --> 03:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
hard for me to
 
03:28:35.040 --> 03:28:37.110 align:start position:0%
hard for me to
picture

03:28:37.110 --> 03:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
picture
 
03:28:39.550 --> 03:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
um that that would be allowed to
 
03:28:41.830 --> 03:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
essentially just insert a number of
 
03:28:44.189 --> 03:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
poles in between the existing poles and
 
03:28:47.630 --> 03:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
that would probably be no more cost
 
03:28:51.910 --> 03:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:55.910 --> 03:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
system if I've understood correctly well
 
03:28:58.510 --> 03:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
apparently in this this particular air
 
03:29:01.510 --> 03:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
in this particular double pole we have
 
03:29:03.670 --> 03:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
had a problem with double poles in
 
03:29:06.189 --> 03:29:06.199 align:start position:0%
certain areas so that's just one of the
 
03:29:08.790 --> 03:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
things I was thinking about thank
 
03:29:12.189 --> 03:29:12.199 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative pintel is
 
03:29:15.070 --> 03:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
03:29:17.710 --> 03:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman
 
03:29:19.870 --> 03:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
essentially the same question I asked
 
03:29:22.269 --> 03:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
Miss sh
 
03:29:27.150 --> 03:29:27.160 align:start position:0%
um do the electric companies base the
 
03:29:31.630 --> 03:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
the the fee or that they charge their
 
03:29:35.469 --> 03:29:35.479 align:start position:0%
customers based on the
 
03:29:40.030 --> 03:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
um the the amortized lifespan of the
 
03:29:41.710 --> 03:29:41.720 align:start position:0%
polls or the actual
 
03:29:45.110 --> 03:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
ual costs that the electric companies
 
03:29:48.389 --> 03:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
are are having to replace poles some of
 
03:29:52.309 --> 03:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
them being 50 years old as an
 
03:29:56.189 --> 03:29:56.199 align:start position:0%
example so um I'll be a good witness in
 
03:29:58.990 --> 03:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
one way and in a bad and in another way
 
03:30:01.189 --> 03:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
here and the so the co-op isn't rate
 
03:30:03.990 --> 03:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
regulated by the puc so there will be
 
03:30:06.790 --> 03:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
some subtle differences but I I
 
03:30:09.070 --> 03:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully this answers the question
 
03:30:11.710 --> 03:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
correctly um
 
03:30:13.830 --> 03:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
so for example the the co-op when it's
 
03:30:15.910 --> 03:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
setting its rates it has to look at what
 
03:30:19.510 --> 03:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
its ongoing costs are and that includes
 
03:30:22.269 --> 03:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
depreciation and maintenance and the
 
03:30:26.070 --> 03:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
taxes all all of those things anything
 
03:30:28.269 --> 03:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
that increases that number is going to
 
03:30:30.269 --> 03:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
have an upward pressure all other things
 
03:30:34.110 --> 03:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
being equal on rates so if you think
 
03:30:39.070 --> 03:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
about um if if we were putting in if we
 
03:30:41.790 --> 03:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
were turning over polls placing polls
 
03:30:46.870 --> 03:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
every 5 years instead of every 35 years
 
03:30:49.229 --> 03:30:49.239 align:start position:0%
uh you know in that extreme example you
 
03:30:51.269 --> 03:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
would really see a very big cost
 
03:30:53.349 --> 03:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
difference because you're constantly
 
03:30:55.870 --> 03:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
putting in new polls it's not the most
 
03:30:57.790 --> 03:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
economically efficient way to do it it's
 
03:30:59.670 --> 03:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
like holding on to a car that you've
 
03:31:02.790 --> 03:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
paid the you know made the payments on
 
03:31:05.429 --> 03:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
uh or getting a new car every two years
 
03:31:07.070 --> 03:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
I think you know which one's more
 
03:31:11.950 --> 03:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
expensive so uh I think accelera pole
 
03:31:14.630 --> 03:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
Replacements would have an upward
 
03:31:17.269 --> 03:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
pressure on rates generally speaking and
 
03:31:20.510 --> 03:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
for a regulated utility I assume that
 
03:31:22.750 --> 03:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
would mean because of the depreciation
 
03:31:25.110 --> 03:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
they would have a greater a higher rate
 
03:31:27.030 --> 03:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
base that's what their revenue
 
03:31:30.750 --> 03:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:35.070 --> 03:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
upon uh followup question
 
03:31:38.510 --> 03:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
followup just because I'm I'm having a
 
03:31:41.510 --> 03:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
difficulty grasping this so
 
03:31:44.750 --> 03:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh even if a poll has already reached
 
03:31:48.830 --> 03:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
its uh its
 
03:31:54.710 --> 03:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh estimated lifespan say it's 30 years
 
03:31:57.510 --> 03:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
um if if it
 
03:32:02.349 --> 03:32:02.359 align:start position:0%
is replaced at that time as opposed to
 
03:32:06.429 --> 03:32:06.439 align:start position:0%
replaced 10 years later it will make a
 
03:32:06.439 --> 03:32:07.830 align:start position:0%
replaced 10 years later it will make a
difference

03:32:07.830 --> 03:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
difference
 
03:32:10.150 --> 03:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
in what you're going to charge your
 
03:32:10.160 --> 03:32:13.110 align:start position:0%
in what you're going to charge your
customers

03:32:13.110 --> 03:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:15.349 --> 03:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'm not talking about pole
 
03:32:17.710 --> 03:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
let's say you had to replace all your
 
03:32:20.469 --> 03:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
poles at 30 years even though they're
 
03:32:23.950 --> 03:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
totally amortized or 40 years that would
 
03:32:25.269 --> 03:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
make a
 
03:32:28.750 --> 03:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
difference it would it would if you
 
03:32:29.950 --> 03:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
you're if
 
03:32:32.309 --> 03:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
you're I call it turning over if you're
 
03:32:36.389 --> 03:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
turning over the stock of your polls
 
03:32:39.110 --> 03:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
then you're going to start the if you're
 
03:32:41.910 --> 03:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
in a rate making situation you're going
 
03:32:44.510 --> 03:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
to have higher rate base because you're
 
03:32:46.189 --> 03:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
going to there won't be fully
 
03:32:48.309 --> 03:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
depreciated and again they're never
 
03:32:49.830 --> 03:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
actually fully
 
03:32:53.349 --> 03:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
depreciated uh and uh so that is going
 
03:32:56.870 --> 03:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
to be there'll be an increase in overall
 
03:33:00.070 --> 03:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
costs and that will cause an increase in
 
03:33:03.950 --> 03:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:07.830 --> 03:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you any further questions for
 
03:33:11.309 --> 03:33:11.319 align:start position:0%
Mr Dean seeing none I'll thank Mr Dean
 
03:33:13.070 --> 03:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
for his testimony and move on to our
 
03:33:17.790 --> 03:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
next presenter thank you who is Chris
 
03:33:22.189 --> 03:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
hodgon representing Comcast Mr hodon the
 
03:33:23.349 --> 03:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
floor is
 
03:33:26.389 --> 03:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
yours good afternoon may I
 
03:33:30.229 --> 03:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
continue you may thank you good
 
03:33:32.429 --> 03:33:32.439 align:start position:0%
afternoon chairman Vose members of the
 
03:33:34.870 --> 03:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Chris hodon I'm
 
03:33:36.349 --> 03:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
Comcast vice president of the government
 
03:33:38.550 --> 03:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
Affairs here in New Hampshire and we
 
03:33:43.229 --> 03:33:43.239 align:start position:0%
serve approximately 350 ,000 Broadband
 
03:33:46.389 --> 03:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
customers uh throughout the 107
 
03:33:48.469 --> 03:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
communities uh that we serve here in the
 
03:33:52.150 --> 03:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
state and while we have concerns with
 
03:33:55.469 --> 03:33:55.479 align:start position:0%
the way the legislation is written I
 
03:33:58.189 --> 03:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
want to both recognize and applaud the
 
03:34:00.950 --> 03:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
sponsors uh interest and just recognize
 
03:34:04.150 --> 03:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
that that we do support uh policies
 
03:34:06.469 --> 03:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
which reduce the barriers to broadband
 
03:34:09.469 --> 03:34:09.479 align:start position:0%
deployment and we further agree that
 
03:34:12.950 --> 03:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
this issue of pole replacement in rural
 
03:34:16.189 --> 03:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
areas is a a worthy issue and one that
 
03:34:19.870 --> 03:34:19.880 align:start position:0%
uh needs to be addressed um we we've
 
03:34:22.910 --> 03:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
long advocated for both here at the
 
03:34:25.670 --> 03:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
legislature and at the Pu policies that
 
03:34:27.870 --> 03:34:27.880 align:start position:0%
do reduce the cost and and other
 
03:34:31.110 --> 03:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
barriers to deployment and most recently
 
03:34:33.590 --> 03:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
our trade Association at the FCC
 
03:34:38.189 --> 03:34:38.199 align:start position:0%
advocated for um policies that uh very
 
03:34:40.070 --> 03:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
are very similar to the intent of this
 
03:34:41.870 --> 03:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
legislation which is that in areas where
 
03:34:42.950 --> 03:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
there are not
 
03:34:45.510 --> 03:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
Broadband it's unjust and unreasonable
 
03:34:48.510 --> 03:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
for pole owners to shift all pole
 
03:34:50.950 --> 03:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
replacement cost onto new
 
03:34:54.870 --> 03:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
attachers uh which would be as other
 
03:34:57.349 --> 03:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
parties have said the cable companies
 
03:34:58.750 --> 03:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
companies like
 
03:35:01.269 --> 03:35:01.279 align:start position:0%
Comcast utility polls truly are
 
03:35:03.269 --> 03:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
indispensable to the deployment of
 
03:35:05.630 --> 03:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
broadband their choke points through
 
03:35:08.590 --> 03:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
which all communication infrastructure
 
03:35:10.110 --> 03:35:10.120 align:start position:0%
and all communication Services must
 
03:35:11.830 --> 03:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
travel one point or
 
03:35:14.870 --> 03:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
another and uh as has previously been
 
03:35:17.510 --> 03:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
noted these assets are owned either
 
03:35:20.349 --> 03:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
jointly or solely by Electric utilities
 
03:35:21.710 --> 03:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
and telephone
 
03:35:24.269 --> 03:35:24.279 align:start position:0%
utilities who are uh either rate
 
03:35:26.670 --> 03:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
regulated or in many cases are
 
03:35:28.790 --> 03:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
competitors to the companies who wish to
 
03:35:32.630 --> 03:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
access the polls so as a result of that
 
03:35:36.830 --> 03:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
the uh these assets are are heavily
 
03:35:39.550 --> 03:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
regulated uh both at the FCC and in
 
03:35:41.070 --> 03:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
States like New Hampshire who have
 
03:35:44.990 --> 03:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
certified that they will regulate them
 
03:35:49.070 --> 03:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
at the state level and that regulated
 
03:35:52.229 --> 03:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
um interest extends to both the rates
 
03:35:54.269 --> 03:35:54.279 align:start position:0%
that are paid the terms and the
 
03:35:56.670 --> 03:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
conditions of access to those
 
03:35:59.349 --> 03:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
polls and because of their regulated
 
03:36:03.389 --> 03:36:03.399 align:start position:0%
nature policy changes really implicate a
 
03:36:06.229 --> 03:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
a complex range of issues from safety
 
03:36:09.349 --> 03:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
and reliability to the rates customers
 
03:36:12.750 --> 03:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
pay and uh detachers pay through rent
 
03:36:14.870 --> 03:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
use of the RightWay and and also the
 
03:36:17.550 --> 03:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
efficiency and economics of broadband
 
03:36:20.990 --> 03:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
deployment so it's it really is truly a
 
03:36:24.030 --> 03:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
complex issue with a lot of interwoven
 
03:36:28.750 --> 03:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
interests and uh impacts on how we all
 
03:36:31.269 --> 03:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
um run our networks and deploy our
 
03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
services in the state and our concerns
 
03:36:36.750 --> 03:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
with the bill although the bill is brief
 
03:36:38.910 --> 03:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
I really come down to to two things one
 
03:36:41.510 --> 03:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
is that we we're worried that the bill
 
03:36:44.670 --> 03:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
is overly Broad and vague in some of the
 
03:36:46.309 --> 03:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
terminology that it
 
03:36:50.030 --> 03:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
uses uh the use of terms like areas uh
 
03:36:53.189 --> 03:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
Make Ready which is not otherwise used
 
03:36:56.150 --> 03:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
in the Hampshire statute the use of a
 
03:37:01.269 --> 03:37:01.279 align:start position:0%
100 by 100 megabit standard uh all um
 
03:37:04.150 --> 03:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
create we we believe some ambiguity and
 
03:37:07.429 --> 03:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
vagueness in the Statue which we fear
 
03:37:10.750 --> 03:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
will lead to unintended consequences uh
 
03:37:10.760 --> 03:37:12.150 align:start position:0%
will lead to unintended consequences uh
in

03:37:12.150 --> 03:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:37:15.830 --> 03:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
particular uh as has been described by a
 
03:37:18.630 --> 03:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
couple of the folks who testified there
 
03:37:21.469 --> 03:37:21.479 align:start position:0%
are two types of pole Replacements that
 
03:37:23.590 --> 03:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
typically occur when a Broadband
 
03:37:27.349 --> 03:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
provider needs to access polls the first
 
03:37:31.269 --> 03:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
being a situation when the poll is not
 
03:37:33.790 --> 03:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
adequate to accommodate the additional
 
03:37:35.750 --> 03:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
attachment it needs to be taller as Mr
 
03:37:38.110 --> 03:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
Dean said and in that instance the cost
 
03:37:40.070 --> 03:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
is borne by the company who wants to
 
03:37:42.790 --> 03:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
access the polls currently in New
 
03:37:45.110 --> 03:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the second type of pole
 
03:37:47.630 --> 03:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
replacement which occurs when the pole
 
03:37:50.510 --> 03:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
is out of compliance either for safety
 
03:37:53.030 --> 03:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
purposes reliability or damage to the
 
03:37:55.750 --> 03:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
pole that cost is borne by the pole
 
03:37:58.030 --> 03:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
owner and not by the company wishing to
 
03:38:01.750 --> 03:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
access the polls and our concern is that
 
03:38:03.790 --> 03:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
in the language of the bill is
 
03:38:06.750 --> 03:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
written because the term Make Ready is
 
03:38:09.309 --> 03:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
used to Encompass all pole
 
03:38:12.110 --> 03:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
replacements that last type of pole
 
03:38:15.030 --> 03:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
replacement which is currently not uh
 
03:38:16.830 --> 03:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
whose costs are not currently born by a
 
03:38:20.269 --> 03:38:20.279 align:start position:0%
new attacher will now through a pra
 
03:38:23.229 --> 03:38:23.239 align:start position:0%
formula uh be borne in part by a
 
03:38:23.239 --> 03:38:24.429 align:start position:0%
formula uh be borne in part by a
Broadband

03:38:24.429 --> 03:38:24.439 align:start position:0%
Broadband
 
03:38:26.670 --> 03:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
provider uh we think that that'll have
 
03:38:30.030 --> 03:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequence of increasing
 
03:38:32.469 --> 03:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
the cost of this type of pole
 
03:38:34.950 --> 03:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
replacement for a Broadband provider
 
03:38:37.710 --> 03:38:37.720 align:start position:0%
currently doesn't pay for that cost now
 
03:38:40.950 --> 03:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
it might actually uh create additional
 
03:38:42.630 --> 03:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
disincentives for Royal Broadband
 
03:38:45.349 --> 03:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
deployment and not achieve the goals of
 
03:38:47.990 --> 03:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
the bill sponsor which is to make it
 
03:38:50.710 --> 03:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
less expensive and accelerate that
 
03:38:53.590 --> 03:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
deployment so so our hope is that if the
 
03:38:56.510 --> 03:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
committee chooses to have a subcommittee
 
03:38:59.830 --> 03:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
or engage in a process to bring the
 
03:39:01.630 --> 03:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
stakeholders together that we have an
 
03:39:04.950 --> 03:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to participate in that um
 
03:39:07.110 --> 03:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
that the committee may
 
03:39:09.239 --> 03:39:11.189 align:start position:0%
that the committee may
have

03:39:11.189 --> 03:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:39:13.830 --> 03:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Thomas is
 
03:39:15.389 --> 03:39:15.399 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
03:39:17.950 --> 03:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
03:39:20.630 --> 03:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Mr hushon um
 
03:39:22.150 --> 03:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
first I want to clarify something I just
 
03:39:24.309 --> 03:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
heard you say uh did I hear you say
 
03:39:29.550 --> 03:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
correctly that the current costs of um
 
03:39:32.389 --> 03:39:32.399 align:start position:0%
moving other equipment and wires from
 
03:39:35.150 --> 03:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
the old Pole to the new pole was
 
03:39:38.750 --> 03:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
currently not being born by the uh cable
 
03:39:40.189 --> 03:39:40.199 align:start position:0%
providers when they want to put in new
 
03:39:43.710 --> 03:39:43.720 align:start position:0%
BR B was that what you were saying uh no
 
03:39:45.309 --> 03:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative what I was saying is
 
03:39:49.189 --> 03:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
that in an instance where the poll is in
 
03:39:51.550 --> 03:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
need of replacement for safety purposes
 
03:39:54.510 --> 03:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
it's out of compliance with uh
 
03:39:57.510 --> 03:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
applicable standards the pole
 
03:40:00.870 --> 03:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
replacement is borne by the pole owner
 
03:40:00.880 --> 03:40:02.309 align:start position:0%
replacement is borne by the pole owner
um

03:40:02.309 --> 03:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:05.790 --> 03:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
when a pole attacher needs to move its
 
03:40:08.630 --> 03:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
equipment to accommodate another
 
03:40:10.870 --> 03:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
provider uh whether
 
03:40:15.070 --> 03:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
when um the pole is needs to be
 
03:40:18.269 --> 03:40:18.279 align:start position:0%
replaced um because it's lacking in
 
03:40:21.070 --> 03:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
sufficient height uh those costs aren't
 
03:40:23.990 --> 03:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
treated the the same
 
03:40:29.189 --> 03:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
way follow follow up thank you m um so
 
03:40:31.710 --> 03:40:31.720 align:start position:0%
my question then is is it your
 
03:40:31.720 --> 03:40:33.630 align:start position:0%
my question then is is it your
experience

03:40:33.630 --> 03:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
experience
 
03:40:36.710 --> 03:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
that is is it the
 
03:40:40.750 --> 03:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
cost of the pole replacement issue
 
03:40:43.670 --> 03:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
that is the primary and sometimes the
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
sole reason why Broadband is not being
 
03:40:49.550 --> 03:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
put into the rural area or are there
 
03:40:52.950 --> 03:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
other reasons why you you do not put
 
03:40:55.229 --> 03:40:55.239 align:start position:0%
broader band into any rural areas
 
03:40:57.790 --> 03:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
besides the cost of pole
 
03:41:00.469 --> 03:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
replacement uh thank you representative
 
03:41:02.550 --> 03:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
so the uh
 
03:41:05.429 --> 03:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
economic considerations when deploying
 
03:41:08.630 --> 03:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
Broadband are complex there's no single
 
03:41:10.830 --> 03:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
reason uh that
 
03:41:13.630 --> 03:41:13.640 align:start position:0%
uh a project may or may not be
 
03:41:16.670 --> 03:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
feasible it is certainly true and as the
 
03:41:19.990 --> 03:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor noted um and what this
 
03:41:21.990 --> 03:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
legislation seeks to address is that
 
03:41:25.870 --> 03:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
pole replacement costs are a part of
 
03:41:31.189 --> 03:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:33.389 --> 03:41:33.399 align:start position:0%
substantial okay thank you the chair now
 
03:41:37.229 --> 03:41:37.239 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Lang for a
 
03:41:39.070 --> 03:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair it's
 
03:41:42.110 --> 03:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:49.630 --> 03:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:52.030 --> 03:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
all sorry I think I
 
03:41:54.830 --> 03:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
lost Mr chair are we gonna have anybody
 
03:41:58.349 --> 03:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:02.269 --> 03:42:02.279 align:start position:0%
all nobody from the puc is here I don't
 
03:42:04.349 --> 03:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
believe I'll ask this gentlemen my
 
03:42:07.550 --> 03:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
question so my question is who defines
 
03:42:10.870 --> 03:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
the rules about the wire placement on a
 
03:42:10.880 --> 03:42:14.670 align:start position:0%
the rules about the wire placement on a
given

03:42:14.670 --> 03:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:18.630 --> 03:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
poll is that for Mr hon yeah thank you
 
03:42:23.670 --> 03:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so um how attachers uh either
 
03:42:26.349 --> 03:42:26.359 align:start position:0%
attach to or maintain their attachment
 
03:42:28.670 --> 03:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
to the poll is is found in the 1300
 
03:42:33.110 --> 03:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
rules of the puc uh those rules um rely
 
03:42:36.510 --> 03:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
heavily on the National Electric Code uh
 
03:42:40.229 --> 03:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
for issues of safety and uh as an
 
03:42:42.309 --> 03:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
industry we look to those standards when
 
03:42:44.830 --> 03:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
we um either are attaching or
 
03:42:47.389 --> 03:42:47.399 align:start position:0%
maintaining our attachments to the polls
 
03:42:49.870 --> 03:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
as a a matter of
 
03:42:52.990 --> 03:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
tradition uh the lowest attacher on the
 
03:42:56.389 --> 03:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
poll is the telephone utility uh and
 
03:43:00.389 --> 03:43:00.399 align:start position:0%
then as you move up the poll you find uh

followup

followup
 
03:43:29.110 --> 03:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
please so my my followup question is do
 
03:43:31.550 --> 03:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
you know if there's any talk at pu about
 
03:43:34.550 --> 03:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
creating some sort of waiver process to
 
03:43:37.590 --> 03:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
as long as they can show that whatever
 
03:43:39.870 --> 03:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
kind of attachment is still safe that
 
03:43:41.950 --> 03:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
that they would allow uh Broadband
 
03:43:43.590 --> 03:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
connections again you know we've learned
 
03:43:46.229 --> 03:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
a lot from the current state of affairs
 
03:43:48.030 --> 03:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
right now and and the dramatic need for
 
03:43:50.349 --> 03:43:50.359 align:start position:0%
Broadband so I'm wondering if pu is
 
03:43:52.510 --> 03:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
creating any kind of waiver requirements
 
03:43:54.510 --> 03:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
for that if someone could put together a
 
03:43:57.389 --> 03:43:57.399 align:start position:0%
poll plan that would work especially if
 
03:43:58.990 --> 03:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
the polls say G to be replaced over the
 
03:44:01.269 --> 03:44:01.279 align:start position:0%
next 15 years and then they can meet
 
03:44:04.429 --> 03:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
compliance but those Gap areas where the
 
03:44:06.870 --> 03:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
poll's not quite old enough to replace
 
03:44:08.710 --> 03:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
you know for any good reason is there
 
03:44:10.189 --> 03:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
any kind of conversation happening
 
03:44:12.670 --> 03:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
around that at the
 
03:44:16.309 --> 03:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
Pu I don't think I'm the right um person
 
03:44:18.149 --> 03:44:18.159 align:start position:0%
to answer what what sort of conversation
 
03:44:21.510 --> 03:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
is going on puc we're not actively
 
03:44:25.389 --> 03:44:25.399 align:start position:0%
participating one I I would say that the
 
03:44:27.630 --> 03:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
U the current 1300
 
03:44:29.349 --> 03:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
rules uh
 
03:44:29.359 --> 03:44:30.910 align:start position:0%
rules uh
do

03:44:30.910 --> 03:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:44:33.910 --> 03:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
contemplate uh what s what in what
 
03:44:37.590 --> 03:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances a poll owner can deny
 
03:44:39.990 --> 03:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
access to a poll one of them is say
 
03:44:42.910 --> 03:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
safety and and it all those rules
 
03:44:46.269 --> 03:44:46.279 align:start position:0%
further um articulate when a poll owner
 
03:44:50.030 --> 03:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
cannot deny access to an a Broadband
 
03:44:51.429 --> 03:44:51.439 align:start position:0%
company or another entity that wants to
 
03:44:54.710 --> 03:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
attach the polls
 
03:44:59.030 --> 03:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
so you you may referral to those 1300
 
03:45:01.229 --> 03:45:01.239 align:start position:0%
rules may be appropriate to to answer
 
03:45:06.149 --> 03:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:09.990 --> 03:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
asked okay thank you the chair next
 
03:45:12.429 --> 03:45:12.439 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Cali pittz for
 
03:45:14.790 --> 03:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
a question I I
 
03:45:18.510 --> 03:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
I I think representative oxenham was far
 
03:45:18.520 --> 03:45:19.510 align:start position:0%
I I think representative oxenham was far
before

03:45:19.510 --> 03:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:45:23.670 --> 03:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
me but I'll ask my question Chris uh
 
03:45:26.269 --> 03:45:26.279 align:start position:0%
when uh a Broadband
 
03:45:28.830 --> 03:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
company puts up or
 
03:45:31.790 --> 03:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
replaces and puts up fiber perhaps do
 
03:45:34.269 --> 03:45:34.279 align:start position:0%
they take down the other
 
03:45:36.429 --> 03:45:36.439 align:start position:0%
attachments the other wire that other
 
03:45:36.439 --> 03:45:38.670 align:start position:0%
attachments the other wire that other
words

03:45:38.670 --> 03:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
words
 
03:45:41.469 --> 03:45:41.479 align:start position:0%
copper so I think that scenario is
 
03:45:44.309 --> 03:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
probably more appropriately directed to
 
03:45:47.790 --> 03:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
a company that has utilized that that
 
03:45:50.269 --> 03:45:50.279 align:start position:0%
copper based technology before I I'll
 
03:45:54.790 --> 03:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
say that when we um when it is necessary
 
03:45:58.189 --> 03:45:58.199 align:start position:0%
for us to add infrastructure to our
 
03:46:01.510 --> 03:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
existing network uh we typically add
 
03:46:03.950 --> 03:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
that infrastructure by
 
03:46:06.830 --> 03:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
overlash uh that new infrastructure
 
03:46:09.670 --> 03:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
whether it be fiber optic cabling or
 
03:46:15.269 --> 03:46:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:17.950 --> 03:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
attachments could may I ask for
 
03:46:20.630 --> 03:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
clarification yes go ahead could you
 
03:46:24.070 --> 03:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
explain what lashing is oh sure I
 
03:46:29.670 --> 03:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
apologize um so over lashing is uh when
 
03:46:34.510 --> 03:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
um a a company needs to uh secure if you
 
03:46:37.750 --> 03:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
will infrastructure to the carrying
 
03:46:40.910 --> 03:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
cable that is attached to to the utility
 
03:46:45.149 --> 03:46:45.159 align:start position:0%
pole and that uh attachment that over
 
03:46:48.630 --> 03:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
lashing is accomplished by uh the use of
 
03:46:52.389 --> 03:46:52.399 align:start position:0%
a wire which is wrapped uh around that
 
03:46:56.349 --> 03:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
carrying cable and potentially other
 
03:46:58.670 --> 03:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
wires that are already there so as to
 
03:47:02.630 --> 03:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
secure them to the uh both the
 
03:47:04.550 --> 03:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
attachment on the pole and the carrying
 
03:47:08.510 --> 03:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
cable that supports the uh the
 
03:47:10.710 --> 03:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Mr chair may I ask a
 
03:47:10.720 --> 03:47:11.670 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Mr chair may I ask a
second

03:47:11.670 --> 03:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:47:16.790 --> 03:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
question okay go ahead what is can you
 
03:47:16.800 --> 03:47:19.910 align:start position:0%
question okay go ahead what is can you
now

03:47:19.910 --> 03:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:25.269 --> 03:47:25.279 align:start position:0%
share room on fiber with other
 
03:47:27.510 --> 03:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
companies for a
 
03:47:29.469 --> 03:47:29.479 align:start position:0%
fee uh
 
03:47:32.990 --> 03:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
so can companies do it by rule of
 
03:47:36.309 --> 03:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
Regulation yes absolutely uh it's
 
03:47:40.070 --> 03:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
relatively uh common for uh companies
 
03:47:44.070 --> 03:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
that own fiber optic cabling to lease uh
 
03:47:46.990 --> 03:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
access to uh to
 
03:47:48.870 --> 03:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure thank
 
03:47:51.830 --> 03:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
you the chair recognizes representative
 
03:47:53.950 --> 03:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
oxum for a
 
03:47:56.830 --> 03:47:56.840 align:start position:0%
question yes I'm wondering if there's
 
03:47:58.910 --> 03:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
been uh do we still have representative
 
03:47:58.920 --> 03:48:01.710 align:start position:0%
been uh do we still have representative
Marsh

03:48:01.710 --> 03:48:01.720 align:start position:0%
Marsh
 
03:48:04.630 --> 03:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
available there you are my my question
 
03:48:07.910 --> 03:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
is whether you're um aware that we have
 
03:48:10.750 --> 03:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
a Broadband study committee bill before
 
03:48:12.990 --> 03:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
this committee and I'm wondering if it
 
03:48:16.550 --> 03:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
would be useful to either roll these two
 
03:48:19.630 --> 03:48:19.640 align:start position:0%
together or to at least when we have a
 
03:48:21.990 --> 03:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
this is as a question for the chair
 
03:48:23.590 --> 03:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
whether it's appropriate to ask that
 
03:48:26.790 --> 03:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
they be uh considered when we consider
 
03:48:28.790 --> 03:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
the bills at least consider these two
 
03:48:31.870 --> 03:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
bills together because they certainly
 
03:48:33.590 --> 03:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
inter intermerge and I think the
 
03:48:35.750 --> 03:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
complexities of the discussion have have
 
03:48:37.469 --> 03:48:37.479 align:start position:0%
been revealed here this is not a the
 
03:48:40.389 --> 03:48:40.399 align:start position:0%
simple bill that it looked like it has a
 
03:48:43.510 --> 03:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
lot of the issues that we see L you know
 
03:48:45.349 --> 03:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
across the board in dealing with
 
03:48:45.359 --> 03:48:46.790 align:start position:0%
across the board in dealing with
Broadband

03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
Broadband
 
03:48:48.950 --> 03:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
deployment representative Marsh you want
 
03:48:52.349 --> 03:48:52.359 align:start position:0%
a comment uh I think that the chair can
 
03:48:54.309 --> 03:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh address his bills as whatever way he
 
03:48:57.349 --> 03:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
sees fit and I recognize that it is a
 
03:48:58.630 --> 03:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
complicated problem or it would have
 
03:49:00.950 --> 03:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
been solved a long time
 
03:49:04.950 --> 03:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
ago I guess I would wonder is there any
 
03:49:09.070 --> 03:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
urgency uh on the part of the selectman
 
03:49:10.670 --> 03:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
and the residents of the town of
 
03:49:12.950 --> 03:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
Brookfield to make this happen sooner
 
03:49:15.790 --> 03:49:15.800 align:start position:0%
rather than later uh yes the answer to
 
03:49:17.910 --> 03:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
that question is
 
03:49:20.110 --> 03:49:20.120 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you uh the chair
 
03:49:20.120 --> 03:49:21.590 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you uh the chair
recognizes

03:49:21.590 --> 03:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
recognizes
 
03:49:25.990 --> 03:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:28.750 --> 03:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:49:32.309 --> 03:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr hson for taking my question um
 
03:49:34.870 --> 03:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
this is more of kind of a philosophical
 
03:49:39.510 --> 03:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
question to you um we all recognize the
 
03:49:41.710 --> 03:49:41.720 align:start position:0%
value of broadband and the need to make
 
03:49:43.990 --> 03:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
sure that everyone has access to it
 
03:49:48.269 --> 03:49:48.279 align:start position:0%
because of its value um from from your
 
03:49:51.830 --> 03:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
Vantage Point uh looking at the problems
 
03:49:53.790 --> 03:49:53.800 align:start position:0%
of trying to deploy it and make it
 
03:49:56.630 --> 03:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
accessible to everyone what do you see
 
03:50:03.590 --> 03:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:05.630 --> 03:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
obstacles besides
 
03:50:08.429 --> 03:50:08.439 align:start position:0%
poll oh I'm sorry representative oh
 
03:50:09.790 --> 03:50:09.800 align:start position:0%
besides poll
 
03:50:14.389 --> 03:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:17.030 --> 03:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
I I think that
 
03:50:20.070 --> 03:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
um one of the unsatisfactory realities
 
03:50:22.110 --> 03:50:22.120 align:start position:0%
of trying to tackle this issue is that
 
03:50:24.469 --> 03:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
there's there's no there is no Silver
 
03:50:28.269 --> 03:50:28.279 align:start position:0%
Bullet that that is offered or has been
 
03:50:32.030 --> 03:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
offered um are the the basic
 
03:50:35.229 --> 03:50:35.239 align:start position:0%
challenge that all of us have in
 
03:50:38.710 --> 03:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
deploying these networks is the
 
03:50:38.720 --> 03:50:40.110 align:start position:0%
deploying these networks is the
potential

03:50:40.110 --> 03:50:40.120 align:start position:0%
potential
 
03:50:42.590 --> 03:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
Market that exists for the products
 
03:50:44.830 --> 03:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
relative to the cost of deploying the
 
03:50:48.189 --> 03:50:48.199 align:start position:0%
product so uh efforts like this that
 
03:50:53.309 --> 03:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
seek to to address that lad element um
 
03:50:56.110 --> 03:50:56.120 align:start position:0%
is Def is certainly helpful which is why
 
03:50:59.309 --> 03:50:59.319 align:start position:0%
we we've advocated for you know both an
 
03:51:03.950 --> 03:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
approach similar to this and uh as other
 
03:51:06.950 --> 03:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
others have noted you know regulations
 
03:51:10.030 --> 03:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
that either speed or
 
03:51:14.630 --> 03:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh ease access to these these assets so
 
03:51:17.950 --> 03:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's I think it's very difficult to
 
03:51:19.429 --> 03:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
identify that
 
03:51:21.870 --> 03:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
single uh issue that that is going to
 
03:51:25.830 --> 03:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
resolve this issue it's a combination of
 
03:51:28.110 --> 03:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
uh are there customers there who can
 
03:51:31.590 --> 03:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
provide the revenue necessary to support
 
03:51:34.269 --> 03:51:34.279 align:start position:0%
the costs required to build the
 
03:51:37.710 --> 03:51:37.720 align:start position:0%
network uh that's the a very large
 
03:51:40.710 --> 03:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
equation to solve
 
03:51:42.510 --> 03:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
uh followup Mr
 
03:51:45.189 --> 03:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
CH uh quickly we have one more piece
 
03:51:47.670 --> 03:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
person who wants to speak on this bill
 
03:51:50.670 --> 03:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
uh do you see any yeah thank you uh Mr
 
03:51:53.070 --> 03:51:53.080 align:start position:0%
Hutson do you see any analogy between
 
03:51:55.910 --> 03:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
providing rural rural
 
03:51:58.389 --> 03:51:58.399 align:start position:0%
electrification to everyone in this
 
03:52:01.349 --> 03:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
country uh versus the Broadband I mean
 
03:52:04.590 --> 03:52:04.600 align:start position:0%
that was certainly a similar
 
03:52:09.110 --> 03:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
situation you know I truly I I don't see
 
03:52:11.550 --> 03:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
where we are today with Broadband
 
03:52:13.469 --> 03:52:13.479 align:start position:0%
deployment in our country or in our
 
03:52:18.309 --> 03:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
state having a offering a great analog
 
03:52:20.429 --> 03:52:20.439 align:start position:0%
between where the country was when it
 
03:52:23.469 --> 03:52:23.479 align:start position:0%
decided to uh go down the path it did
 
03:52:24.550 --> 03:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
with Rural
 
03:52:26.309 --> 03:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
electrification and the reason I say
 
03:52:30.469 --> 03:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
that is that right now uh in this state
 
03:52:31.870 --> 03:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
there's two reasons really right now in
 
03:52:35.110 --> 03:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
this state and in this country we have
 
03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
particularly in the state High 90
 
03:52:41.389 --> 03:52:41.399 align:start position:0%
percentile uh availability of broadband
 
03:52:44.990 --> 03:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
depending on what you consider Broadband
 
03:52:47.389 --> 03:52:47.399 align:start position:0%
in terms of speeds depending on exactly
 
03:52:50.070 --> 03:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
how uh or what source of information you
 
03:52:52.550 --> 03:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
use there's still we still fall
 
03:52:55.630 --> 03:52:55.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere between the low to mid90s and
 
03:52:59.389 --> 03:52:59.399 align:start position:0%
the mid to high 90s 93 to 96 7% That's
 
03:53:01.110 --> 03:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
vastly different than where we were as a
 
03:53:03.389 --> 03:53:03.399 align:start position:0%
country when we embarked on Rural
 
03:53:06.309 --> 03:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
electrification and the second issue is
 
03:53:11.070 --> 03:53:11.080 align:start position:0%
that Broadband we now have a variety of
 
03:53:13.070 --> 03:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
technologies that I think really
 
03:53:16.349 --> 03:53:16.359 align:start position:0%
indisputably deliver Broadband quality
 
03:53:20.189 --> 03:53:20.199 align:start position:0%
services we've got uh Wireless Services
 
03:53:22.830 --> 03:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
wired terrestrial services like the ones
 
03:53:26.790 --> 03:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
that concast provides you've got uh
 
03:53:28.950 --> 03:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
really more as an emerging technology
 
03:53:33.070 --> 03:53:33.080 align:start position:0%
but a proven technology as it relates to
 
03:53:35.349 --> 03:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
satellite um that's not that was not the
 
03:53:38.070 --> 03:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
case also uh when we embarked on Rural
 
03:53:41.110 --> 03:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
electrification you you don't we we have
 
03:53:42.990 --> 03:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
um just a variety of competing
 
03:53:45.469 --> 03:53:45.479 align:start position:0%
technologies that we just we didn't have
 
03:53:47.630 --> 03:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
um when that that first decision was
 
03:53:50.429 --> 03:53:50.439 align:start position:0%
made so I I think that I think those
 
03:53:55.710 --> 03:53:55.720 align:start position:0%
comparisons are are fraud um to be
 
03:53:59.429 --> 03:53:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:01.750 --> 03:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
you okay we have one more person who
 
03:54:04.070 --> 03:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
wants to speak so please make your
 
03:54:07.110 --> 03:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
questions uh quick representative McGee
 
03:54:10.309 --> 03:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
is uh recognized for a question question
 
03:54:12.950 --> 03:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
03:54:14.950 --> 03:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
hodin for taking my question my my
 
03:54:16.830 --> 03:54:16.840 align:start position:0%
question's on a similar vein I think we
 
03:54:19.950 --> 03:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony earlier about uh
 
03:54:21.349 --> 03:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
essential services that are being
 
03:54:24.710 --> 03:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
delivered to and areas that are blackout
 
03:54:28.309 --> 03:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
so if they're in that seven four to s%
 
03:54:30.990 --> 03:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
range of people who are excluded it may
 
03:54:33.110 --> 03:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
be a very small percentage but it it
 
03:54:35.710 --> 03:54:35.720 align:start position:0%
still could relate to essential services
 
03:54:37.870 --> 03:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
so I guess my question is
 
03:54:41.309 --> 03:54:41.319 align:start position:0%
um is it just about the cost proposition
 
03:54:43.469 --> 03:54:43.479 align:start position:0%
or is it about us being able to figure
 
03:54:46.630 --> 03:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
out a way to uh take what is basically
 
03:54:49.030 --> 03:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
an an essential infrastructure service
 
03:54:50.830 --> 03:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
and make it available to everyone in the
 
03:54:52.750 --> 03:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
state regardless of their
 
03:54:55.189 --> 03:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
location or or to find a way you know
 
03:54:56.630 --> 03:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
support that I mean I thought that that
 
03:54:58.710 --> 03:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
was the uh impetus for the bill although
 
03:55:01.550 --> 03:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
it relates to Brookfield in a specific
 
03:55:04.229 --> 03:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
situation it is not dissimilar from
 
03:55:07.110 --> 03:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
other small towns who also can't
 
03:55:09.750 --> 03:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
make yeah thank you representative I
 
03:55:14.110 --> 03:55:14.120 align:start position:0%
think that's correct I think that uh the
 
03:55:17.750 --> 03:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
this idea which found was germinated in
 
03:55:21.710 --> 03:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
Brookfield uh is uh is because the the
 
03:55:22.950 --> 03:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
challenge is being experienced in a
 
03:55:25.870 --> 03:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
number of small towns in the state so uh
 
03:55:27.750 --> 03:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
you I I think
 
03:55:31.070 --> 03:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
we while not a necessary solution for
 
03:55:33.670 --> 03:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
this bill I think we feel like we
 
03:55:35.710 --> 03:55:35.720 align:start position:0%
believe and we've advocated for
 
03:55:37.309 --> 03:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
Partnerships between the public sector
 
03:55:40.469 --> 03:55:40.479 align:start position:0%
and the private sector that where the
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
public sector um helps the private
 
03:55:46.429 --> 03:55:46.439 align:start position:0%
sector overcome those economic
 
03:55:49.710 --> 03:55:49.720 align:start position:0%
barriers um and uh do it in a way that
 
03:55:51.870 --> 03:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
allows all those different sorts of
 
03:55:55.469 --> 03:55:55.479 align:start position:0%
technologies that I just described to uh
 
03:55:57.229 --> 03:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
try to have a seat at the table to solve
 
03:56:00.030 --> 03:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
the problem that you know we we've we
 
03:56:02.750 --> 03:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
have the the Technology's proven the
 
03:56:06.349 --> 03:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
means of doing it the economic model is
 
03:56:09.149 --> 03:56:09.159 align:start position:0%
uh is proven the challenge is is how do
 
03:56:14.870 --> 03:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
you apply it in these uh these areas and
 
03:56:17.990 --> 03:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh and I think you know we feel like uh
 
03:56:19.830 --> 03:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
programs that allow the private sector
 
03:56:21.830 --> 03:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
and the partner the public sector to
 
03:56:24.149 --> 03:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
partner would really offer the best
 
03:56:26.910 --> 03:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity for Success followup Mr
 
03:56:29.070 --> 03:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
chairman okay thank you no I'm not going
 
03:56:30.830 --> 03:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
to allow a followup at this point
 
03:56:32.870 --> 03:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
because the discussion have strayed from
 
03:56:34.750 --> 03:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
the subject of the bill the subject of
 
03:56:37.030 --> 03:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
the bill is pole replacement and now
 
03:56:39.670 --> 03:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about Broad band expansion
 
03:56:41.670 --> 03:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
across the state that's not the subject
 
03:56:44.870 --> 03:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the bill so let's uh let's move on
 
03:56:48.110 --> 03:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
and let me call on the final speaker uh
 
03:56:49.710 --> 03:56:49.720 align:start position:0%
who wants to speak on this bill and that
 
03:56:51.110 --> 03:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
is Ellen
 
03:56:54.670 --> 03:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
scarponi and uh Miss scarponi represents
 
03:56:57.389 --> 03:56:57.399 align:start position:0%
Consolidated Communications Miss garon
 
03:57:00.229 --> 03:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
you're on good afternoon chairman Vose
 
03:57:02.149 --> 03:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
and committee members thank you for the
 
03:57:04.590 --> 03:57:04.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk to you today my name
 
03:57:06.630 --> 03:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
is Ellen scarponi and I do represent
 
03:57:09.349 --> 03:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
Consolidated Communications
 
03:57:12.269 --> 03:57:12.279 align:start position:0%
I don't want to repeat things that have
 
03:57:15.189 --> 03:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
already been testified to but I do need
 
03:57:18.149 --> 03:57:18.159 align:start position:0%
to incorporate them in this discussion
 
03:57:20.870 --> 03:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
if you'll bear with me of course there
 
03:57:23.070 --> 03:57:23.080 align:start position:0%
is a strong consensus in New Hampshire
 
03:57:24.910 --> 03:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
among the residents and businesses and
 
03:57:27.229 --> 03:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
Educators and medical providers those
 
03:57:29.229 --> 03:57:29.239 align:start position:0%
who legislate and those who regulate and
 
03:57:31.590 --> 03:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
the providers of service that adequate
 
03:57:34.229 --> 03:57:34.239 align:start position:0%
Broadband is necessary to sustain and
 
03:57:36.429 --> 03:57:36.439 align:start position:0%
expand opportunities to every corner of
 
03:57:38.389 --> 03:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
our state those are the questions that
 
03:57:40.630 --> 03:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
have been coming up Consolidated
 
03:57:43.710 --> 03:57:43.720 align:start position:0%
Communications agrees completely and we
 
03:57:46.189 --> 03:57:46.199 align:start position:0%
with that of the importance of this
 
03:57:49.110 --> 03:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
expansion and the fact that there are
 
03:57:52.030 --> 03:57:52.040 align:start position:0%
multiple ways that we need to do it we
 
03:57:55.630 --> 03:57:55.640 align:start position:0%
are currently working with over 50 towns
 
03:57:58.469 --> 03:57:58.479 align:start position:0%
counties uh municipalities and the state
 
03:58:00.990 --> 03:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
on multiple ways to expand the Broadband
 
03:58:04.269 --> 03:58:04.279 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to Municipal
 
03:58:08.590 --> 03:58:08.600 align:start position:0%
private Public Partnerships which I will
 
03:58:11.389 --> 03:58:11.399 align:start position:0%
offer to you that I will reach out to
 
03:58:13.630 --> 03:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
the representative the selectman from
 
03:58:18.550 --> 03:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
Brookfield Mr zachar to discuss um how
 
03:58:21.030 --> 03:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
these public private Partnerships are
 
03:58:25.309 --> 03:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
working um to fund the Broadband to
 
03:58:28.349 --> 03:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
unserved people in their communities
 
03:58:31.469 --> 03:58:31.479 align:start position:0%
without any tax implications for their
 
03:58:35.149 --> 03:58:35.159 align:start position:0%
town so I know he had mentioned that he
 
03:58:37.349 --> 03:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
you know that he had a quote from
 
03:58:40.349 --> 03:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
Consolidated for one .2 million but this
 
03:58:42.349 --> 03:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
was not and he said that they had to
 
03:58:44.910 --> 03:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
fund completely so I will reach out I
 
03:58:49.469 --> 03:58:49.479 align:start position:0%
promise to him to clear that up we also
 
03:58:52.110 --> 03:58:52.120 align:start position:0%
have participated in the car's funding
 
03:58:55.070 --> 03:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
for Broadband the connect America Funds
 
03:58:57.830 --> 03:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
and now the r rural digital opportunity
 
03:59:00.590 --> 03:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
fund as well as our own investments in
 
03:59:03.070 --> 03:59:03.080 align:start position:0%
transformational fiber bills when we've
 
03:59:07.189 --> 03:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
been before you in the last two years um
 
03:59:10.070 --> 03:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
there were ETS that didn't look like
 
03:59:12.590 --> 03:59:12.600 align:start position:0%
they would ever get broadband and I can
 
03:59:15.990 --> 03:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
tell you now that we have we and other
 
03:59:19.590 --> 03:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
providers now have five or two the home
 
03:59:23.349 --> 03:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
in many of these very rural communities
 
03:59:25.550 --> 03:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
so we very much support the rule the
 
03:59:27.830 --> 03:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
rapid expansion of broadband in New
 
03:59:31.870 --> 03:59:31.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and everything regarding polls
 
03:59:36.030 --> 03:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
and poll attachments has um you know is
 
03:59:38.790 --> 03:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
subject as previous speakers our
 
03:59:41.750 --> 03:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
testifiers have testified to they are
 
03:59:44.590 --> 03:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
subject to section 224 of the FCC
 
03:59:46.590 --> 03:59:46.600 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications Act of
 
03:59:49.269 --> 03:59:49.279 align:start position:0%
1996 that say that it is unreasonable
 
03:59:51.510 --> 03:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
and inconsistent for utilities to impose
 
03:59:54.110 --> 03:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
the entire cost of a poll replacement on
 
03:59:56.389 --> 03:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
a requesting attacher when the attacher
 
03:59:58.870 --> 03:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
is not the sole cause of the of the pole
 
04:00:03.910 --> 04:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
replacement and then under RSA 374 34A
 
04:00:06.149 --> 04:00:06.159 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Public Utilities
 
04:00:09.149 --> 04:00:09.159 align:start position:0%
enforces rates charges terms and itions
 
04:00:13.349 --> 04:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
as regulated under that same act 47 usc2
 
04:00:13.359 --> 04:00:14.950 align:start position:0%
as regulated under that same act 47 usc2
224

04:00:14.950 --> 04:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
224
 
04:00:17.510 --> 04:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
Consolidated again we are a
 
04:00:19.630 --> 04:00:19.640 align:start position:0%
telecommunications company that also
 
04:00:22.830 --> 04:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
owns polls we have always operated under
 
04:00:28.030 --> 04:00:28.040 align:start position:0%
this rule but we oppose HB 308 because
 
04:00:30.349 --> 04:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
this bill does not Advance Broadband
 
04:00:33.110 --> 04:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
expansion except to benefit one category
 
04:00:35.550 --> 04:00:35.560 align:start position:0%
of provider and potentially increase
 
04:00:37.910 --> 04:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
costs for the others the bill seeks to
 
04:00:40.389 --> 04:00:40.399 align:start position:0%
require that the pole owner absorb the
 
04:00:42.389 --> 04:00:42.399 align:start position:0%
cost to replace poles for new
 
04:00:45.070 --> 04:00:45.080 align:start position:0%
attachments even when the only reason
 
04:00:47.750 --> 04:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
for the pole pole replacement is the new
 
04:00:50.510 --> 04:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
attachment this is nothing new these are
 
04:00:53.229 --> 04:00:53.239 align:start position:0%
the rules that have been set out while a
 
04:00:55.790 --> 04:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
pole may or may not be fully depreciated
 
04:00:57.590 --> 04:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
if the need to replace it is driven
 
04:00:59.830 --> 04:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
solely by the new attacher the new
 
04:01:02.070 --> 04:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
attacher should bear the cost because
 
04:01:04.710 --> 04:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
but for that attachment the pole would
 
04:01:07.229 --> 04:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
not need to be
 
04:01:10.750 --> 04:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
replaced we as I say we have always
 
04:01:14.149 --> 04:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
operated under the rules from the FCC as
 
04:01:18.670 --> 04:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
endorsed by the Pu but 308 HB 308 seeds
 
04:01:20.950 --> 04:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
to shift all poll replacement costs to
 
04:01:22.950 --> 04:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
the poll owner regardless of the reason
 
04:01:25.149 --> 04:01:25.159 align:start position:0%
for the replacement so we asked the
 
04:01:28.710 --> 04:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
committee find HB 308 inexpedient to
 
04:01:31.349 --> 04:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
legislate now that's my formal testimony
 
04:01:34.269 --> 04:01:34.279 align:start position:0%
and I will submit this in writing but
 
04:01:36.990 --> 04:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any of the questions
 
04:01:39.670 --> 04:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
um or get or provide clarification for
 
04:01:41.710 --> 04:01:41.720 align:start position:0%
questions that have come up during this
 
04:01:43.830 --> 04:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
conversation this hearing today thank
 
04:01:45.110 --> 04:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
you very
 
04:01:48.469 --> 04:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
much thank you Miss garon before we take
 
04:01:51.750 --> 04:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
any questions I'm going
 
04:01:56.309 --> 04:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
to open the public hearing on HB
 
04:01:59.910 --> 04:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
371 and recess that hearing for the time
 
04:02:02.630 --> 04:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
being now I will
 
04:02:05.110 --> 04:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Cali pittz for
 
04:02:05.120 --> 04:02:06.349 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Cali pittz for
a

04:02:06.349 --> 04:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:02:09.830 --> 04:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
question hi Ellen it's nice to see you
 
04:02:14.630 --> 04:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
again this is Jackie hi you too
 
04:02:17.349 --> 04:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
question I would like you to clarify the
 
04:02:20.349 --> 04:02:20.359 align:start position:0%
definition of served and access there
 
04:02:23.110 --> 04:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
was a time when we said people had no
 
04:02:28.269 --> 04:02:28.279 align:start position:0%
access but what it was was they had in
 
04:02:31.950 --> 04:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
um inadequate speeds so could you just
 
04:02:35.469 --> 04:02:35.479 align:start position:0%
clarify those two defin definitions
 
04:02:40.510 --> 04:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
please um I I I can't I I hope I can yes
 
04:02:43.830 --> 04:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
when we talked in the past early days of
 
04:02:47.670 --> 04:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
broadband there were issues in terms of
 
04:02:52.469 --> 04:02:52.479 align:start position:0%
the unserved people who did not have um
 
04:02:55.790 --> 04:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
adequate Broadband to or the unserved
 
04:02:58.110 --> 04:02:58.120 align:start position:0%
they didn't have any Broadband if you
 
04:03:01.710 --> 04:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
will we did put in definition and it is
 
04:03:05.630 --> 04:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
in statute now that there is a
 
04:03:08.990 --> 04:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
speed uh requirement a minimum
 
04:03:11.750 --> 04:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
requirement um that was established by
 
04:03:15.030 --> 04:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
the FCC a couple of years ago of what we
 
04:03:19.469 --> 04:03:19.479 align:start position:0%
call 253 25 megabits uh download F uh 3
 
04:03:22.870 --> 04:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
megabits uploads and those were speeds
 
04:03:25.469 --> 04:03:25.479 align:start position:0%
um that the SEC at that point felt were
 
04:03:28.110 --> 04:03:28.120 align:start position:0%
sufficient uh when we have done
 
04:03:31.269 --> 04:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
legislation in the last year uh it was
 
04:03:33.149 --> 04:03:33.159 align:start position:0%
recognized that
 
04:03:36.189 --> 04:03:36.199 align:start position:0%
253 uh is not future proof and that
 
04:03:38.590 --> 04:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
there should be some room
 
04:03:43.070 --> 04:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
for allowing uh expansion of broadband
 
04:03:45.389 --> 04:03:45.399 align:start position:0%
and the UN and the unserved definition
 
04:03:48.149 --> 04:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
should be what the FCC would then
 
04:03:51.389 --> 04:03:51.399 align:start position:0%
currently um have defined so that number
 
04:03:56.710 --> 04:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
can move um the underserved are people
 
04:03:59.990 --> 04:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
who might have some level of broadband
 
04:04:03.550 --> 04:04:03.560 align:start position:0%
but again it does not reach that speed
 
04:04:07.830 --> 04:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
level and I will tell you that although
 
04:04:10.269 --> 04:04:10.279 align:start position:0%
when the municip and and this committee
 
04:04:13.710 --> 04:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
was in involved way back when in the
 
04:04:17.630 --> 04:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
municipal Broadband bonding uh
 
04:04:20.670 --> 04:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
legislation and uh it was also in front
 
04:04:22.830 --> 04:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
of a number of other committees but what
 
04:04:25.429 --> 04:04:25.439 align:start position:0%
that did a couple of years ago was Ena
 
04:04:25.439 --> 04:04:26.990 align:start position:0%
that did a couple of years ago was Ena
towns

04:04:26.990 --> 04:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
towns
 
04:04:30.309 --> 04:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
to request they they could put out a
 
04:04:34.269 --> 04:04:34.279 align:start position:0%
request for proposal for networks that
 
04:04:36.670 --> 04:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
applied what they needed in their
 
04:04:38.790 --> 04:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
community so let's let's say it is the
 
04:04:41.550 --> 04:04:41.560 align:start position:0%
rural community of Brookfield and they
 
04:04:45.469 --> 04:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
have a uh they not even all of their
 
04:04:49.590 --> 04:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
residents have access to broadband they
 
04:04:52.349 --> 04:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
could put out a request for information
 
04:04:55.469 --> 04:04:55.479 align:start position:0%
to all providers to say where are those
 
04:04:58.750 --> 04:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
areas that are unserved as the FC
 
04:05:02.189 --> 04:05:02.199 align:start position:0%
current FCC uh definition is and they
 
04:05:05.750 --> 04:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
could then decide as a community to put
 
04:05:08.830 --> 04:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
out a request for proposal to all
 
04:05:12.229 --> 04:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
providers of broadband and they can
 
04:05:14.830 --> 04:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
tailor made this is local control they
 
04:05:18.229 --> 04:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
can say in their RFP we don't want it to
 
04:05:23.110 --> 04:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
just be 25 by3 we want it to be 100
 
04:05:25.550 --> 04:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
symmetrical we want it to be a gigabit
 
04:05:27.510 --> 04:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
they could go for anything to uh
 
04:05:30.429 --> 04:05:30.439 align:start position:0%
representative oxham question before
 
04:05:33.269 --> 04:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
they can say they only want fiber and
 
04:05:36.070 --> 04:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
then they get responses back from
 
04:05:38.389 --> 04:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
providers and all of us who are are on
 
04:05:40.670 --> 04:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
this call who have testified are those
 
04:05:44.269 --> 04:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
providers who can respond and then they
 
04:05:49.349 --> 04:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
can bond for that and work with the
 
04:05:53.830 --> 04:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
provider on how that bond is paid for so
 
04:05:56.510 --> 04:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
long answer representative I apologize
 
04:05:58.389 --> 04:05:58.399 align:start position:0%
but did I answer your
 
04:06:01.189 --> 04:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
question yes but may I follow
 
04:06:05.269 --> 04:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
up okay follow up when we did
 
04:06:08.590 --> 04:06:08.600 align:start position:0%
um and I just like a yes and know did
 
04:06:10.469 --> 04:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
gasoline we said you know when they put
 
04:06:13.429 --> 04:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
an octane on a gasoline it means that's
 
04:06:15.189 --> 04:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
the minimal you can get but it doesn't
 
04:06:16.950 --> 04:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
mean that you don't get more of an
 
04:06:22.189 --> 04:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
octane so can you push speeds through
 
04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
current wires so that you can up the
 
04:06:27.550 --> 04:06:27.560 align:start position:0%
accents and I know the charge goes up
 
04:06:30.309 --> 04:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
with that but can you do
 
04:06:33.590 --> 04:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
that can that be done on existing uh
 
04:06:36.750 --> 04:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and the existing media um
 
04:06:40.070 --> 04:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
it it it can be with with electronics
 
04:06:43.389 --> 04:06:43.399 align:start position:0%
however I will tell you that um I don't
 
04:06:46.950 --> 04:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
know of any town that has asked for
 
04:06:49.950 --> 04:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
bigger speeds on our copper
 
04:06:51.950 --> 04:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that they are all looking
 
04:06:54.429 --> 04:06:54.439 align:start position:0%
for quotes on fiber for
 
04:06:56.590 --> 04:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
the okay thank
 
04:06:59.870 --> 04:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative cran
 
04:07:02.070 --> 04:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
acknowledged for a
 
04:07:04.790 --> 04:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman Bose and
 
04:07:06.670 --> 04:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss carpon for taking my
 
04:07:09.269 --> 04:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
question um I just wanted to ask for
 
04:07:13.229 --> 04:07:13.239 align:start position:0%
clarification on the statement um if but
 
04:07:15.910 --> 04:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
for the need for a new service a poll
 
04:07:18.389 --> 04:07:18.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need replacing is there
 
04:07:20.670 --> 04:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
anything at all in the definition for
 
04:07:23.389 --> 04:07:23.399 align:start position:0%
pole replacement of
 
04:07:26.630 --> 04:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm just wondering why not
 
04:07:30.070 --> 04:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
having space for a new necessary
 
04:07:32.109 --> 04:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
function is not part of the definition
 
04:07:34.389 --> 04:07:34.399 align:start position:0%
of a pole meeting replacement does that
 
04:07:36.349 --> 04:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
make sense I'm trying to trying to
 
04:07:39.910 --> 04:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
formulate that question well the if you
 
04:07:45.149 --> 04:07:45.159 align:start position:0%
look at polls as uh uh Mr hodon had said
 
04:07:48.870 --> 04:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
a pole is and the attachments are
 
04:07:51.630 --> 04:07:51.640 align:start position:0%
engineered to the nth degree to
 
04:07:54.910 --> 04:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
determine what the capacity is for the
 
04:07:58.149 --> 04:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
electric on top and how heavy literally
 
04:08:01.070 --> 04:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
how heavy those wires are going to be
 
04:08:04.870 --> 04:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
and then the T usually it's the uh
 
04:08:07.429 --> 04:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
telephone utility as as Mr hudon said
 
04:08:10.830 --> 04:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
that on the bottom and then there are
 
04:08:14.309 --> 04:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
specific safety concerns and electrical
 
04:08:16.710 --> 04:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
concerns that determine the space
 
04:08:19.990 --> 04:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
between Communications attachments and
 
04:08:23.830 --> 04:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
how many of them can be in that space
 
04:08:27.109 --> 04:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
when that space runs out you know used
 
04:08:29.510 --> 04:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
to be that there was only it used to be
 
04:08:31.870 --> 04:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
there was only Power there was telephone
 
04:08:34.510 --> 04:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
and then there was cable and now we have
 
04:08:36.870 --> 04:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
all of these other providers needing
 
04:08:40.630 --> 04:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
attachments well the the engineering of
 
04:08:43.830 --> 04:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
these poles has to be first and foremost
 
04:08:47.149 --> 04:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
for safety and so if it is determined
 
04:08:50.349 --> 04:08:50.359 align:start position:0%
that there is not enough space in there
 
04:08:53.149 --> 04:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
regardless of what that attacher is who
 
04:08:56.429 --> 04:08:56.439 align:start position:0%
that attacher is whether it's it's cable
 
04:09:00.469 --> 04:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
or electric or you know wh whomever it
 
04:09:01.910 --> 04:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
there are times when poles have to be
 
04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
replaced because electric is upgrading
 
04:09:08.189 --> 04:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
but there
 
04:09:10.630 --> 04:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
that that is part as I say of the FCC
 
04:09:14.990 --> 04:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
rules and the puc rules um that
 
04:09:18.710 --> 04:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
attachments themselves are not reason
 
04:09:18.720 --> 04:09:19.870 align:start position:0%
attachments themselves are not reason
the

04:09:19.870 --> 04:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:09:23.870 --> 04:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
attachment is the reason to upgrade the
 
04:09:28.550 --> 04:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
pole but it should not be borne by the
 
04:09:32.070 --> 04:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
pole owner because if they didn't want
 
04:09:34.349 --> 04:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
to attach then we wouldn't need to
 
04:09:36.510 --> 04:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
replace the pole does that answer your
 
04:09:36.520 --> 04:09:38.750 align:start position:0%
replace the pole does that answer your
question

04:09:38.750 --> 04:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:09:44.309 --> 04:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:47.269 --> 04:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
so okay thank you
 
04:09:50.070 --> 04:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
um seeing that there are no further
 
04:09:52.830 --> 04:09:52.840 align:start position:0%
questions I would like to uh close this
 
04:09:54.590 --> 04:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing so we can move on to the
 
04:09:56.790 --> 04:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
next one which is now 10 minutes
 
04:09:59.229 --> 04:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
overdue and I will close it by
 
04:10:01.269 --> 04:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
announcing that there were 14 people who
 
04:10:04.750 --> 04:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
signed in in support of this legislation
 
04:10:06.790 --> 04:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
there were three who signed in in
 
04:10:06.800 --> 04:10:08.189 align:start position:0%
there were three who signed in in
opposition

04:10:08.189 --> 04:10:08.199 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
we had elected officials representative
 
04:10:15.229 --> 04:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
Brody Dees signing in in
 
04:10:17.750 --> 04:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
support representative Carol Crawford
 
04:10:20.710 --> 04:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
signing in in support representative
 
04:10:24.389 --> 04:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
John McDonald signing in in support and
 
04:10:27.750 --> 04:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative laa maputi signing in in
 
04:10:30.710 --> 04:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
support so with that we will close the
 
04:10:32.950 --> 04:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB
 
04:10:36.870 --> 04:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
308 and we will open or resume the
 
04:10:38.109 --> 04:10:38.119 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
04:10:41.149 --> 04:10:41.159 align:start position:0%
on HB
 
04:10:41.159 --> 04:10:42.990 align:start position:0%
on HB
371

04:10:42.990 --> 04:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
371
 
04:10:46.790 --> 04:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
and once again uh representative
 
04:10:49.670 --> 04:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
Harrington who is the Prime sponsor of
 
04:10:53.469 --> 04:10:53.479 align:start position:0%
this legislation has not uh been able to
 
04:10:57.149 --> 04:10:57.159 align:start position:0%
join us quite yet so
 
04:11:01.309 --> 04:11:01.319 align:start position:0%
uh the other sponsor of this
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:13.469 --> 04:11:13.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:24.149 --> 04:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:27.630 --> 04:11:27.640 align:start position:0%
here so this legislation was requested
 
04:11:31.189 --> 04:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
by the consumer
 
04:11:34.070 --> 04:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
Advocate both he and I have a concern
 
04:11:38.229 --> 04:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
about uh some text we read in in
 
04:11:41.189 --> 04:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
a uh proceeding of the Public Utilities
 
04:11:43.550 --> 04:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
Commission that took place in October
 
04:11:45.790 --> 04:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
with regard to the Energy Efficiency
 
04:11:50.429 --> 04:11:50.439 align:start position:0%
resource standard trianium U Energy
 
04:11:54.109 --> 04:11:54.119 align:start position:0%
Efficiency plan in which the commission
 
04:11:57.070 --> 04:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
uh said that some of its proceedings are
 
04:11:57.080 --> 04:11:59.070 align:start position:0%
uh said that some of its proceedings are
quazi

04:11:59.070 --> 04:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
quazi
 
04:12:02.910 --> 04:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
legislative and that made me nervous and
 
04:12:04.830 --> 04:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
it apparently made the consumer Advocate
 
04:12:08.109 --> 04:12:08.119 align:start position:0%
nervous as well and uh
 
04:12:10.429 --> 04:12:10.439 align:start position:0%
so he asked representative Harrington
 
04:12:12.750 --> 04:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
and I if we would file this bill which
 
04:12:16.229 --> 04:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
basically says that uh all of the
 
04:12:19.630 --> 04:12:19.640 align:start position:0%
commission's proceedings that affect
 
04:12:20.830 --> 04:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
rates and
 
04:12:26.109 --> 04:12:26.119 align:start position:0%
charges uh have to be done as uh
 
04:12:28.710 --> 04:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceedings in other words
 
04:12:31.030 --> 04:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
they're like Court proceedings where
 
04:12:34.670 --> 04:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
testimonies and findings of fact are um
 
04:12:37.750 --> 04:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
submitted as evidence
 
04:12:40.309 --> 04:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
um and the consumer Advocate will
 
04:12:42.550 --> 04:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
explain in more detail what he means by
 
04:12:45.790 --> 04:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
that um but it's a fairly simple and
 
04:12:45.800 --> 04:12:47.030 align:start position:0%
that um but it's a fairly simple and
straightforward

04:12:47.030 --> 04:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
04:12:50.030 --> 04:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
change to legislation but an extremely
 
04:12:50.040 --> 04:12:51.109 align:start position:0%
change to legislation but an extremely
important

04:12:51.109 --> 04:12:51.119 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:12:54.790 --> 04:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
one and so uh I'm not going to say any
 
04:12:57.950 --> 04:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
further on the subject and I will refer
 
04:13:00.750 --> 04:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
all questions to the consumer advocate
 
04:13:04.229 --> 04:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
so if you will hold your questions I
 
04:13:06.510 --> 04:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
will turn the matter over to the
 
04:13:09.070 --> 04:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
consumer ad advate Don Cree who will
 
04:13:10.389 --> 04:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
explain it
 
04:13:13.790 --> 04:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
in great detail he submitted written
 
04:13:16.630 --> 04:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
testimony which was voluminous in its
 
04:13:19.910 --> 04:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
detail and excellent as usual but he
 
04:13:23.469 --> 04:13:23.479 align:start position:0%
will summarize that for you and
 
04:13:27.109 --> 04:13:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh give the bill it's due so don CH
 
04:13:30.750 --> 04:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
please take it away uh thank you uh
 
04:13:32.710 --> 04:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose first of all thanks to you
 
04:13:34.229 --> 04:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
and to representative Harrington for
 
04:13:36.510 --> 04:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
agreeing to introduce this bill and
 
04:13:38.149 --> 04:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for this opportunity to
 
04:13:41.309 --> 04:13:41.319 align:start position:0%
explain to uh everybody on the committee
 
04:13:44.590 --> 04:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
why I think this bill is important uh as
 
04:13:46.429 --> 04:13:46.439 align:start position:0%
you all know my job is to represent the
 
04:13:48.149 --> 04:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
interests of residential utility
 
04:13:50.229 --> 04:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
customers but but really what's
 
04:13:53.309 --> 04:13:53.319 align:start position:0%
informing my interest in this bill is as
 
04:13:55.710 --> 04:13:55.720 align:start position:0%
much about that as it is about my
 
04:13:57.670 --> 04:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
background as a teacher of
 
04:13:59.590 --> 04:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
administrative law I've taught that
 
04:14:02.149 --> 04:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
subject at Vermont law school earlier in
 
04:14:04.910 --> 04:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
my career and also uh my experience
 
04:14:06.710 --> 04:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
serving as the general Council of the
 
04:14:10.469 --> 04:14:10.479 align:start position:0%
public Utilities Commission um the first
 
04:14:12.790 --> 04:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
point I have to make about this bill is
 
04:14:14.590 --> 04:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
that in my opinion and this is very
 
04:14:17.070 --> 04:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
important this bill that representative
 
04:14:19.030 --> 04:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
Harrington and representative Vose have
 
04:14:22.870 --> 04:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
introduced clarifies existing law I
 
04:14:24.670 --> 04:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
believe the Public Utilities Commission
 
04:14:28.429 --> 04:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
has made a mistake of law that we will
 
04:14:30.990 --> 04:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
attempt to correct through the Appellate
 
04:14:34.109 --> 04:14:34.119 align:start position:0%
process if necessary but in the meantime
 
04:14:35.309 --> 04:14:35.319 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington and
 
04:14:37.790 --> 04:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
representative Vose graciously agreed to
 
04:14:40.429 --> 04:14:40.439 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill as a way of making
 
04:14:43.070 --> 04:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
what I consider to be existing law
 
04:14:45.510 --> 04:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely clear to the folks at the
 
04:14:47.109 --> 04:14:47.119 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and
 
04:14:50.510 --> 04:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
everybody else so the Public Utilities
 
04:14:53.189 --> 04:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
Commission like most if not all
 
04:14:53.199 --> 04:14:54.710 align:start position:0%
Commission like most if not all
administrative

04:14:54.710 --> 04:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
04:14:57.590 --> 04:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
agencies uh has the responsibility from
 
04:15:00.910 --> 04:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
time to time to make determinations that
 
04:15:04.070 --> 04:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
establish the legal rights duties or
 
04:15:06.830 --> 04:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
privileges of people out in the world
 
04:15:09.710 --> 04:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
and by people I mean both actual and
 
04:15:12.790 --> 04:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
virtual people meaning human beings and
 
04:15:15.109 --> 04:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
entities formed by human beings so the
 
04:15:17.710 --> 04:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
Pu makes decisions that affect the legal
 
04:15:20.870 --> 04:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
rights duties or privileges of people
 
04:15:23.870 --> 04:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
and there are really two flavors that
 
04:15:26.189 --> 04:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
the commission can use for its
 
04:15:28.469 --> 04:15:28.479 align:start position:0%
decision-making there's vanilla and
 
04:15:31.309 --> 04:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
there's chocolate so by Vanilla I mean
 
04:15:33.750 --> 04:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
the commission can promulgate rules
 
04:15:37.670 --> 04:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's called Rule making and rules are
 
04:15:41.269 --> 04:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
uh requirements that apply generally to
 
04:15:43.750 --> 04:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
everybody and then there's chocolate
 
04:15:45.670 --> 04:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
flavor decision-making and that is
 
04:15:48.349 --> 04:15:48.359 align:start position:0%
adjudication and as representative Vose
 
04:15:50.910 --> 04:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
just explained to you adjudication when
 
04:15:52.990 --> 04:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission or any
 
04:15:55.429 --> 04:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
administrative agency is conducting
 
04:15:55.439 --> 04:15:57.349 align:start position:0%
administrative agency is conducting
audification

04:15:57.349 --> 04:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
audification
 
04:16:00.469 --> 04:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
adjudication it really is uh making
 
04:16:03.349 --> 04:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
decisions that resemble the way courts
 
04:16:03.359 --> 04:16:04.189 align:start position:0%
decisions that resemble the way courts
make

04:16:04.189 --> 04:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
make
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
decisions and so you have your vanilla
 
04:16:09.030 --> 04:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
you have your chocolate but then for
 
04:16:10.910 --> 04:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
some reason the Public Utilities
 
04:16:13.229 --> 04:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
Commission has decided to attempt to
 
04:16:16.790 --> 04:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
invent strawberry and by strawberry I
 
04:16:19.189 --> 04:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
mean what the commission described in
 
04:16:21.309 --> 04:16:21.319 align:start position:0%
the order the chairman Vose referenced
 
04:16:24.229 --> 04:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
back in October as a quote unquote
 
04:16:27.429 --> 04:16:27.439 align:start position:0%
legislative docket well I I'm here to
 
04:16:30.269 --> 04:16:30.279 align:start position:0%
say that that is not consistent with
 
04:16:32.710 --> 04:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
established principles of administrative
 
04:16:35.469 --> 04:16:35.479 align:start position:0%
law uh uh the Public Utilities
 
04:16:38.109 --> 04:16:38.119 align:start position:0%
Commission and administ ative agencies
 
04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
do have the right and obligation to
 
04:16:42.590 --> 04:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
conduct quote unquote legislative
 
04:16:45.469 --> 04:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
proceedings that is what a rule making
 
04:16:48.950 --> 04:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
is that's what rule making is a form of
 
04:16:51.389 --> 04:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
legislating and it is legislative
 
04:16:53.990 --> 04:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
Authority that has been delegated by you
 
04:16:56.469 --> 04:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
the general court to the administrative
 
04:17:00.149 --> 04:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
agency now we all thought and by we I
 
04:17:02.030 --> 04:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
think pretty much everybody who
 
04:17:03.349 --> 04:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
practices in front of the Public
 
04:17:05.870 --> 04:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission thought that rate
 
04:17:10.070 --> 04:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
proceedings uh were adjudicative until
 
04:17:11.469 --> 04:17:11.479 align:start position:0%
uh the Public Utilities Commission
 
04:17:15.030 --> 04:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
issued this order in October saying that
 
04:17:16.790 --> 04:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
the proceeding it was ruling in which
 
04:17:19.590 --> 04:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
has to do with the Energy Efficiency uh
 
04:17:21.790 --> 04:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
CH part of the system benefits charge
 
04:17:23.469 --> 04:17:23.479 align:start position:0%
but not just that but any rate
 
04:17:25.950 --> 04:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
proceeding is really legislative in
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
nature and as I explained in my uh
 
04:17:30.910 --> 04:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
written testimony I think that proceeds
 
04:17:33.670 --> 04:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
from an erroneous application of case
 
04:17:35.790 --> 04:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
law that's that just talks about the
 
04:17:38.950 --> 04:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
fact that when an agency acts it is
 
04:17:41.469 --> 04:17:41.479 align:start position:0%
acting pursuant to delegated legislative
 
04:17:43.870 --> 04:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
Authority that's informative when it
 
04:17:46.750 --> 04:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
comes to the nature of the power that an
 
04:17:48.950 --> 04:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
administrative agency wields but it's
 
04:17:51.910 --> 04:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
not informative about how the agency has
 
04:17:54.070 --> 04:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
to make its decisions and as I said
 
04:17:57.149 --> 04:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
before there's vanilla there's chocolate
 
04:17:59.630 --> 04:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
there is no such thing as strawberry
 
04:18:02.349 --> 04:18:02.359 align:start position:0%
there's Ru making there's a judication
 
04:18:04.790 --> 04:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
period now as I mentioned in my written
 
04:18:07.870 --> 04:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
testimony not every decision that an
 
04:18:10.870 --> 04:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
agency makes has to be either rulemaking
 
04:18:12.950 --> 04:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
or adjudication because agencies make
 
04:18:15.870 --> 04:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
decisions all the time that don't affect
 
04:18:18.670 --> 04:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
the legal rights duties or privileges of
 
04:18:20.070 --> 04:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
people with business in front of the
 
04:18:22.630 --> 04:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
agency and I gave you a couple of uh
 
04:18:24.349 --> 04:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
somewhat Whimsical
 
04:18:27.389 --> 04:18:27.399 align:start position:0%
examples I think that allowing the
 
04:18:30.790 --> 04:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission to uh
 
04:18:33.469 --> 04:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
basically adjudicate or determine the
 
04:18:36.269 --> 04:18:36.279 align:start position:0%
legal rights duties or privileges uh
 
04:18:37.910 --> 04:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
through this third flavor of
 
04:18:40.229 --> 04:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
decision-making is bad for both the
 
04:18:43.030 --> 04:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
customers and the utility shareholders
 
04:18:46.229 --> 04:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
whose interests the Pu is supposed to uh
 
04:18:48.469 --> 04:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
serve as the Arbiter between and why do
 
04:18:51.670 --> 04:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
I say that well in
 
04:18:54.510 --> 04:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
a quazi legislative or legislative
 
04:18:57.030 --> 04:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
docket unlike in an adjudicative docket
 
04:18:59.349 --> 04:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
there's no definitive record and what's
 
04:19:00.910 --> 04:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
important about an adjudicative
 
04:19:03.229 --> 04:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
proceeding is that the commission has to
 
04:19:05.710 --> 04:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
make its decision based on an
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
established body of evidence that has
 
04:19:10.510 --> 04:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
been formally admitted into the record
 
04:19:13.030 --> 04:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh now in a legislative proceeding such
 
04:19:15.670 --> 04:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
as the one we're in right now we don't
 
04:19:17.109 --> 04:19:17.119 align:start position:0%
base you don't have to base your
 
04:19:19.550 --> 04:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
decision on a definite record but as I
 
04:19:22.189 --> 04:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
explained in my written testimony there
 
04:19:23.630 --> 04:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
there's a different mechanism for
 
04:19:25.710 --> 04:19:25.720 align:start position:0%
constraining you and that is called
 
04:19:28.750 --> 04:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
elections right like if you folks make
 
04:19:31.389 --> 04:19:31.399 align:start position:0%
decisions that are improvident for some
 
04:19:33.429 --> 04:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
reason you have to answer to your voters
 
04:19:35.510 --> 04:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
for that but an administrative agency
 
04:19:37.469 --> 04:19:37.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to do that
 
04:19:40.830 --> 04:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
uh in an adjudicative proceeding there
 
04:19:43.349 --> 04:19:43.359 align:start position:0%
is a very strict rule against exp parte
 
04:19:45.710 --> 04:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
contact I can't call up the chair of the
 
04:19:48.349 --> 04:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
Pu and say chairwoman Martin I don't
 
04:19:50.309 --> 04:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
want you to decide this case that's
 
04:19:51.870 --> 04:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
pending before you in a certain way
 
04:19:53.630 --> 04:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
because I think it's bad for rate payers
 
04:19:55.790 --> 04:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
not allowed to do that but in a quazi
 
04:19:58.269 --> 04:19:58.279 align:start position:0%
legislative proceeding uh I suppose I
 
04:20:00.710 --> 04:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
could do that and again as I explained
 
04:20:03.990 --> 04:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
in my written testimony in a so-called
 
04:20:05.550 --> 04:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
legislative docket that isn't a
 
04:20:08.269 --> 04:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
rulemaking there's really no way for the
 
04:20:11.269 --> 04:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
state supreme court in an appellate
 
04:20:14.070 --> 04:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
context meaning if I appeal a decision
 
04:20:15.309 --> 04:20:15.319 align:start position:0%
that I don't like or one of the
 
04:20:16.910 --> 04:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
utilities does there's really no
 
04:20:19.189 --> 04:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
standard for the appell court to apply
 
04:20:21.189 --> 04:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
to determine whether it's going to
 
04:20:26.030 --> 04:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
affirm or overturn the pu's decision now
 
04:20:27.870 --> 04:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
there's another uh Little slice of this
 
04:20:30.550 --> 04:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
that I did not mention in my uh written
 
04:20:33.630 --> 04:20:33.640 align:start position:0%
testimony and that has to do with RSA
 
04:20:38.070 --> 04:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
36317 C so section 17 C of chapter RSA
 
04:20:41.070 --> 04:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
363 and what that statute says is that
 
04:20:43.670 --> 04:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
when the Pu conducts adjudication its
 
04:20:45.510 --> 04:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
deliberations do not have to be
 
04:20:47.990 --> 04:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
conducted in public and that is an
 
04:20:50.269 --> 04:20:50.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate way of allowing the
 
04:20:53.189 --> 04:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
commission to determine its decisions in
 
04:20:55.229 --> 04:20:55.239 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceedings because it has
 
04:20:57.990 --> 04:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
to issue a formal decision based on an
 
04:21:00.269 --> 04:21:00.279 align:start position:0%
established and defined body of evidence
 
04:21:02.670 --> 04:21:02.680 align:start position:0%
and it has to explain both in terms of
 
04:21:05.349 --> 04:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
fact and the law what it's what the
 
04:21:08.790 --> 04:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
basis of its decision is in another kind
 
04:21:11.229 --> 04:21:11.239 align:start position:0%
of proceeding you know you really do
 
04:21:13.269 --> 04:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
need the commission to deliberate in
 
04:21:15.830 --> 04:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
public as any agency is required to
 
04:21:17.750 --> 04:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
deliberate in public under the right to
 
04:21:21.630 --> 04:21:21.640 align:start position:0%
no law so this new flavor of uh uh
 
04:21:23.189 --> 04:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
decision-making that the Pu has
 
04:21:25.950 --> 04:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
announced runs smack up against RSA
 
04:21:29.670 --> 04:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
36317 C and I contend that if the Pu is
 
04:21:31.950 --> 04:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
going to do that uh and it's going to be
 
04:21:34.149 --> 04:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that it at the very least
 
04:21:35.910 --> 04:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
has to conduct its deliberations in
 
04:21:35.920 --> 04:21:36.950 align:start position:0%
has to conduct its deliberations in
public

04:21:36.950 --> 04:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:21:39.950 --> 04:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion I warmly recommend that
 
04:21:42.510 --> 04:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
you read my fairly lengthy written
 
04:21:44.590 --> 04:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
testimony about this bill because I
 
04:21:47.990 --> 04:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
elaborated on these principles to the
 
04:21:49.590 --> 04:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
maximum extent that any of you could
 
04:21:51.189 --> 04:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
possibly be interested in learning about
 
04:21:53.590 --> 04:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
them but in closing I again want to
 
04:21:56.750 --> 04:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
clarify for for purposes of establishing
 
04:21:59.910 --> 04:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
a unassailably clear legislative record
 
04:22:02.910 --> 04:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
that in my opinion this bill clarifies
 
04:22:05.389 --> 04:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
existing law and I asked for its
 
04:22:07.990 --> 04:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
introduction as a way of making sure
 
04:22:10.590 --> 04:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
that existing law cannot be subject to
 
04:22:13.870 --> 04:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
erroneous interpretation so I think with
 
04:22:16.469 --> 04:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
that I will conclude again with my
 
04:22:18.070 --> 04:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
thanks for the opportunity to talk to
 
04:22:20.510 --> 04:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
you and to uh have this bill come before
 
04:22:23.389 --> 04:22:23.399 align:start position:0%
you I would be delighted to answer any
 
04:22:25.950 --> 04:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
questions that the chairman might allow
 
04:22:28.830 --> 04:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
to be tendered to
 
04:22:32.349 --> 04:22:32.359 align:start position:0%
me thank you Mr Greece I'm disappointed
 
04:22:35.550 --> 04:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
that there's no one here from the Pu to
 
04:22:38.710 --> 04:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh testify on on this bill or to answer
 
04:22:41.109 --> 04:22:41.119 align:start position:0%
questions but that appears to be the
 
04:22:43.670 --> 04:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
case but we do have uh Representatives
 
04:22:45.550 --> 04:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
who want to ask questions and the first
 
04:22:47.710 --> 04:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
one is representative McGee you're
 
04:22:49.349 --> 04:22:49.359 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
04:22:52.070 --> 04:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:22:54.550 --> 04:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
you consumer Advocate Cree I actually I
 
04:22:56.429 --> 04:22:56.439 align:start position:0%
did read your testimony and I have heard
 
04:22:58.189 --> 04:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
you speak about this in our dealings
 
04:23:00.510 --> 04:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
over at the Pu on occasion I think
 
04:23:02.910 --> 04:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
you've done a good job of explaining to
 
04:23:06.750 --> 04:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
us why um it's important to preserve
 
04:23:09.469 --> 04:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
chocolate and try and avoid adding
 
04:23:13.510 --> 04:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
strawberry um I guess the only question
 
04:23:18.109 --> 04:23:18.119 align:start position:0%
I would have is is there any explanation
 
04:23:20.550 --> 04:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
for why we were moving towards
 
04:23:22.469 --> 04:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
strawberry like I don't understand how
 
04:23:24.269 --> 04:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
we veered away from stuff that was
 
04:23:25.750 --> 04:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
fairly well established at the Public
 
04:23:27.109 --> 04:23:27.119 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission is there any
 
04:23:29.030 --> 04:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
backstory that that could help us
 
04:23:29.040 --> 04:23:30.149 align:start position:0%
backstory that that could help us
understand

04:23:30.149 --> 04:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
understand
 
04:23:32.670 --> 04:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative McGee for
 
04:23:35.790 --> 04:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
that extremely astute question the the
 
04:23:37.309 --> 04:23:37.319 align:start position:0%
short answer answer is I don't really
 
04:23:39.870 --> 04:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
know but the slightly longer answer is
 
04:23:42.750 --> 04:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
that my speculation is that the
 
04:23:45.710 --> 04:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
commission did not like a motion that I
 
04:23:47.830 --> 04:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
had filed that would have resulted if
 
04:23:50.910 --> 04:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
granted in the designation of certain of
 
04:23:53.630 --> 04:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
its employees in that uh Energy
 
04:23:56.189 --> 04:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
Efficiency proceeding as staff Advocates
 
04:23:59.070 --> 04:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
and that would have uh subjected them to
 
04:24:00.510 --> 04:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
or it would have prohibited them from
 
04:24:03.389 --> 04:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
having informal exp parte contact with
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners the commission never
 
04:24:07.830 --> 04:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
likes motion like that but the statute
 
04:24:10.149 --> 04:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
that authorizes those designations only
 
04:24:12.750 --> 04:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
applies in adjudicative proceedings and
 
04:24:14.429 --> 04:24:14.439 align:start position:0%
I think the commission thought that that
 
04:24:16.630 --> 04:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
would be a convenient way of getting rid
 
04:24:18.389 --> 04:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
of my motion that that's the only thing
 
04:24:21.309 --> 04:24:21.319 align:start position:0%
I can think of that that's literally how
 
04:24:23.990 --> 04:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
that decision got made in October I I
 
04:24:26.030 --> 04:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
think it was uh I think the commission
 
04:24:27.830 --> 04:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
painted itself into a corner
 
04:24:30.070 --> 04:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
improvidently but uh that's what they
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
did that's my best
 
04:24:35.149 --> 04:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
speculation uh thank you may I have a
 
04:24:39.710 --> 04:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
followup follow up thank you Mr chair um
 
04:24:42.790 --> 04:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
so I think you've tried to explain and I
 
04:24:44.630 --> 04:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
want to understand this it it seems to
 
04:24:48.030 --> 04:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
me the the agency itself tries to
 
04:24:50.189 --> 04:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
conduct itself in a way that is as
 
04:24:53.189 --> 04:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
public as possible and in conformance
 
04:24:55.550 --> 04:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
with the rsas around an agency of that
 
04:24:57.070 --> 04:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
type where it's you know it's got a lot
 
04:24:59.389 --> 04:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
of influence over what's happening with
 
04:25:03.550 --> 04:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
the utilities and all so
 
04:25:06.630 --> 04:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
um is there a particular h
 
04:25:08.189 --> 04:25:08.199 align:start position:0%
you've alluded to a number of different
 
04:25:09.710 --> 04:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
scenarios where you can see sort of a
 
04:25:12.269 --> 04:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
slippery slope happening and I guess the
 
04:25:14.670 --> 04:25:14.680 align:start position:0%
question would be can you point to
 
04:25:17.710 --> 04:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
particular harms that could occur in
 
04:25:20.429 --> 04:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
terms of these public proceedings uh
 
04:25:22.510 --> 04:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
beyond what you've already illuminated
 
04:25:27.189 --> 04:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
or um or is the idea of having direct
 
04:25:29.790 --> 04:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
contact and influence with the
 
04:25:33.870 --> 04:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
Commissioners the main um piece that
 
04:25:37.429 --> 04:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
would be changed if we were
 
04:25:40.630 --> 04:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
not uh managing cases within an
 
04:25:40.640 --> 04:25:42.229 align:start position:0%
not uh managing cases within an
adjudicative

04:25:42.229 --> 04:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
adjudicative
 
04:25:46.429 --> 04:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
procedure I I I think that the uh per uh
 
04:25:48.109 --> 04:25:48.119 align:start position:0%
first of all thank you for that question
 
04:25:50.790 --> 04:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
and I I actually think to be candid that
 
04:25:53.710 --> 04:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
that possibility of ex parte contact is
 
04:25:57.630 --> 04:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
not my biggest worry because I have uh
 
04:25:59.630 --> 04:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
having dealt with several generations of
 
04:26:02.429 --> 04:26:02.439 align:start position:0%
pu Commissioners I have a a high degree
 
04:26:05.109 --> 04:26:05.119 align:start position:0%
of faith in their personal integrity and
 
04:26:07.389 --> 04:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
my guess is that they would avoid those
 
04:26:09.910 --> 04:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
kinds of xparte contacts what I'm more
 
04:26:13.469 --> 04:26:13.479 align:start position:0%
worried about is the Pu making decisions
 
04:26:15.109 --> 04:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
and you know we're talking about rate
 
04:26:18.189 --> 04:26:18.199 align:start position:0%
cases here right rate proceedings and so
 
04:26:20.590 --> 04:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
that has to do with you know what rates
 
04:26:23.670 --> 04:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
will eversource or Liberty or Unitil or
 
04:26:25.910 --> 04:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
any of the water companies be allowed to
 
04:26:29.070 --> 04:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
charge all of their customers and if you
 
04:26:32.870 --> 04:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
don't require the rigors of adjudication
 
04:26:35.510 --> 04:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
then the commission could basically just
 
04:26:37.750 --> 04:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
pluck numbers out of thin air and say
 
04:26:42.750 --> 04:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
well you know uh eversource asked for a
 
04:26:45.910 --> 04:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
15% R increase and the consumer Advocate
 
04:26:49.070 --> 04:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
favored a 5% rate increase and we're
 
04:26:52.070 --> 04:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
just going to decide 12% because that's
 
04:26:54.309 --> 04:26:54.319 align:start position:0%
what we like and I have no way of
 
04:26:56.870 --> 04:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
knowing how they got to that 12% whether
 
04:26:58.870 --> 04:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
there was and neither does the utility
 
04:27:00.950 --> 04:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
whether there was any rational basis for
 
04:27:02.429 --> 04:27:02.439 align:start position:0%
that kind of decision or whether they
 
04:27:06.469 --> 04:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
just guessed and you know um my favorite
 
04:27:09.149 --> 04:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
part of rate cases is what return on
 
04:27:12.189 --> 04:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
Equity is a utility entitled to meaning
 
04:27:13.950 --> 04:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
what what is the commission going to
 
04:27:15.910 --> 04:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
assume its shareholder should be able to
 
04:27:18.630 --> 04:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
earn uh as a result of its operations
 
04:27:20.269 --> 04:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and it makes a
 
04:27:23.309 --> 04:27:23.319 align:start position:0%
difference whether that return on Equity
 
04:27:25.870 --> 04:27:25.880 align:start position:0%
is assumed to be 20% that would be
 
04:27:28.710 --> 04:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
ridiculously high in the current economy
 
04:27:32.349 --> 04:27:32.359 align:start position:0%
or uh 5% which would be so low from a
 
04:27:34.790 --> 04:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
utility standpoint that it would be a
 
04:27:36.510 --> 04:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
violation of the taking Clause of the
 
04:27:38.070 --> 04:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
Fifth Amendment well if you don't
 
04:27:40.269 --> 04:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
require adjudication neither I nor the
 
04:27:42.149 --> 04:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
utilities really have any way of
 
04:27:44.710 --> 04:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
determining what the actual basis of the
 
04:27:46.469 --> 04:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
commission's decision is and it would be
 
04:27:50.309 --> 04:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
up to their whim I guess to uh figure
 
04:27:53.070 --> 04:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
out or determine how precise they would
 
04:27:55.149 --> 04:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
actually be in terms of explaining
 
04:27:57.189 --> 04:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
themselves and it would be impossible to
 
04:27:59.070 --> 04:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
appeal because I wouldn't know what to
 
04:28:00.510 --> 04:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
say to the Supreme Court about what the
 
04:28:02.950 --> 04:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
agency did wrong other than gosh I think
 
04:28:05.630 --> 04:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
they were too generous to the company so
 
04:28:07.309 --> 04:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
it's accountability as well as
 
04:28:10.109 --> 04:28:10.119 align:start position:0%
transparency absolutely not show okay
 
04:28:13.790 --> 04:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that excellent
 
04:28:16.389 --> 04:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
question uh representative man has
 
04:28:20.830 --> 04:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:23.469 --> 04:28:23.479 align:start position:0%
question don't forget to unmute yourself
 
04:28:26.189 --> 04:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I I finally remember thank you Mr
 
04:28:30.670 --> 04:28:30.680 align:start position:0%
chairman um I have um I have an example
 
04:28:34.950 --> 04:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
I would like to ask you about Mr ch um
 
04:28:37.750 --> 04:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
and that is uh assistance benefit charge
 
04:28:44.790 --> 04:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
is um can be added for benefits and um
 
04:28:47.790 --> 04:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
as I guess as determined by
 
04:28:50.229 --> 04:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
Regulators is is a statement in the
 
04:28:52.750 --> 04:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
legislation how does what you have
 
04:28:56.710 --> 04:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
talked about relate to that is that is
 
04:28:59.389 --> 04:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
that not
 
04:29:03.830 --> 04:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
um um legislation if you are choosing to
 
04:29:06.149 --> 04:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
raise the assistance benefits charge to
 
04:29:08.429 --> 04:29:08.439 align:start position:0%
pay for a certain thing that they decide
 
04:29:09.349 --> 04:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
is a
 
04:29:11.349 --> 04:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
benefit well thank you representative
 
04:29:13.670 --> 04:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
man for that for that question and I I
 
04:29:16.469 --> 04:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
guess my answer is that it's it's it's a
 
04:29:19.070 --> 04:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
difficult example to focus on because
 
04:29:21.229 --> 04:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
obviously the system benefits charge is
 
04:29:23.950 --> 04:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
itself a matter of uh I guess you would
 
04:29:27.510 --> 04:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
say controversy or discussion or uh
 
04:29:29.990 --> 04:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
re-evaluation uh to to my way of
 
04:29:33.030 --> 04:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
thinking and and this is the way the Pu
 
04:29:35.990 --> 04:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
chose to treat the subject uh a decision
 
04:29:38.189 --> 04:29:38.199 align:start position:0%
on what the system benefits charge
 
04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
should be what cents per kilowatt hour
 
04:29:42.550 --> 04:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
charge that should be for an electric
 
04:29:45.950 --> 04:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
utility is a decision pursuant to RSA
 
04:29:50.389 --> 04:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
chapter 378 about what a rate is that is
 
04:29:53.429 --> 04:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
the requisite just and reasonable rate
 
04:29:55.469 --> 04:29:55.479 align:start position:0%
so I would contend that the system
 
04:29:57.309 --> 04:29:57.319 align:start position:0%
benefits charge is like any other
 
04:29:59.309 --> 04:29:59.319 align:start position:0%
utility charge at least for purposes of
 
04:30:02.269 --> 04:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
this conversation meaning it is simply a
 
04:30:04.349 --> 04:30:04.359 align:start position:0%
just and reasonable rate as determined
 
04:30:07.269 --> 04:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
by the Pu that is imposed on customers
 
04:30:09.109 --> 04:30:09.119 align:start position:0%
in exchange for a service that they
 
04:30:11.149 --> 04:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
receive and all the discussions that
 
04:30:13.030 --> 04:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
we've been having about the SBC are
 
04:30:15.950 --> 04:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
about whether that service is really
 
04:30:19.229 --> 04:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
sufficiently valuable to justify the uh
 
04:30:21.550 --> 04:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
level of the charge and and again it's
 
04:30:24.070 --> 04:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
Authority that has been delegated to the
 
04:30:27.790 --> 04:30:27.800 align:start position:0%
Pu that the legislature can take back
 
04:30:30.030 --> 04:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
and these other conversations we've been
 
04:30:32.309 --> 04:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
having are about whether and to what
 
04:30:34.830 --> 04:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
extent the legislature should reclaim
 
04:30:37.189 --> 04:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
some of that delegation Authority I I I
 
04:30:39.630 --> 04:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
hope that was a sufficiently lucid
 
04:30:41.510 --> 04:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
answer thank you thank you
 
04:30:47.550 --> 04:30:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:52.750 --> 04:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:56.830 --> 04:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
yourself I thank you I have a very
 
04:31:02.870 --> 04:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
simplistic mind and in my mind
 
04:31:06.550 --> 04:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
if deliberations have to take
 
04:31:08.349 --> 04:31:08.359 align:start position:0%
place in
 
04:31:11.910 --> 04:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
public isn't that doesn't that make one
 
04:31:14.630 --> 04:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
more aware I I'm going to assume and
 
04:31:17.550 --> 04:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
please correct me that information from
 
04:31:19.790 --> 04:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
both sides have to be
 
04:31:24.429 --> 04:31:24.439 align:start position:0%
presented in a to be uh to both to to
 
04:31:25.950 --> 04:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners and then they have to
 
04:31:28.429 --> 04:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
deliberate it deliberate on it and come
 
04:31:31.149 --> 04:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
to a conclusion if those deliberations
 
04:31:34.229 --> 04:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
have to take place in public I would
 
04:31:36.510 --> 04:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
assume there'd be a record of them
 
04:31:38.790 --> 04:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere and again I'm making a lot of
 
04:31:41.750 --> 04:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
assumptions that sets of information
 
04:31:44.349 --> 04:31:44.359 align:start position:0%
would be available and why wouldn't that
 
04:31:45.630 --> 04:31:45.640 align:start position:0%
be more
 
04:31:50.670 --> 04:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
transparent than having deliberations in
 
04:31:52.950 --> 04:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
private thank you representative Cali
 
04:31:55.349 --> 04:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
pittz uh and let me just come out of the
 
04:31:58.349 --> 04:31:58.359 align:start position:0%
closet as a fellow simple-minded person
 
04:31:59.990 --> 04:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you for giving me permission to
 
04:32:04.070 --> 04:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
be forthright about that uh so a short
 
04:32:06.990 --> 04:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
and maybe glib answer is that back in
 
04:32:10.030 --> 04:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
2007 the general court decided that it
 
04:32:12.790 --> 04:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
would be desirable for deliberations in
 
04:32:15.550 --> 04:32:15.560 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceedings at the Pu to be
 
04:32:18.269 --> 04:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
conducted privately and I I I tried to
 
04:32:19.750 --> 04:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
explain a little bit about what I think
 
04:32:22.070 --> 04:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
the justification for that is but as a
 
04:32:24.870 --> 04:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
general principle what you just laid out
 
04:32:26.990 --> 04:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
the premise of your question is the same
 
04:32:29.870 --> 04:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
premise that underlies our right to no
 
04:32:31.710 --> 04:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
law and particularly the open meeting
 
04:32:33.870 --> 04:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
provisions of the right to no law
 
04:32:36.830 --> 04:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
overall the legislature has determined
 
04:32:39.550 --> 04:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
that we want government bodies like the
 
04:32:42.910 --> 04:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
Pu to conduct their business in public
 
04:32:45.670 --> 04:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
so that we know what the basis for their
 
04:32:49.269 --> 04:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
decisions is and what kinds of uh
 
04:32:51.070 --> 04:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
influences are being brought to bear on
 
04:32:54.910 --> 04:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
the decision makers uh the RSA 91a
 
04:32:57.149 --> 04:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
requires public bodies not just to to
 
04:33:00.149 --> 04:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
meet in public but to keep minutes and
 
04:33:02.670 --> 04:33:02.680 align:start position:0%
when the Pu does meet in public for
 
04:33:06.070 --> 04:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
public deliberations they do uh uh
 
04:33:10.230 --> 04:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
develop and approve minutes now you know
 
04:33:11.830 --> 04:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
they don't do a lot of deliberating in
 
04:33:13.390 --> 04:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
public so there aren't a lot of minutes
 
04:33:16.269 --> 04:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
to review and you could uh argue I guess
 
04:33:17.670 --> 04:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
about the extent to which the minutes
 
04:33:19.670 --> 04:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
adequately reflect the actual
 
04:33:22.269 --> 04:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
deliberations but that's how it works as
 
04:33:24.269 --> 04:33:24.279 align:start position:0%
a generic matter with respect to
 
04:33:25.990 --> 04:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
government agencies they are supposed to
 
04:33:27.750 --> 04:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
meet in public they're supposed to
 
04:33:29.551 --> 04:33:29.561 align:start position:0%
discuss things in public and they're
 
04:33:32.349 --> 04:33:32.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:35.910 --> 04:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
minutes and may I clarify
 
04:33:39.429 --> 04:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
yes follow up then then my understanding
 
04:33:42.390 --> 04:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
and again in this simple-minded view was
 
04:33:45.390 --> 04:33:45.400 align:start position:0%
that your bill does not want this to
 
04:33:49.109 --> 04:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
happen this bill wants them to be able
 
04:33:52.109 --> 04:33:52.119 align:start position:0%
to the the process to be public but
 
04:33:54.789 --> 04:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
deliberations to be private is that
 
04:33:57.230 --> 04:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
correct is that what you're
 
04:33:59.070 --> 04:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
advocating uh thank you for that
 
04:34:01.830 --> 04:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
question and that followup I I I guess I
 
04:34:03.590 --> 04:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
disagree or at least maybe I haven't
 
04:34:06.390 --> 04:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
expressed myself with sufficient clarity
 
04:34:09.189 --> 04:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh the main Public Utilities Commission
 
04:34:10.789 --> 04:34:10.799 align:start position:0%
just to cite the example that comes
 
04:34:13.349 --> 04:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
right to my mind does do all of its
 
04:34:15.551 --> 04:34:15.561 align:start position:0%
deliberations in public whether they
 
04:34:19.150 --> 04:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
have adjudicated or not and I I I think
 
04:34:21.349 --> 04:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
there's much to be said for that public
 
04:34:23.670 --> 04:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
policy that's the way Maine and the
 
04:34:26.789 --> 04:34:26.799 align:start position:0%
Maine legislature has uh constituted
 
04:34:29.750 --> 04:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
their Public Utilities Commission here
 
04:34:32.910 --> 04:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
uh for whatever reason back in 2007 and
 
04:34:34.230 --> 04:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
that actually does go back to the days
 
04:34:36.629 --> 04:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
when I was General Counsel so I could
 
04:34:40.269 --> 04:34:40.279 align:start position:0%
talk about why that happened in 2007 uh
 
04:34:41.709 --> 04:34:41.719 align:start position:0%
I have a two-word answer it would be
 
04:34:43.830 --> 04:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
Clift and Belo
 
04:34:46.990 --> 04:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
just um but in other words former
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner Belo thought this was a
 
04:34:50.269 --> 04:34:50.279 align:start position:0%
really good idea there there are
 
04:34:52.789 --> 04:34:52.799 align:start position:0%
arguments in favor of allowing
 
04:34:54.869 --> 04:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
adjudicative deliberations to be
 
04:34:57.029 --> 04:34:57.039 align:start position:0%
conducted in private and when you think
 
04:34:58.750 --> 04:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
about it it makes sense because we don't
 
04:35:01.949 --> 04:35:01.959 align:start position:0%
require judges to deliberate in public
 
04:35:06.230 --> 04:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
we are uh willing to rely on the written
 
04:35:08.910 --> 04:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
orders that they issue because they
 
04:35:11.429 --> 04:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
contain detailed findings of facts and
 
04:35:14.709 --> 04:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
conclusions of law so I it's not that
 
04:35:17.429 --> 04:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to drive the Pu into private
 
04:35:19.750 --> 04:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
deliberations I'd be perfectly happy if
 
04:35:24.349 --> 04:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
you repealed RSA 36317 C and said all of
 
04:35:26.830 --> 04:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
the pu's deliberations have to be public
 
04:35:29.429 --> 04:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
it's more that I think when the legal
 
04:35:31.830 --> 04:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
rights duties or privileges of anybody
 
04:35:35.230 --> 04:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
are at issue the Pu either has to
 
04:35:38.269 --> 04:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
promulgate a rule or conduct an
 
04:35:44.949 --> 04:35:44.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:49.109 --> 04:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you um there are no other
 
04:35:51.910 --> 04:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
people signed up to speak on this bill
 
04:35:56.590 --> 04:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
and there are sorry uh no hands raised
 
04:35:58.310 --> 04:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
so I have a raised
 
04:36:01.470 --> 04:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
hand uh representative Harrington is
 
04:36:03.629 --> 04:36:03.639 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you uh
 
04:36:06.029 --> 04:36:06.039 align:start position:0%
just to as a followup to what Mr Cree
 
04:36:09.551 --> 04:36:09.561 align:start position:0%
just said um uh there's a lot of uh back
 
04:36:11.230 --> 04:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
and forth was discussed over the years
 
04:36:12.709 --> 04:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
on whether the all the deliberation
 
04:36:15.750 --> 04:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
should be public with the Pu undergoes
 
04:36:17.709 --> 04:36:17.719 align:start position:0%
uh having been a commissioner I can tell
 
04:36:20.750 --> 04:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
you that I think there's more open
 
04:36:23.670 --> 04:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
discourse behind closed doors than there
 
04:36:25.349 --> 04:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
would be if you thought everything you
 
04:36:27.310 --> 04:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
said was going to be quoted I mean for
 
04:36:28.910 --> 04:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
example someone might play The Devil's
 
04:36:31.109 --> 04:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
Advocate make a statement that you
 
04:36:33.029 --> 04:36:33.039 align:start position:0%
really don't necessarily believe but you
 
04:36:35.189 --> 04:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
put it out there in order to stimulate
 
04:36:37.390 --> 04:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
uh discussion that could then next thing
 
04:36:40.150 --> 04:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
you know be show up on the Facebook or
 
04:36:42.629 --> 04:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
the newspaper or something like that and
 
04:36:44.750 --> 04:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing that that was the reason
 
04:36:46.750 --> 04:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
that we sort of lean towards keeping the
 
04:36:50.070 --> 04:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
deliberations private was because unlike
 
04:36:52.949 --> 04:36:52.959 align:start position:0%
most other agencies when the Pu issues
 
04:36:55.869 --> 04:36:55.879 align:start position:0%
an order it comes with pages and pages
 
04:36:58.470 --> 04:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
of justification the standard procedure
 
04:37:00.551 --> 04:37:00.561 align:start position:0%
is it gives you the the position of the
 
04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
staff the position of the let's just say
 
04:37:04.269 --> 04:37:04.279 align:start position:0%
there was a utility involved position of
 
04:37:06.510 --> 04:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
somebody who opposed the utility all
 
04:37:08.551 --> 04:37:08.561 align:start position:0%
that stuff is laid out and then the Pu
 
04:37:10.269 --> 04:37:10.279 align:start position:0%
gives their justification for why they
 
04:37:12.789 --> 04:37:12.799 align:start position:0%
ruled as they did I think there's plenty
 
04:37:15.269 --> 04:37:15.279 align:start position:0%
of information provided in these orders
 
04:37:18.189 --> 04:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
and that having to do everything in
 
04:37:20.349 --> 04:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
public would just make it kind of
 
04:37:22.070 --> 04:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
difficult to have a free and open
 
04:37:26.709 --> 04:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:28.629 --> 04:37:28.639 align:start position:0%
Commissioners okay thank you
 
04:37:31.189 --> 04:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington I see a hand
 
04:37:33.789 --> 04:37:33.799 align:start position:0%
raised by representative McGee you
 
04:37:36.029 --> 04:37:36.039 align:start position:0%
recognize for your question
 
04:37:38.150 --> 04:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and this is to
 
04:37:40.750 --> 04:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington does the bill
 
04:37:43.750 --> 04:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
actually talk about uh public and
 
04:37:46.189 --> 04:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
private I thought all it did was uh
 
04:37:49.629 --> 04:37:49.639 align:start position:0%
clarify that adjudicative proceedings
 
04:37:53.789 --> 04:37:53.799 align:start position:0%
are that's that chocolate form of of how
 
04:37:56.070 --> 04:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
how uh the Pu conducts its business I
 
04:37:57.349 --> 04:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
thought that that's what it was asking
 
04:37:59.910 --> 04:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
for I I believe you're correct I just it
 
04:38:01.709 --> 04:38:01.719 align:start position:0%
was we were commenting on the on the
 
04:38:03.109 --> 04:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
discourse thing that's why I brought it
 
04:38:05.390 --> 04:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
up but uh Mr cre you can correct if I'm
 
04:38:06.990 --> 04:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
wrong but I believe it doesn't address
 
04:38:08.349 --> 04:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
it in this particular
 
04:38:10.269 --> 04:38:10.279 align:start position:0%
Bill uh that's exactly right
 
04:38:12.590 --> 04:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington uh the reason
 
04:38:15.269 --> 04:38:15.279 align:start position:0%
this whole sort of uh uh subsidiary
 
04:38:18.269 --> 04:38:18.279 align:start position:0%
conversation has erupted I guess is that
 
04:38:21.750 --> 04:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 36317 C says the commission's
 
04:38:24.629 --> 04:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
deliberative processes in adjudicatory
 
04:38:27.429 --> 04:38:27.439 align:start position:0%
proceedings dot dot dot uh are exempt
 
04:38:28.949 --> 04:38:28.959 align:start position:0%
from public meeting notice and
 
04:38:31.789 --> 04:38:31.799 align:start position:0%
disclosure requirements so that's how we
 
04:38:34.070 --> 04:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
got there but the question of whether
 
04:38:37.510 --> 04:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
rsa3 6317 C is a good idea and
 
04:38:39.109 --> 04:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington just laid out
 
04:38:41.510 --> 04:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
a pretty convincing case for why it is
 
04:38:43.709 --> 04:38:43.719 align:start position:0%
that's not a question covered by this
 
04:38:43.719 --> 04:38:49.830 align:start position:0%
that's not a question covered by this
particular

04:38:49.830 --> 04:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:52.830 --> 04:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
Bill okay uh well looks like we have
 
04:38:54.949 --> 04:38:54.959 align:start position:0%
another question um representative
 
04:38:58.470 --> 04:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
oxenham is uh recognized for a question
 
04:39:00.310 --> 04:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I was just uh
 
04:39:02.750 --> 04:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
perusing the at1d list to see if there
 
04:39:04.949 --> 04:39:04.959 align:start position:0%
was a representative from clean energy
 
04:39:07.949 --> 04:39:07.959 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because I believe they put
 
04:39:10.189 --> 04:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
out a statement that they're opposed to
 
04:39:11.869 --> 04:39:11.879 align:start position:0%
this bill and I would have I would have
 
04:39:14.910 --> 04:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
liked to have heard their reasons
 
04:39:14.920 --> 04:39:16.990 align:start position:0%
liked to have heard their reasons
why

04:39:16.990 --> 04:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:39:20.070 --> 04:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
um can can you can you tell me whether
 
04:39:24.269 --> 04:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
there's a cost to this change is is it
 
04:39:26.269 --> 04:39:26.279 align:start position:0%
the case that if there everything is
 
04:39:29.150 --> 04:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
going to be a contested case that this
 
04:39:32.750 --> 04:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
is going to be imposing additional costs
 
04:39:32.760 --> 04:39:33.830 align:start position:0%
is going to be imposing additional costs
on

04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:39:33.840 --> 04:39:36.230 align:start position:0%
on
participants

04:39:36.230 --> 04:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
participants
 
04:39:39.390 --> 04:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
uh before you answer Mr gree I just want
 
04:39:42.030 --> 04:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
to point out to representative oxam that
 
04:39:44.230 --> 04:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
meline manow from clean energy New
 
04:39:47.310 --> 04:39:47.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire did sign up uh in support of
 
04:39:51.190 --> 04:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
this bill according to the sheet I have
 
04:39:52.910 --> 04:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead Mr C and answer the question
 
04:39:54.590 --> 04:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you well first thank you chairman
 
04:39:56.190 --> 04:39:56.200 align:start position:0%
V because that's my understanding of
 
04:39:58.350 --> 04:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
clean energy New Hampshire's position as
 
04:40:00.150 --> 04:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
well and thank you for your question
 
04:40:04.590 --> 04:40:04.600 align:start position:0%
representative oxum uh I I don't think
 
04:40:07.628 --> 04:40:07.638 align:start position:0%
that that adopting this bill will
 
04:40:10.390 --> 04:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
increase the cost of either having the
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
Pu or appearing before the Pu and here's
 
04:40:16.708 --> 04:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
why as I said twice and as I will now
 
04:40:18.990 --> 04:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
say for a third time this bill in my
 
04:40:22.590 --> 04:40:22.600 align:start position:0%
opinion clarifies existing law so we
 
04:40:25.550 --> 04:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
will simply tell the Pu that it has to
 
04:40:28.510 --> 04:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
continue doing or making rate decisions
 
04:40:30.590 --> 04:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
the same way it has since the commission
 
04:40:33.350 --> 04:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
was formed in 1911 or whenever it was
 
04:40:35.230 --> 04:40:35.240 align:start position:0%
back then uh
 
04:40:36.948 --> 04:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that that from the
 
04:40:39.110 --> 04:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
standpoint of parties that litigated the
 
04:40:41.830 --> 04:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
Pu and you know maybe some of the
 
04:40:44.830 --> 04:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
private interests that have pu matters
 
04:40:46.750 --> 04:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
could comment on this but it's my
 
04:40:50.190 --> 04:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
impression that what drives up company
 
04:40:53.110 --> 04:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
costs of the cost of Regulation is
 
04:40:55.470 --> 04:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
uncertainty right to the extent that we
 
04:40:58.270 --> 04:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
can make the puc's decision-making
 
04:41:00.788 --> 04:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
process and therefore the decisions more
 
04:41:03.110 --> 04:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
predictable uh investor own companies
 
04:41:04.910 --> 04:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
like that better because they can plan
 
04:41:09.350 --> 04:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:13.110 --> 04:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
certain thank you okay thank you
 
04:41:17.390 --> 04:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
um uh Mr CH and seeing no further
 
04:41:19.510 --> 04:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
questions and having no further speakers
 
04:41:23.750 --> 04:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
signed up for this bill I think we can
 
04:41:26.868 --> 04:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on HB 371 we
 
04:41:30.868 --> 04:41:30.878 align:start position:0%
had 25 people uh sign in to support the
 
04:41:34.070 --> 04:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
bill and seven people signed in to
 
04:41:36.190 --> 04:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
oppose it
 
04:41:39.310 --> 04:41:39.320 align:start position:0%
we had for elected officials we had
 
04:41:42.030 --> 04:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
representative Elaine Thomas signing in
 
04:41:45.470 --> 04:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
in support and a representative laa
 
04:41:48.910 --> 04:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
maputi signing in in support of the bill
 
04:41:52.750 --> 04:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
as well so with that we will close the
 
04:41:57.470 --> 04:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB
 
04:42:01.788 --> 04:42:01.798 align:start position:0%
371 and since we have uh some time I'm
 
04:42:06.110 --> 04:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
going to turn uh
 
04:42:08.470 --> 04:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
running of the committee over to uh
 
04:42:11.708 --> 04:42:11.718 align:start position:0%
chairman Vice chairman Thomas for uh an
 
04:42:11.718 --> 04:42:14.070 align:start position:0%
chairman Vice chairman Thomas for uh an
executive

04:42:14.070 --> 04:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
executive
 
04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
session thank you Mr chair um I declare
 
04:42:21.948 --> 04:42:21.958 align:start position:0%
uh executive session session open for
 
04:42:23.708 --> 04:42:23.718 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:42:27.310 --> 04:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
614 and with that I'm looking for a
 
04:42:29.830 --> 04:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
motion from representative Harington
 
04:42:31.270 --> 04:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
involving the
 
04:42:34.030 --> 04:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
amendment excuse me m Mr chairman can
 
04:42:36.470 --> 04:42:36.480 align:start position:0%

04:42:41.350 --> 04:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
please go ahead um I am a little bit
 
04:42:45.110 --> 04:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
confused again not again but I'm a
 
04:42:47.868 --> 04:42:47.878 align:start position:0%
little bit confused about exactly who is
 
04:42:50.270 --> 04:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
authorized to vote in this executive
 
04:42:53.350 --> 04:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
session I see a number of new people who
 
04:42:57.390 --> 04:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
are uh logged into this session uh I
 
04:43:01.070 --> 04:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
don't know who is a substitute for who
 
04:43:02.670 --> 04:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
and I would like that to ask the
 
04:43:06.230 --> 04:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
chairman to clarify for us who is a
 
04:43:08.230 --> 04:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
voting member in this executive session
 
04:43:13.110 --> 04:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
and also what the rules are for uh sub
 
04:43:15.230 --> 04:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
substitution well I can answer that if
 
04:43:18.110 --> 04:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
you want um first of all earlier this
 
04:43:19.788 --> 04:43:19.798 align:start position:0%
morning it was announced that
 
04:43:23.390 --> 04:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative Ling was a uh substitute
 
04:43:25.750 --> 04:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
for representative um white who wasn't
 
04:43:30.190 --> 04:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
able to be here today and um as you know
 
04:43:33.070 --> 04:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative hola has been assigned
 
04:43:35.750 --> 04:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
to this committee since uh day one and
 
04:43:38.788 --> 04:43:38.798 align:start position:0%
is still assigned to this committee so
 
04:43:41.910 --> 04:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
we have a full committee here of the
 
04:43:44.270 --> 04:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
only subtitute we have is representative
 
04:43:46.510 --> 04:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
Ling who was uh duly appointed as a
 
04:43:49.470 --> 04:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
substitute for today the rule involving
 
04:43:52.590 --> 04:43:52.600 align:start position:0%
that was if the chair is notified uh or
 
04:43:55.310 --> 04:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
if the chair notifies the day
 
04:43:59.190 --> 04:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
before in a meeting or executive session
 
04:44:02.150 --> 04:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
to the house um of the absence of the
 
04:44:04.868 --> 04:44:04.878 align:start position:0%
member for the entire day then a suit
 
04:44:07.590 --> 04:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
can be appointed which was in fact the
 
04:44:11.788 --> 04:44:11.798 align:start position:0%
case so with that I have to contradict
 
04:44:14.670 --> 04:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
that my understanding is that one needs
 
04:44:17.590 --> 04:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
to be appointed an hour before not 24
 
04:44:20.190 --> 04:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
hours before is that
 
04:44:22.788 --> 04:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
correct I don't believe it is but even
 
04:44:25.788 --> 04:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
if it were he was appointed you know
 
04:44:28.670 --> 04:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday I mean as result of we
 
04:44:30.390 --> 04:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
understand I understand that but what
 
04:44:32.590 --> 04:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
what is the actual rule here when does a
 
04:44:34.670 --> 04:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
person by what time does a person have
 
04:44:37.830 --> 04:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
to be replaced an hour before the
 
04:44:41.110 --> 04:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
hearing or 24 hours before
 
04:44:44.868 --> 04:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
hearing I believe the leadership uh has
 
04:44:48.150 --> 04:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
specified that a committee needs to
 
04:44:48.160 --> 04:44:49.350 align:start position:0%
specified that a committee needs to
notify

04:44:49.350 --> 04:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
notify
 
04:44:52.550 --> 04:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
leadership 24 hours in
 
04:44:55.550 --> 04:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
advance that a replacement is needed on
 
04:44:59.350 --> 04:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
a given day and Leadership will then
 
04:45:04.350 --> 04:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
affect an appointment to uh replace the
 
04:45:08.350 --> 04:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
member who cannot be there um I don't
 
04:45:12.390 --> 04:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
know if there's an exact hour listed in
 
04:45:14.708 --> 04:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
the rule I don't believe that there is
 
04:45:16.510 --> 04:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
the only thing I think the rule deals
 
04:45:19.910 --> 04:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
with is notification of leadership uh 24
 
04:45:22.110 --> 04:45:22.120 align:start position:0%
hours in advance in order to get a
 
04:45:24.470 --> 04:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
replacement in other words I don't think
 
04:45:26.390 --> 04:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
leadership would accept it if you called
 
04:45:28.510 --> 04:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
up an hour before you wanted to do an
 
04:45:30.150 --> 04:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
exec session and said hey I need a
 
04:45:33.070 --> 04:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
replacement that wouldn't be
 
04:45:36.390 --> 04:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
acceptable okay and uh then Mr chair
 
04:45:40.868 --> 04:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
chairman another followup to that um the
 
04:45:43.708 --> 04:45:43.718 align:start position:0%
uh uh we had a replacement for
 
04:45:45.750 --> 04:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative Platt when he was no
 
04:45:49.030 --> 04:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
longer able to not able to attend he's
 
04:45:52.230 --> 04:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
now attending so whoever replaced him
 
04:45:54.310 --> 04:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
would not be part of this committee at
 
04:45:57.270 --> 04:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
this point right no that's not correct
 
04:46:00.270 --> 04:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative plat is attending as
 
04:46:03.350 --> 04:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
um any representative can attend any
 
04:46:05.788 --> 04:46:05.798 align:start position:0%
committee meeting uh he's not a voting
 
04:46:08.830 --> 04:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
member uh the leadership has submitted a
 
04:46:11.070 --> 04:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
letter reinstating him as a voting
 
04:46:13.430 --> 04:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
member as of February 15 which is next
 
04:46:16.910 --> 04:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
Monday so he's here to observe I'm
 
04:46:21.030 --> 04:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
allowing him to participate because
 
04:46:23.750 --> 04:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
um we want to keep his spirits up you
 
04:46:25.868 --> 04:46:25.878 align:start position:0%
know Abol understand we want to keep him
 
04:46:28.510 --> 04:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
involved absolutely I I was just
 
04:46:30.310 --> 04:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
confused that I thought he was going to
 
04:46:33.110 --> 04:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
be a voting member this time too he will
 
04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
not be voting with us
 
04:46:38.310 --> 04:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
and one final clarification from you Mr
 
04:46:40.750 --> 04:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
chairman this is not on this topic but a
 
04:46:44.030 --> 04:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
different topic um I think uh represent
 
04:46:47.948 --> 04:46:47.958 align:start position:0%
McGee asked previously uh that as a
 
04:46:50.830 --> 04:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor she she wanted to ask a
 
04:46:53.470 --> 04:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
question and I remember you distinctly
 
04:46:55.670 --> 04:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
saying in the beginning of our sessions
 
04:46:58.990 --> 04:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
that uh a co-sponsor could in fact ask
 
04:47:01.390 --> 04:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
questions if there is time available is
 
04:47:03.910 --> 04:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
that your position at this point was no
 
04:47:07.548 --> 04:47:07.558 align:start position:0%
time yes time permitting yes okay thank
 
04:47:07.558 --> 04:47:08.628 align:start position:0%

04:47:11.990 --> 04:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
very okay with that said uh again I'm
 
04:47:13.670 --> 04:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
looking for a motion from representative
 
04:47:16.910 --> 04:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
Harrington uh on the amendment 614 and
 
04:47:23.948 --> 04:47:23.958 align:start position:0%

circulated uh my understanding is that
 
04:47:47.030 --> 04:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:49.510 --> 04:47:49.520 align:start position:0%

Amendment
 
04:48:05.990 --> 04:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
that was
 
04:48:09.830 --> 04:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
circulated um on
 
04:48:12.990 --> 04:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
Thursday uh
 
04:48:16.190 --> 04:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
February what was last Thursday anyway
 
04:48:18.788 --> 04:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
it was it was circulated last
 
04:48:21.510 --> 04:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
Thursday um that would have been
 
04:48:24.590 --> 04:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
February 4th it was sent to all the
 
04:48:27.548 --> 04:48:27.558 align:start position:0%
committee members on February 4th and to
 
04:48:29.750 --> 04:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
house committee services for
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
distribution to members of the
 
04:48:33.000 --> 04:48:39.230 align:start position:0%
distribution to members of the
committee

04:48:39.230 --> 04:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:41.310 --> 04:48:41.320 align:start position:0%
has anyone seen it because I haven't
 
04:48:41.320 --> 04:48:50.150 align:start position:0%
has anyone seen it because I haven't
seen

04:48:50.150 --> 04:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:53.270 --> 04:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
it uh Mr chair the motion has been made
 
04:48:54.470 --> 04:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for a second from my
 
04:48:56.430 --> 04:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
representative point of
 
04:48:59.150 --> 04:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
order um point of
 
04:49:02.110 --> 04:49:02.120 align:start position:0%
order I I would I would request that if
 
04:49:04.990 --> 04:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
it would be possible to take a short
 
04:49:08.548 --> 04:49:08.558 align:start position:0%
break recess perhaps um to review the
 
04:49:10.590 --> 04:49:10.600 align:start position:0%
amendment and have a caucus that would
 
04:49:14.310 --> 04:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:17.230 --> 04:49:17.240 align:start position:0%
helpful well we did pass the amendment
 
04:49:20.750 --> 04:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh around last week is there
 
04:49:26.430 --> 04:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:30.310 --> 04:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
now um just to be clear it sounds like
 
04:49:31.708 --> 04:49:31.718 align:start position:0%
there are quite a few folks who haven't
 
04:49:34.070 --> 04:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
had a chance to review the amendment um
 
04:49:35.470 --> 04:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't make sense for us to vote
 
04:49:37.868 --> 04:49:37.878 align:start position:0%
on something that people haven't read uh
 
04:49:39.590 --> 04:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
certainly we have received hundreds of
 
04:49:41.628 --> 04:49:41.638 align:start position:0%
emails between Thursday and now I I
 
04:49:44.310 --> 04:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
believe we all get the uh emails that go
 
04:49:47.390 --> 04:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:49.670 --> 04:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
committee I believe the amendment was
 
04:49:52.270 --> 04:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
passed out with sufficient time to be
 
04:49:55.750 --> 04:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
read so um I'm going to uh respectfully
 
04:49:58.590 --> 04:49:58.600 align:start position:0%
decline that and proceed with the second
 
04:50:00.830 --> 04:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
to the amendment from representative
 
04:50:03.910 --> 04:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
nder yes I second the amend the motion
 
04:50:03.920 --> 04:50:05.788 align:start position:0%
nder yes I second the amend the motion
to

04:50:05.788 --> 04:50:05.798 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:50:12.310 --> 04:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:15.590 --> 04:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
on adopt the amendment motion has been
 
04:50:17.548 --> 04:50:17.558 align:start position:0%
seconded we're open for discussion on
 
04:50:32.830 --> 04:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:32.840 --> 04:50:36.548 align:start position:0%
 
022

04:50:36.548 --> 04:50:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:38.990 --> 04:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent H thank you I just
 
04:50:42.548 --> 04:50:42.558 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh point out that to again um
 
04:50:44.590 --> 04:50:44.600 align:start position:0%
it'll say unapproved on it but we went
 
04:50:46.788 --> 04:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
over this the last time that we talked
 
04:50:48.750 --> 04:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
about amendments so this is the actual
 
04:50:51.750 --> 04:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment it just says unapproved on it
 
04:50:54.230 --> 04:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's correct the um OLS this year has
 
04:50:55.990 --> 04:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
said that this is the official Amendment
 
04:50:57.390 --> 04:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
even though it says unapproved on it
 
04:50:58.788 --> 04:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have approved on it
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:06.110 --> 04:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
adopted M represent oam go ahead I see
 
04:51:09.590 --> 04:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
your hand up for a question thank you is
 
04:51:12.548 --> 04:51:12.558 align:start position:0%
it the case that the change
 
04:51:16.430 --> 04:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
here Builds on the previous Amendment
 
04:51:16.440 --> 04:51:18.190 align:start position:0%
here Builds on the previous Amendment
and

04:51:18.190 --> 04:51:18.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:51:21.030 --> 04:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
only gets rid of that Free Rider issue
 
04:51:22.708 --> 04:51:22.718 align:start position:0%
that we discussed at the
 
04:51:26.110 --> 04:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
hearing so if if you are exempt you
 
04:51:29.670 --> 04:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
cannot ask for money under the
 
04:51:32.030 --> 04:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
program I'll let the representative V
 
04:51:34.390 --> 04:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
address that question
 
04:51:35.868 --> 04:51:35.878 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for that question that's
 
04:51:38.310 --> 04:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
exactly what this amendment does it adds
 
04:51:42.030 --> 04:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
a new section e that uh says that if a
 
04:51:44.310 --> 04:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
town accepts its exemption from paying
 
04:51:47.190 --> 04:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
the RPS that it cannot apply for Grants
 
04:51:49.230 --> 04:51:49.240 align:start position:0%
from the renewable energy fund so it
 
04:51:52.470 --> 04:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
deals with the free riter question that
 
04:51:55.230 --> 04:51:55.240 align:start position:0%
represent representative ssuch talked
 
04:51:58.150 --> 04:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
about um when we discussed this before
 
04:52:00.990 --> 04:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
this executive session was recessed
 
04:52:02.910 --> 04:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and and other than that it's
 
04:52:05.430 --> 04:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
the same as the amendment not the same
 
04:52:07.110 --> 04:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
as the original
 
04:52:11.270 --> 04:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
Bill yes that is correct thank you
 
04:52:13.990 --> 04:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh chisan you recognize
 
04:52:16.350 --> 04:52:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:18.708 --> 04:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
question in executive session it has to
 
04:52:21.470 --> 04:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
be a question can't just be a
 
04:52:25.470 --> 04:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
statement it can be a statement too okay
 
04:52:27.830 --> 04:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah I just wanted to say I feel like
 
04:52:30.670 --> 04:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
even I appreciate um the intent of the
 
04:52:32.510 --> 04:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
amendment to eliminate the Free Rider
 
04:52:33.948 --> 04:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
situation I just know that that our
 
04:52:36.390 --> 04:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities are dealing with a lot of
 
04:52:38.310 --> 04:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
things that they have to think about and
 
04:52:40.310 --> 04:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
I think that this just adds an
 
04:52:42.190 --> 04:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessary layer of confusion and
 
04:52:44.868 --> 04:52:44.878 align:start position:0%
effort for them to participate in this
 
04:52:48.270 --> 04:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:51.708 --> 04:52:51.718 align:start position:0%
you uh seeing no other questions I'm
 
04:52:56.788 --> 04:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
going to ask the clerk to um call the
 
04:52:59.548 --> 04:52:59.558 align:start position:0%
vote um Mr
 
04:53:03.030 --> 04:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
chair it you're saying now members
 
04:53:05.788 --> 04:53:05.798 align:start position:0%
cannot discuss what's in the bill we can
 
04:53:07.548 --> 04:53:07.558 align:start position:0%
only ask questions because this isn't a
 
04:53:10.150 --> 04:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
hearing this is an executive session so
 
04:53:13.110 --> 04:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
if we have discussion points that we'd
 
04:53:15.030 --> 04:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
like to raise before people put their
 
04:53:16.868 --> 04:53:16.878 align:start position:0%
votes on the table shouldn't we be
 
04:53:19.708 --> 04:53:19.718 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that well as I explained
 
04:53:21.510 --> 04:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
to representative Christian she was
 
04:53:23.430 --> 04:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
correct you can also make a statement as
 
04:53:25.110 --> 04:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
well as a question I just got through
 
04:53:25.120 --> 04:53:26.948 align:start position:0%
well as a question I just got through
saying

04:53:26.948 --> 04:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
saying
 
04:53:30.510 --> 04:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
that so yes you can you know you can you
 
04:53:32.548 --> 04:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
if you have a discussion Point go
 
04:53:37.390 --> 04:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
ahead okay well I mean I think um what I
 
04:53:39.150 --> 04:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
had said in the last hearing I'd like to
 
04:53:42.190 --> 04:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
reiterate here which is that this
 
04:53:46.310 --> 04:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
basically guts the idea of there being a
 
04:53:49.910 --> 04:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
a benefit to the state of New Hampshire
 
04:53:52.350 --> 04:53:52.360 align:start position:0%
in having uh Energy Efficiency
 
04:53:54.788 --> 04:53:54.798 align:start position:0%
subsidized through a an S you know
 
04:53:57.110 --> 04:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
through a system benefit charge and
 
04:54:00.470 --> 04:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's what it was designed for so we're
 
04:54:03.590 --> 04:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
really undoing the ability of our towns
 
04:54:05.270 --> 04:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
to be able to invest in Energy
 
04:54:07.590 --> 04:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
Efficiency to lower their costs
 
04:54:09.788 --> 04:54:09.798 align:start position:0%
permanently which is the whole reason
 
04:54:11.628 --> 04:54:11.638 align:start position:0%
that we want to have funding for that
 
04:54:13.868 --> 04:54:13.878 align:start position:0%
and it's a very as as and as the
 
04:54:16.750 --> 04:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
testimony in the hearings showed us
 
04:54:18.270 --> 04:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
that's a really good investment that's a
 
04:54:21.750 --> 04:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
four to one you know rate of return and
 
04:54:24.948 --> 04:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
So based on the evidence and also the
 
04:54:28.350 --> 04:54:28.360 align:start position:0%
support for the bill um I mean the the
 
04:54:31.430 --> 04:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
support not the support the opposition
 
04:54:33.990 --> 04:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
to doing away with this money
 
04:54:37.788 --> 04:54:37.798 align:start position:0%
um I don't see how we can do this in a I
 
04:54:39.548 --> 04:54:39.558 align:start position:0%
don't see how we can responsibly take
 
04:54:43.788 --> 04:54:43.798 align:start position:0%
this away I don't believe um uh this
 
04:54:45.830 --> 04:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
bill covers that subject that you were
 
04:54:49.830 --> 04:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
talking about so um but your comments
 
04:54:49.840 --> 04:54:51.230 align:start position:0%
talking about so um but your comments
are

04:54:51.230 --> 04:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:54:53.110 --> 04:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
noted what what subject are you
 
04:54:54.628 --> 04:54:54.638 align:start position:0%
referring to that it doesn't
 
04:54:56.150 --> 04:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington I see you
 
04:54:59.230 --> 04:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
recognized for a uh comment yeah I just
 
04:55:00.868 --> 04:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that no one's taking
 
04:55:02.670 --> 04:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
anything away from anybody here it just
 
04:55:04.990 --> 04:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
gives the town the uh option to decide
 
04:55:06.310 --> 04:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
whether they want to get involved in the
 
04:55:09.270 --> 04:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
program or not I mean some towns uh have
 
04:55:11.030 --> 04:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
enough resources they have an energy
 
04:55:12.628 --> 04:55:12.638 align:start position:0%
committee they may even have a full-time
 
04:55:15.030 --> 04:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
professional who works on uh trying to
 
04:55:16.670 --> 04:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
cut their energy uses and save them
 
04:55:18.670 --> 04:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
money a lot of the small towns don't
 
04:55:20.270 --> 04:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
have anything like that and they just
 
04:55:22.628 --> 04:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
assume say Hey you know let us keep our
 
04:55:25.190 --> 04:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
money and uh we'll figure out and if we
 
04:55:26.788 --> 04:55:26.798 align:start position:0%
decide we want to change in a few years
 
04:55:28.510 --> 04:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
There's Nothing Stops us from saying we
 
04:55:30.310 --> 04:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
want to go back in we'll startop paying
 
04:55:32.110 --> 04:55:32.120 align:start position:0%
the extra fees and hopefully get
 
04:55:33.190 --> 04:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
something for a project but there's a
 
04:55:34.230 --> 04:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
lot of of times just aren't going to
 
04:55:35.750 --> 04:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
take advantage of it and we're giv them
 
04:55:37.350 --> 04:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
the option to say okay if you don't want
 
04:55:40.150 --> 04:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
to play you don't have to pay we did
 
04:55:42.350 --> 04:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
have a discussion than representative P
 
04:55:45.150 --> 04:55:45.160 align:start position:0%
you recognize for a
 
04:55:48.230 --> 04:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
comment let me put this down do this
 
04:55:52.430 --> 04:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman um I
 
04:55:55.750 --> 04:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
mean the fact that this thing is really
 
04:55:57.110 --> 04:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
you know just
 
04:56:03.708 --> 04:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
another uh slice in the the SBC funding
 
04:56:05.990 --> 04:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
another cut another
 
04:56:12.430 --> 04:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
bleed uh it's also it appears to be have
 
04:56:16.270 --> 04:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
an opt out provision rather than an op
 
04:56:19.708 --> 04:56:19.718 align:start position:0%
in I the the fact that as soon as this
 
04:56:22.310 --> 04:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
bill passes all the subdivisions as far
 
04:56:25.430 --> 04:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
as the way I read it no longer are going
 
04:56:29.990 --> 04:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
to be uh paying this SBC
 
04:56:33.670 --> 04:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
unless they um the majority vote of the
 
04:56:36.270 --> 04:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
governing body elects to continue
 
04:56:38.510 --> 04:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
payments am I correct in the way I'm
 
04:56:38.520 --> 04:56:39.430 align:start position:0%
payments am I correct in the way I'm
reading

04:56:39.430 --> 04:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
reading
 
04:56:42.670 --> 04:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
this uh Representative no not exactly
 
04:56:45.030 --> 04:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
this does not involve SBC that involves
 
04:56:48.548 --> 04:56:48.558 align:start position:0%
R RPS so your comments are noted
 
04:56:51.350 --> 04:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative um MC Williams you're not
 
04:56:55.670 --> 04:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:59.350 --> 04:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
comment uh thank you to the chair I I I
 
04:57:01.910 --> 04:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
just want to say on the record that this
 
04:57:04.750 --> 04:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
creates a huge discrepancy between
 
04:57:07.150 --> 04:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
halves and Have Nots for the different
 
04:57:09.390 --> 04:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
towns and municipalities here in New
 
04:57:11.070 --> 04:57:11.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think that this is
 
04:57:14.350 --> 04:57:14.360 align:start position:0%
incredibly unfair to small towns and I
 
04:57:16.190 --> 04:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
think that we're going to see the the
 
04:57:18.030 --> 04:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
horrible repercussions of this for years
 
04:57:20.030 --> 04:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
to come this is really concerning to
 
04:57:23.110 --> 04:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
take away uh funding for the RPS and to
 
04:57:25.350 --> 04:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
get rid of Energy Efficiency this is
 
04:57:27.670 --> 04:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
really short-sighted I'm very
 
04:57:29.590 --> 04:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
concerned thank you representative
 
04:57:32.190 --> 04:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
representative oxam you recognize for a
 
04:57:32.200 --> 04:57:39.590 align:start position:0%
representative oxam you recognize for a
comment

04:57:39.590 --> 04:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:43.590 --> 04:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
if I could come back I'm I must say
 
04:57:47.230 --> 04:57:47.240 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm still trying to get my mind
 
04:57:49.910 --> 04:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
wrapped around this and I I don't think
 
04:57:51.350 --> 04:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
I can
 
04:57:53.868 --> 04:57:53.878 align:start position:0%
verbalize efficiently so if someone else
 
04:57:56.030 --> 04:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
could go first and I'll come back
 
04:57:58.910 --> 04:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
in okay thank you noted I see no other
 
04:58:01.590 --> 04:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
hands raised we're moving to the vote
 
04:58:03.628 --> 04:58:03.638 align:start position:0%
please no
 
04:58:06.230 --> 04:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
where in that case I think I better I
 
04:58:08.310 --> 04:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
better verbalize my question my hand is
 
04:58:10.070 --> 04:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
raised oh sorry I just see your hand
 
04:58:11.948 --> 04:58:11.958 align:start position:0%
raised so represent s please go ahead my
 
04:58:14.750 --> 04:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
apologies thank you very much
 
04:58:17.830 --> 04:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh even though I was my name was
 
04:58:20.030 --> 04:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned I I was not involved in
 
04:58:21.868 --> 04:58:21.878 align:start position:0%
negotiating this amendment just to
 
04:58:25.910 --> 04:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
clarify this um and uh but I did make
 
04:58:29.270 --> 04:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
the comment about uh not paying and is
 
04:58:31.670 --> 04:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
is not is unfair if you're going to take
 
04:58:33.628 --> 04:58:33.638 align:start position:0%
the use of the benefit
 
04:58:37.470 --> 04:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
so actually I I am in favor of this
 
04:58:40.030 --> 04:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
amendment and I will vote for it but I
 
04:58:42.310 --> 04:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
will vote against the final bill because
 
04:58:45.150 --> 04:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
I think it's a bad effort to try to gut
 
04:58:48.750 --> 04:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
the RPS so um I just wanted to put that
 
04:58:50.708 --> 04:58:50.718 align:start position:0%
on the record and and in my personal
 
04:58:54.150 --> 04:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
opinion if the towns opt out because
 
04:58:55.708 --> 04:58:55.718 align:start position:0%
they're not going to make use of this
 
04:58:57.830 --> 04:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
benefit I have a strong feeling that
 
04:58:59.430 --> 04:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
very few of them will make use of it
 
04:59:02.030 --> 04:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
anyway so thank
 
04:59:04.910 --> 04:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative uh your
 
04:59:07.030 --> 04:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
comments are noted at this point i' like
 
04:59:09.548 --> 04:59:09.558 align:start position:0%
to recognize chairman
 
04:59:12.788 --> 04:59:12.798 align:start position:0%
Vose uh thank you Mr Vice chairman I
 
04:59:16.510 --> 04:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
would like to um open the public hearing
 
04:59:21.548 --> 04:59:21.558 align:start position:0%
on HB 309 and recess it until this
 
04:59:24.708 --> 04:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
executive session is over thank
 
04:59:27.230 --> 04:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
you representative mcke you recognize
 
04:59:28.430 --> 04:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
for a
 
04:59:31.990 --> 04:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
comment yes thank you Mr Vice chairman
 
04:59:33.750 --> 04:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I miss spoke before and
 
04:59:39.990 --> 04:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
said and translated uh SBC for RPS
 
04:59:42.708 --> 04:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
um what is not listed in the bill is
 
04:59:44.590 --> 04:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not towns would still be
 
04:59:47.350 --> 04:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
selling reck which would still have a
 
04:59:49.670 --> 04:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
free rider effect so I'm just wondering
 
04:59:52.150 --> 04:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
if the bill is still ready for prime
 
04:59:54.230 --> 04:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
time because this is a very significant
 
04:59:57.390 --> 04:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
change um depending on how many people
 
04:59:59.670 --> 04:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
adopt it based on their financial
 
05:00:02.270 --> 05:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh to get the short-term
 
05:00:04.310 --> 05:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
benefits while losing the long-term gain
 
05:00:06.750 --> 05:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
so I I just have that question I don't
 
05:00:08.390 --> 05:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
think I see anything in the language
 
05:00:12.150 --> 05:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
here that speaks to rexs and how they
 
05:00:13.948 --> 05:00:13.958 align:start position:0%
would be handled by somebody who decided
 
05:00:15.750 --> 05:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
that their subdivision wanted to be
 
05:00:18.510 --> 05:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
excluded from paying into the
 
05:00:21.270 --> 05:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
RPS I'll let the representative Vose
 
05:00:22.830 --> 05:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
answer that
 
05:00:25.470 --> 05:00:25.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh representative for
 
05:00:27.868 --> 05:00:27.878 align:start position:0%
the question this would have no effect
 
05:00:31.150 --> 05:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
on a Town's ability to sell Rex it only
 
05:00:33.270 --> 05:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
would affect a Town's ability to apply
 
05:00:37.470 --> 05:00:37.480 align:start position:0%
for a grant from the renewable energy
 
05:00:41.030 --> 05:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
fund representative uh Christian you
 
05:00:43.070 --> 05:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
recognize for a
 
05:00:46.990 --> 05:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
comment you um this time it's actually a
 
05:00:49.670 --> 05:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
question so just clarifying last time we
 
05:00:51.868 --> 05:00:51.878 align:start position:0%
spoke about this we said that the
 
05:00:55.390 --> 05:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
default would be to opt out of the
 
05:00:57.628 --> 05:00:57.638 align:start position:0%
program right for for
 
05:01:00.190 --> 05:01:00.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities um so I guess my concern
 
05:01:03.190 --> 05:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
is how will municipalities be notified
 
05:01:05.590 --> 05:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
that this is going into effect and how
 
05:01:08.270 --> 05:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
long will they have to decide whether to
 
05:01:10.750 --> 05:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
opt back in I just I'm worried about
 
05:01:14.470 --> 05:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
blindsiding um you know small towns who
 
05:01:17.510 --> 05:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
as it was stated before don't have one
 
05:01:19.470 --> 05:01:19.480 align:start position:0%
person who's who's dedicated to that
 
05:01:21.350 --> 05:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
even in Manchester I think it might be
 
05:01:23.150 --> 05:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
challenging um but just to make sure
 
05:01:25.350 --> 05:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
that the municipalities have enough time
 
05:01:27.628 --> 05:01:27.638 align:start position:0%
to really deliberate over whether they
 
05:01:30.510 --> 05:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
want to stay in and get those
 
05:01:34.150 --> 05:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
um get those benefits or popped
 
05:01:36.350 --> 05:01:36.360 align:start position:0%
out thank you for the question
 
05:01:38.750 --> 05:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative O's
 
05:01:42.868 --> 05:01:42.878 align:start position:0%
comment uh I guess my my answer to that
 
05:01:45.830 --> 05:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
question would be that towns would see
 
05:01:48.470 --> 05:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
their electric bill go down by some
 
05:01:52.350 --> 05:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
percentage um depending on how much they
 
05:01:52.360 --> 05:01:54.350 align:start position:0%
percentage um depending on how much they
used

05:01:54.350 --> 05:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
used
 
05:01:57.110 --> 05:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
and it would be up to them
 
05:01:57.120 --> 05:01:58.788 align:start position:0%
and it would be up to them
to

05:01:58.788 --> 05:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:01:58.798 --> 05:02:00.310 align:start position:0%
to
uh

05:02:00.310 --> 05:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:02:03.390 --> 05:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
determine if they need to
 
05:02:06.868 --> 05:02:06.878 align:start position:0%
a a vote of their governing body to
 
05:02:09.628 --> 05:02:09.638 align:start position:0%
re-enter the program there would be no
 
05:02:12.628 --> 05:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
notification according to the bill about
 
05:02:14.788 --> 05:02:14.798 align:start position:0%
uh to the towns and cities and towns
 
05:02:17.430 --> 05:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
about their being opted out from the
 
05:02:20.510 --> 05:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
program that's a good question can I
 
05:02:24.150 --> 05:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
follow up on that then so out just
 
05:02:26.788 --> 05:02:26.798 align:start position:0%
qualifying every municipality from
 
05:02:28.788 --> 05:02:28.798 align:start position:0%
participating in the system until they
 
05:02:30.150 --> 05:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
explicitly opt in that's really
 
05:02:31.750 --> 05:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
concerning to
 
05:02:31.760 --> 05:02:34.070 align:start position:0%
concerning to
me

05:02:34.070 --> 05:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:02:37.190 --> 05:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh representative Celly
 
05:02:40.150 --> 05:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
pitch you had your hand up yeah I just
 
05:02:44.230 --> 05:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh I just wanted to say that I
 
05:02:47.868 --> 05:02:47.878 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill will be better
 
05:02:50.788 --> 05:02:50.798 align:start position:0%
off with an amendment than without an
 
05:02:54.110 --> 05:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
amendment I think that uh the amendment
 
05:02:54.120 --> 05:02:55.430 align:start position:0%
amendment I think that uh the amendment
seeks

05:02:55.430 --> 05:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
seeks
 
05:02:59.070 --> 05:02:59.080 align:start position:0%
to adjust some differences and some
 
05:03:01.110 --> 05:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
problems with the bill not all of them
 
05:03:03.548 --> 05:03:03.558 align:start position:0%
but some of them so I think better off
 
05:03:04.430 --> 05:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
with the
 
05:03:07.230 --> 05:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you thank you I'm not
 
05:03:09.190 --> 05:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
hearing any more different information
 
05:03:11.390 --> 05:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
so I will ask representative oxenham to
 
05:03:14.070 --> 05:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
say something
 
05:03:17.948 --> 05:03:17.958 align:start position:0%
different thank you very much um I'm I'm
 
05:03:19.628 --> 05:03:19.638 align:start position:0%
I I don't believe the question of
 
05:03:21.750 --> 05:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
difference comes up in our discussions
 
05:03:23.548 --> 05:03:23.558 align:start position:0%
in an executive session we're we're
 
05:03:26.708 --> 05:03:26.718 align:start position:0%
trying to work our way through this this
 
05:03:30.190 --> 05:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
um Amendment and the fact that it towns
 
05:03:31.708 --> 05:03:31.718 align:start position:0%
my town in particular has been
 
05:03:35.670 --> 05:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
discussing for years options and is now
 
05:03:38.150 --> 05:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
coming up with a plan and is ready to go
 
05:03:39.590 --> 05:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
forward well we think they're ready to
 
05:03:42.670 --> 05:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
go forward but it's entirely possible
 
05:03:46.708 --> 05:03:46.718 align:start position:0%
that they may not put it Forward before
 
05:03:49.670 --> 05:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
such time as this is voted on and then
 
05:03:51.590 --> 05:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
all of the work even you know with
 
05:03:54.030 --> 05:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
trained professionals and Consultants
 
05:03:57.110 --> 05:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
could be down the drain because the rugs
 
05:03:58.510 --> 05:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
been pulled out from them that the
 
05:03:59.990 --> 05:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
programs they thought they were going to
 
05:04:01.948 --> 05:04:01.958 align:start position:0%
be involved in they're no longer
 
05:04:03.868 --> 05:04:03.878 align:start position:0%
qualified for because somebody in
 
05:04:06.150 --> 05:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
conquer has changed the
 
05:04:11.070 --> 05:04:11.080 align:start position:0%
rules I I I find this um not not a good
 
05:04:14.470 --> 05:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment and and not a good bill and
 
05:04:16.470 --> 05:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
and I intend to oppose it and I hope
 
05:04:19.548 --> 05:04:19.558 align:start position:0%
that others will also thank you uh
 
05:04:23.590 --> 05:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
representative McGee you have some
 
05:04:27.430 --> 05:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
comments thank you uh representative
 
05:04:30.548 --> 05:04:30.558 align:start position:0%
Thomas I want I I would like to
 
05:04:33.190 --> 05:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
reiterate something uh
 
05:04:35.868 --> 05:04:35.878 align:start position:0%
that I I'm not sure is clear here the
 
05:04:39.868 --> 05:04:39.878 align:start position:0%
change that was made was to address um
 
05:04:42.910 --> 05:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
representative som's concern that people
 
05:04:45.708 --> 05:04:45.718 align:start position:0%
would be gaining benefits from the
 
05:04:47.750 --> 05:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard program
 
05:04:50.470 --> 05:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
without actually participating in it and
 
05:04:52.230 --> 05:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
when I asked the question about whether
 
05:04:54.510 --> 05:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
towns would still be able to
 
05:04:57.430 --> 05:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
sell uh
 
05:05:02.548 --> 05:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
Rex um they basically would be making
 
05:05:04.788 --> 05:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
revenue from a policy that they're not
 
05:05:06.628 --> 05:05:06.638 align:start position:0%
paying their share to participate in so
 
05:05:13.750 --> 05:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:16.230 --> 05:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
um the I don't think this amendment
 
05:05:17.830 --> 05:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
takes us to a place where we have
 
05:05:19.230 --> 05:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
something that's basically a stable
 
05:05:21.030 --> 05:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
policy that is my concern I feel like
 
05:05:24.590 --> 05:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
it's being pushed through and it's not
 
05:05:27.750 --> 05:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's not uh a suitable solution for
 
05:05:29.070 --> 05:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that you're trying to
 
05:05:30.868 --> 05:05:30.878 align:start position:0%
achieve you're saying that you'd like
 
05:05:33.150 --> 05:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
the that you'd like towns to
 
05:05:36.910 --> 05:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
save money um by opting out of something
 
05:05:38.430 --> 05:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
that everyone pays
 
05:05:41.948 --> 05:05:41.958 align:start position:0%
into and if we do that but we allow
 
05:05:44.590 --> 05:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
towns who decide to still reap benefits
 
05:05:47.070 --> 05:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
from that program it's going to become
 
05:05:50.628 --> 05:05:50.638 align:start position:0%
very lopsided so I'm I'm asking you to
 
05:05:53.590 --> 05:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
consider uh your actions with this
 
05:05:56.590 --> 05:05:56.600 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you very much and uh again
 
05:05:58.868 --> 05:05:58.878 align:start position:0%
for your comments involving the same
 
05:06:01.270 --> 05:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
concerns I I see no other different
 
05:06:03.110 --> 05:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
concerns coming up I am moving into the

05:09:15.350 --> 05:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
614 I now uh ask for a motion from
 
05:09:15.360 --> 05:09:19.590 align:start position:0%
614 I now uh ask for a motion from
representative

05:09:19.590 --> 05:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:21.430 --> 05:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah I'm trying to get this
 
05:09:23.670 --> 05:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
thing to work again here just be here we
 
05:09:27.910 --> 05:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
go like seeing you I move that we um
 
05:09:33.110 --> 05:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
pass um the bill as amended by 2021
 
05:09:35.750 --> 05:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
022 to HB
 
05:09:39.270 --> 05:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
614 thank you representative
 
05:09:42.628 --> 05:09:42.638 align:start position:0%
n second motion has been made and
 
05:09:47.548 --> 05:09:47.558 align:start position:0%
seconded uh we are now for HB 614 uh
 
05:09:55.830 --> 05:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:58.510 --> 05:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
05:10:03.230 --> 05:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
pimel uh thank you Mr chairman um
 
05:10:05.868 --> 05:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
again I want to reiterate that that this
 
05:10:06.948 --> 05:10:06.958 align:start position:0%
is going
 
05:10:11.310 --> 05:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
to uh be to the detriment of the
 
05:10:18.868 --> 05:10:18.878 align:start position:0%
RPS and I strongly object to
 
05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
um the uh section D which basically
 
05:10:27.910 --> 05:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
makes it an opt out Bill and not an
 
05:10:32.110 --> 05:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
optin for towns opt out is not going to
 
05:10:35.430 --> 05:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
to be easy it says it has to be passed
 
05:10:37.350 --> 05:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
by the majority vote of the governing
 
05:10:41.310 --> 05:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
body well in my town the governing body
 
05:10:44.788 --> 05:10:44.798 align:start position:0%
is the entire town which means it has to
 
05:10:50.910 --> 05:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
go to the town at uh town meeting day to
 
05:10:54.110 --> 05:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:57.030 --> 05:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
this I just really object to that I
 
05:11:02.150 --> 05:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
think it it's ridiculous thank you thank
 
05:11:04.030 --> 05:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
you representative pel uh before we go
 
05:11:06.788 --> 05:11:06.798 align:start position:0%
to the next uh uh comment I just want to
 
05:11:08.750 --> 05:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
remind everybody that this is an early
 
05:11:10.948 --> 05:11:10.958 align:start position:0%
bill that needs to be tended to as soon
 
05:11:14.868 --> 05:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
as possible uh representative um Lang uh
 
05:11:17.548 --> 05:11:17.558 align:start position:0%
you have comments please I just want to
 
05:11:18.910 --> 05:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
speak to that statement about governing
 
05:11:20.548 --> 05:11:20.558 align:start position:0%
body the governing body is your select
 
05:11:23.910 --> 05:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
board or your Town Council if you have
 
05:11:26.708 --> 05:11:26.718 align:start position:0%
one the legislative body would be your
 
05:11:29.390 --> 05:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
town meeting date and vote on that kind
 
05:11:31.470 --> 05:11:31.480 align:start position:0%
of thing so just a clarification on that
 
05:11:33.548 --> 05:11:33.558 align:start position:0%
issue as Town moderator the governing
 
05:11:35.310 --> 05:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
board is always the select board or the
 
05:11:38.548 --> 05:11:38.558 align:start position:0%
city council the legislative board is
 
05:11:43.670 --> 05:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
your town uh entire town on a ballot
 
05:11:45.830 --> 05:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
vote thank you representative Lang
 
05:11:49.070 --> 05:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative samset you have a
 
05:11:52.548 --> 05:11:52.558 align:start position:0%
comment uh yes thank you Mr Mr chairman
 
05:11:57.310 --> 05:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
um um I I I've uh didn't consider at the
 
05:12:00.150 --> 05:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
time uh the previous discussion the
 
05:12:02.310 --> 05:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
impact on being able to sell directs
 
05:12:04.150 --> 05:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
that municipalities can do that
 
05:12:09.030 --> 05:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
represent McGee brought up so um that
 
05:12:12.270 --> 05:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
basically just solidifies my opposition
 
05:12:14.390 --> 05:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
against this bill the rest of New
 
05:12:18.590 --> 05:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
England states are increasing their RPS
 
05:12:21.750 --> 05:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
remember the RPS is our goal setting
 
05:12:24.190 --> 05:12:24.200 align:start position:0%
mechanism to say how much renewable
 
05:12:26.708 --> 05:12:26.718 align:start position:0%
energy we would like to have uh the
 
05:12:28.948 --> 05:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
other states around us are going up with
 
05:12:31.868 --> 05:12:31.878 align:start position:0%
their RPS and this this bill here would
 
05:12:35.190 --> 05:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
tend to would tend to depress the RPS
 
05:12:37.628 --> 05:12:37.638 align:start position:0%
and and under support it so I would
 
05:12:39.470 --> 05:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
definitely oppose this
 
05:12:42.390 --> 05:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative ssuch
 
05:12:44.670 --> 05:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
representative Pim Mel you have another
 
05:12:44.680 --> 05:12:46.868 align:start position:0%
representative Pim Mel you have another
comment

05:12:46.868 --> 05:12:46.878 align:start position:0%
comment
 
05:12:52.070 --> 05:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
sorry put my hand down thank you um
 
05:12:52.080 --> 05:12:55.310 align:start position:0%
sorry put my hand down thank you um
representative

05:12:55.310 --> 05:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:59.070 --> 05:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
oxenham yes um as as the other states in
 
05:13:02.110 --> 05:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
New England who share our regional GR
 
05:13:06.190 --> 05:13:06.200 align:start position:0%
with us have moved uh aggressively to uh
 
05:13:09.990 --> 05:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
raise their Energy Efficiency and their
 
05:13:13.270 --> 05:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
renewable energy uh many of them now
 
05:13:15.390 --> 05:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
having you know close to or more than
 
05:13:19.070 --> 05:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
20% of their total energy coming from
 
05:13:19.080 --> 05:13:20.070 align:start position:0%
20% of their total energy coming from
those

05:13:20.070 --> 05:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:13:20.080 --> 05:13:21.910 align:start position:0%
those
sources

05:13:21.910 --> 05:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
sources
 
05:13:25.190 --> 05:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
um we we've dis we we've touched on the
 
05:13:27.350 --> 05:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
past but I don't believe our new members
 
05:13:30.510 --> 05:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
are are really aware of what this means
 
05:13:33.190 --> 05:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
for regional transmission Mission costs
 
05:13:35.868 --> 05:13:35.878 align:start position:0%
this you know this small change that you
 
05:13:38.070 --> 05:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
say someone might notice on their
 
05:13:38.080 --> 05:13:39.628 align:start position:0%
say someone might notice on their
electric

05:13:39.628 --> 05:13:39.638 align:start position:0%
electric
 
05:13:44.310 --> 05:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
bill is we our our Peak demand our our
 
05:13:46.830 --> 05:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
total demand is going up as as the other
 
05:13:49.948 --> 05:13:49.958 align:start position:0%
states are is going down which means
 
05:13:53.190 --> 05:13:53.200 align:start position:0%
that the proportion of the charges for
 
05:13:55.910 --> 05:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
regional transmission that New Hampshire
 
05:13:57.510 --> 05:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
will have to
 
05:14:00.948 --> 05:14:00.958 align:start position:0%
pay could be increased by passing this
 
05:14:04.110 --> 05:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
bill by millions of
 
05:14:08.830 --> 05:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
dollars and I don't think that very
 
05:14:12.708 --> 05:14:12.718 align:start position:0%
important issue has been discussed here
 
05:14:15.830 --> 05:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
and I even though we need um rapid
 
05:14:18.990 --> 05:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
decision because of second bills I think
 
05:14:21.628 --> 05:14:21.638 align:start position:0%
we need someone from
 
05:14:25.110 --> 05:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
Dees to speak to that because that is a
 
05:14:27.390 --> 05:14:27.400 align:start position:0%
concern they have raised with us in the
 
05:14:30.350 --> 05:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
past but we have not had addressed in
 
05:14:32.670 --> 05:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
this session because we haven't been
 
05:14:36.030 --> 05:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
able to get our orientation from the
 
05:14:40.270 --> 05:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
dees that informs people about that very
 
05:14:43.190 --> 05:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
important aspect which will be
 
05:14:46.628 --> 05:14:46.638 align:start position:0%
dramatically affected by
 
05:14:48.830 --> 05:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
this thank you representative
 
05:14:50.310 --> 05:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington you recognize
 
05:14:52.470 --> 05:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
for comment yeah I have to respectfully
 
05:14:55.030 --> 05:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
disagree with the last speaker um the
 
05:14:57.030 --> 05:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
portion of the Y electric bill the
 
05:14:59.868 --> 05:14:59.878 align:start position:0%
transmission part is a pretty small
 
05:15:01.310 --> 05:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
portion now I know it's been going up
 
05:15:03.910 --> 05:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
over the past uh 10 or 15 years mostly
 
05:15:06.030 --> 05:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
because we've spent billions of dollars
 
05:15:08.470 --> 05:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
on transmission and that gets allocated
 
05:15:11.070 --> 05:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
across all of New England now the fact
 
05:15:12.948 --> 05:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
that we use more electricity in New
 
05:15:15.350 --> 05:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh is generally a good thing
 
05:15:16.830 --> 05:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
because that means our economy is
 
05:15:18.628 --> 05:15:18.638 align:start position:0%
thriving our unemployment rate even
 
05:15:20.390 --> 05:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic is much lower than
 
05:15:23.110 --> 05:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
the rest of uh the uh States in fact at
 
05:15:24.590 --> 05:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
one point Massachusetts had the highest
 
05:15:26.350 --> 05:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate in the United States
 
05:15:28.590 --> 05:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
and as was one of the lowest so the use
 
05:15:31.030 --> 05:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
of electric consumption is obviously we
 
05:15:32.830 --> 05:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to be wasting electricity but
 
05:15:34.788 --> 05:15:34.798 align:start position:0%
but just by saying we using more is a
 
05:15:36.948 --> 05:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
bad thing no tell the people that got a
 
05:15:38.548 --> 05:15:38.558 align:start position:0%
job that's such a bad thing that they
 
05:15:40.310 --> 05:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
now are working so I have to disagree
 
05:15:41.990 --> 05:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
with that and I think the amount you're
 
05:15:44.430 --> 05:15:44.440 align:start position:0%
talking about here is very very small
 
05:15:46.670 --> 05:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
amount when you're going to say uh
 
05:15:48.708 --> 05:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
spreading it out over you know millions
 
05:15:50.548 --> 05:15:50.558 align:start position:0%
of kilowatt hours how many more are you
 
05:15:52.948 --> 05:15:52.958 align:start position:0%
going to pay for because New Hampshire
 
05:15:56.788 --> 05:15:56.798 align:start position:0%
uses a fraction of a percent uh less or
 
05:15:59.030 --> 05:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
more than some other state it just isn't
 
05:16:01.110 --> 05:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
it's insignificant amount of money and
 
05:16:02.910 --> 05:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
to Town it might be a substantial
 
05:16:05.830 --> 05:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
savings especially if they use a lot of
 
05:16:08.910 --> 05:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
electricity thank you representative uh
 
05:16:11.868 --> 05:16:11.878 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing the same comments over again
 
05:16:14.590 --> 05:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
I will take one more from uh
 
05:16:17.390 --> 05:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative samich and um then we'll
 
05:16:17.400 --> 05:16:19.510 align:start position:0%
representative samich and um then we'll
move

05:16:19.510 --> 05:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
move
 
05:16:23.030 --> 05:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
on uh thank you Mr chairman uh I would
 
05:16:25.030 --> 05:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
just briefly like to contradict
 
05:16:27.270 --> 05:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
represented Harrington uh using a lot of
 
05:16:29.750 --> 05:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
electricity doesn't is not a positive
 
05:16:33.750 --> 05:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
thing using energy wisely is a positive
 
05:16:35.990 --> 05:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
thing very wise and that's where Energy
 
05:16:38.470 --> 05:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
Efficiency comes in in fact using a lot
 
05:16:42.750 --> 05:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
of electricity or energy uh as the US
 
05:16:45.190 --> 05:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
has done in the past history where they
 
05:16:46.788 --> 05:16:46.798 align:start position:0%
have been one of the most wasteful
 
05:16:49.990 --> 05:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
countries in energy does not make us a
 
05:16:52.548 --> 05:16:52.558 align:start position:0%
better Society we need to be smart and
 
05:16:55.110 --> 05:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
use that energy wisely that's where
 
05:16:57.470 --> 05:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's where this RPS comes in and
 
05:16:59.150 --> 05:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
that's where the Energy Efficiency comes
 
05:17:02.750 --> 05:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
in thanks thank you restive uh
 
05:17:05.270 --> 05:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative um rer the clerk are you

public hearing on HB
 
05:19:08.830 --> 05:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
309 and I will call on the prime sponsor
 
05:19:12.430 --> 05:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
of the legislation to uh introduce the
 
05:19:14.230 --> 05:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
bill representative Harrington you're
 
05:19:16.708 --> 05:19:16.718 align:start position:0%
recognized to introduce HB
 
05:19:19.910 --> 05:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
309 thank you mrman this
 
05:19:21.750 --> 05:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
is Mr
 
05:19:25.548 --> 05:19:25.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:27.910 --> 05:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
order who who's asking for a point of
 
05:19:32.110 --> 05:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
order Peter samich yes I just want to
 
05:19:36.110 --> 05:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
clarify uh we we have a minority and
 
05:19:39.788 --> 05:19:39.798 align:start position:0%
majority report on this yes absolutely
 
05:19:43.910 --> 05:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay so I I would suggest that uh if if
 
05:19:45.510 --> 05:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham is willing to
 
05:19:47.948 --> 05:19:47.958 align:start position:0%
write The Minority
 
05:19:51.548 --> 05:19:51.558 align:start position:0%
Report we'll do good okay thank you
 
05:19:53.350 --> 05:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
please have it to us by Thursday
 
05:19:57.310 --> 05:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon at three o'clock thank
 
05:19:59.590 --> 05:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
you okay representative Harrington
 
05:20:02.670 --> 05:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
you're on uh yeah uh this bill is a
 
05:20:04.030 --> 05:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward it's fairly
 
05:20:06.390 --> 05:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
simple it actually came up last year it
 
05:20:08.510 --> 05:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
was from the governor's whatever they're
 
05:20:10.350 --> 05:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
calling themselves now strategic
 
05:20:13.430 --> 05:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
something or other office there um and
 
05:20:15.110 --> 05:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
it was just to correct what was really a
 
05:20:17.230 --> 05:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
mistake in the uh in the law I think
 
05:20:18.868 --> 05:20:18.878 align:start position:0%
this might have been a compromise back a
 
05:20:22.510 --> 05:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
long time ago but the capacity factor to
 
05:20:24.070 --> 05:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
that should be used for estimating
 
05:20:26.230 --> 05:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
purposes according to ISO New England is
 
05:20:26.240 --> 05:20:27.070 align:start position:0%
purposes according to ISO New England is
about

05:20:27.070 --> 05:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:20:29.390 --> 05:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
13.5% now that can change so what we've
 
05:20:31.110 --> 05:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
done in the bill is just say use
 
05:20:33.310 --> 05:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
whatever ISO New England puts out
 
05:20:35.548 --> 05:20:35.558 align:start position:0%
instead of saying it's a blanket 20%
 
05:20:37.830 --> 05:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
Which I think to be in all honesty even
 
05:20:39.110 --> 05:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
though this isn't usually the where I'm
 
05:20:40.750 --> 05:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
coming from that would mean the
 
05:20:42.628 --> 05:20:42.638 align:start position:0%
utilities were getting credit for you
 
05:20:44.788 --> 05:20:44.798 align:start position:0%
solder that they weren't actually being
 
05:20:47.190 --> 05:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
produced and they were buying less recks
 
05:20:49.430 --> 05:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
because of that so yes will this have an
 
05:20:51.750 --> 05:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
effect on electric rates very very small
 
05:20:53.628 --> 05:20:53.638 align:start position:0%
and it would be increasing but it gives
 
05:20:55.350 --> 05:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
you a more accurate picture of what
 
05:20:57.230 --> 05:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
actually is being produced and we should
 
05:20:59.390 --> 05:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
be using the best information we have
 
05:21:02.470 --> 05:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
not a over-generous guess
 
05:21:02.480 --> 05:21:04.708 align:start position:0%
not a over-generous guess
pretty

05:21:04.708 --> 05:21:04.718 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
05:21:06.670 --> 05:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
straightforward thank you representative
 
05:21:08.270 --> 05:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
Harrington any questions for
 
05:21:08.280 --> 05:21:12.750 align:start position:0%
Harrington any questions for
representative

05:21:12.750 --> 05:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:16.628 --> 05:21:16.638 align:start position:0%
Herrington seeing none I will call on
 
05:21:19.190 --> 05:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
the next speaker for the bill which
 
05:21:22.270 --> 05:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
would be Joseph kwasnik a member of the
 
05:21:25.110 --> 05:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
public representing
 
05:21:25.120 --> 05:21:28.270 align:start position:0%
public representing
himself

05:21:28.270 --> 05:21:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:31.350 --> 05:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
so Mr kwasnik yes than thank you Mr
 
05:21:33.510 --> 05:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
chairman can you hear me yes we can hear
 
05:21:36.670 --> 05:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
you be be sure to speak uh speak up
 
05:21:38.510 --> 05:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
clearly thank you okay hopefully this
 
05:21:39.788 --> 05:21:39.798 align:start position:0%
headset will make the difference from
 
05:21:43.430 --> 05:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
this morning um yes yes great I am
 
05:21:45.110 --> 05:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
submitting both written testimony and
 
05:21:48.070 --> 05:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
oral testimony in support of House Bill
 
05:21:50.788 --> 05:21:50.798 align:start position:0%
309 and the reason for doing that is to
 
05:21:52.788 --> 05:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
um Echo what representative Harrington
 
05:21:54.590 --> 05:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
is saying that this proposed legislative
 
05:21:57.750 --> 05:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
change change is warranted as the as the
 
05:21:59.788 --> 05:21:59.798 align:start position:0%
PV energy forecast referenc in the
 
05:22:01.590 --> 05:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
legislation provides a more accurate
 
05:22:03.948 --> 05:22:03.958 align:start position:0%
estimate of the capacity Factor rating
 
05:22:06.708 --> 05:22:06.718 align:start position:0%
for PV installations than the current
 
05:22:09.708 --> 05:22:09.718 align:start position:0%
20% in fact the PV energy forast results
 
05:22:11.868 --> 05:22:11.878 align:start position:0%
have resulted in a lower capacity Factor
 
05:22:15.310 --> 05:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
rating approximately 14% in recent years
 
05:22:17.150 --> 05:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
this lower capacity Factor rating will
 
05:22:19.590 --> 05:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
result in fewer class two renewable
 
05:22:22.670 --> 05:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
energy credits to be distributed to each
 
05:22:24.990 --> 05:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
electricity provider in New Hampshire
 
05:22:26.110 --> 05:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
some total of that is they'll have to
 
05:22:28.708 --> 05:22:28.718 align:start position:0%
come up with more wrecks um than they
 
05:22:30.590 --> 05:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
have in the past so that completes my
 
05:22:34.270 --> 05:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:37.110 --> 05:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity thank you any questions for
 
05:22:37.120 --> 05:22:40.230 align:start position:0%
opportunity thank you any questions for
Mr

05:22:40.230 --> 05:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:43.230 --> 05:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
kwasnik seeing none I will call on the
 
05:22:46.948 --> 05:22:46.958 align:start position:0%
next person who has signed in to testify
 
05:22:49.910 --> 05:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
and that is meline mano a lobbyist for
 
05:22:53.628 --> 05:22:53.638 align:start position:0%
clean energy New Hampshire and Miss Mano
 
05:22:55.548 --> 05:22:55.558 align:start position:0%
the floor is
 
05:22:58.670 --> 05:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
yours thank you chairman Vose uh and
 
05:22:59.948 --> 05:22:59.958 align:start position:0%
thank you members for the opportunity to
 
05:23:01.470 --> 05:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill clean energy New
 
05:23:03.548 --> 05:23:03.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire supports House Bill
 
05:23:06.548 --> 05:23:06.558 align:start position:0%
309 um as a little bit of background two
 
05:23:09.390 --> 05:23:09.400 align:start position:0%
years ago in 2019 uh there was a bill
 
05:23:11.548 --> 05:23:11.558 align:start position:0%
pass Senate Bill 72 which would have
 
05:23:13.548 --> 05:23:13.558 align:start position:0%
repealed um what we call the rec
 
05:23:15.390 --> 05:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
sweeping credit which is the credit
 
05:23:17.750 --> 05:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
given to all energy suppliers that have
 
05:23:19.670 --> 05:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
a renewable portfolio standard
 
05:23:22.190 --> 05:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
obligation for recks for which the
 
05:23:24.590 --> 05:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
owners did not register to be eligible
 
05:23:26.590 --> 05:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
to Market their own
 
05:23:29.628 --> 05:23:29.638 align:start position:0%
recks so uh Senate Bill 72 would have
 
05:23:31.470 --> 05:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
repealed that provision
 
05:23:33.948 --> 05:23:33.958 align:start position:0%
and it was vetoed by the governor um
 
05:23:36.150 --> 05:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
however in the governor's veto message
 
05:23:38.990 --> 05:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
it said um that our focus should be to
 
05:23:41.470 --> 05:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
fix the credit mechanism in the law not
 
05:23:44.948 --> 05:23:44.958 align:start position:0%
repeal it currently so uh what that
 
05:23:47.110 --> 05:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
reference is talking about is making
 
05:23:49.750 --> 05:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
that change in the capacity factor used
 
05:23:52.350 --> 05:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
to calculate the credit um as I
 
05:23:54.030 --> 05:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned also in my written testimony
 
05:23:55.670 --> 05:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission in their
 
05:23:58.910 --> 05:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
last review of the RPS also recommended
 
05:24:02.230 --> 05:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
making this change uh in the capacity
 
05:24:04.750 --> 05:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
factor used to calculate the credit to
 
05:24:06.430 --> 05:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
be clear clean energy New Hampshire
 
05:24:09.310 --> 05:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
opposes the credit entirely because we
 
05:24:11.350 --> 05:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
view renewable energy certificates as a
 
05:24:13.628 --> 05:24:13.638 align:start position:0%
commodity owned by the Renewable Energy
 
05:24:17.430 --> 05:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
System owner and uh we see this Rec
 
05:24:19.270 --> 05:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
sweeping credit as The Taking of their
 
05:24:21.708 --> 05:24:21.718 align:start position:0%
property without their knowledge or
 
05:24:24.110 --> 05:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
compensation for that
 
05:24:27.590 --> 05:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
property however um the capacity factor
 
05:24:31.590 --> 05:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
used currently um of 20% is just
 
05:24:34.788 --> 05:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
inaccurate for solar and almost the
 
05:24:38.548 --> 05:24:38.558 align:start position:0%
entirety of the credit is solar it
 
05:24:41.590 --> 05:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
actually makes up a very considerable
 
05:24:44.310 --> 05:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
amount of the total obligation for solar
 
05:24:46.750 --> 05:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates in the
 
05:24:49.910 --> 05:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
RPS um in the last year that we have
 
05:24:53.708 --> 05:24:53.718 align:start position:0%
information for the credit made up
 
05:24:59.230 --> 05:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
0.479 4% of a 0.6% obligation so it's
 
05:25:02.070 --> 05:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
it's quite a bit so using the 20%
 
05:25:04.350 --> 05:25:04.360 align:start position:0%
capacity Factor artificially inflates
 
05:25:07.070 --> 05:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
the credit and so the least we could do
 
05:25:09.788 --> 05:25:09.798 align:start position:0%
is to actually use a realistic number
 
05:25:12.910 --> 05:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
which is exactly what uh HB 309 proposes
 
05:25:15.390 --> 05:25:15.400 align:start position:0%
to do so we support making this change
 
05:25:17.350 --> 05:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
recommended in House Bill 309 and ask
 
05:25:19.390 --> 05:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
you to vote out to pass on the bill
 
05:25:19.400 --> 05:25:21.788 align:start position:0%
you to vote out to pass on the bill
thank

05:25:21.788 --> 05:25:21.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:24.270 --> 05:25:24.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you Ms Mano are there any
 
05:25:27.470 --> 05:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:31.628 --> 05:25:31.638 align:start position:0%
Mano seeing none and having no other
 
05:25:34.948 --> 05:25:34.958 align:start position:0%
people signed up to speak on this bill I
 
05:25:37.628 --> 05:25:37.638 align:start position:0%
guess we can close the public hearing on
 
05:25:41.590 --> 05:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
HB whoops representative c pittz a last
 
05:25:45.070 --> 05:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
minute hand go ahead well I I I wanted
 
05:25:47.070 --> 05:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
to ask a
 
05:25:49.868 --> 05:25:49.878 align:start position:0%
question of Representative Harrington
 
05:25:52.390 --> 05:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
and I guess I can't because he presented
 
05:25:55.430 --> 05:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
and he can't ask answer questions is
 
05:25:55.440 --> 05:25:56.390 align:start position:0%
and he can't ask answer questions is
that

05:25:56.390 --> 05:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:25:59.310 --> 05:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
correct no you can answer you can ask
 
05:26:01.910 --> 05:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
questions he can't ask questions oh I
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
can ask a question yes yes of the last
 
05:26:08.230 --> 05:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
witness no but I I wanted to
 
05:26:12.390 --> 05:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
know why you would Advocate when you
 
05:26:16.230 --> 05:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
said electric rates increasing why would
 
05:26:20.670 --> 05:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
you advocate for electric rate to
 
05:26:23.110 --> 05:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
increase can I answer that question Mr
 
05:26:26.670 --> 05:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
chairman yes okay uh uh thanks for the
 
05:26:28.310 --> 05:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
question I'm not advocating for an
 
05:26:29.590 --> 05:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
increase in electric weights what I'm
 
05:26:31.430 --> 05:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
saying is that's a result of this but
 
05:26:33.350 --> 05:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
it's result of being of using a more
 
05:26:35.868 --> 05:26:35.878 align:start position:0%
accurate number the 20% was some kind of
 
05:26:38.788 --> 05:26:38.798 align:start position:0%
a I don't know exactly how it came up I
 
05:26:41.310 --> 05:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
think it was you know is how one gets a
 
05:26:42.910 --> 05:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
camel with a horse and all that stuff it
 
05:26:46.310 --> 05:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
was a compromise that came up to uh push
 
05:26:48.150 --> 05:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
the numbers artificially low it just
 
05:26:50.190 --> 05:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
isn't accurate uh it's a simple thing is
 
05:26:52.310 --> 05:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
that 20% we shouldn't be used because
 
05:26:54.830 --> 05:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's not the right number and as the one
 
05:26:56.470 --> 05:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
of the gentlemen spoke there he said
 
05:26:59.270 --> 05:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
around 14% I I heard 13 and a half
 
05:27:01.230 --> 05:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
whatever comes out of iso in the wi that
 
05:27:03.110 --> 05:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
accurately reflects what we're getting
 
05:27:05.750 --> 05:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
the 20% was artificially high so the
 
05:27:07.548 --> 05:27:07.558 align:start position:0%
utilities will have to buy some
 
05:27:09.708 --> 05:27:09.718 align:start position:0%
additional recks based on that which
 
05:27:11.628 --> 05:27:11.638 align:start position:0%
means they'll put that into the rate so
 
05:27:13.470 --> 05:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
there'll be a slight increase but it
 
05:27:15.310 --> 05:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
just is an increase that we should have
 
05:27:17.270 --> 05:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
had to begin with because that reflects
 
05:27:18.670 --> 05:27:18.680 align:start position:0%
the reality of the
 
05:27:24.910 --> 05:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:27.510 --> 05:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
welcome are there any uh further
 
05:27:29.868 --> 05:27:29.878 align:start position:0%
questions for either Ms Mano or
 
05:27:29.878 --> 05:27:32.350 align:start position:0%
questions for either Ms Mano or
representative

05:27:32.350 --> 05:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:27:36.030 --> 05:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
Harington seeing none we will close the
 
05:27:36.040 --> 05:27:37.110 align:start position:0%
Harington seeing none we will close the
public

05:27:37.110 --> 05:27:37.120 align:start position:0%

05:27:41.070 --> 05:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 309 and I will
 
05:27:44.590 --> 05:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
report that we had 40 people who signed
 
05:27:47.310 --> 05:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
in in support of this bill we had two
 
05:27:50.390 --> 05:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
people who opposed it and one person who
 
05:27:50.400 --> 05:27:52.868 align:start position:0%
people who opposed it and one person who
was

05:27:52.868 --> 05:27:52.878 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:27:56.150 --> 05:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
neutral uh we had a few elected
 
05:27:59.470 --> 05:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
officials who signed in on this bill uh
 
05:28:04.470 --> 05:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative maputi from nashwa was
 
05:28:07.788 --> 05:28:07.798 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill uh representative
 
05:28:11.470 --> 05:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
Thomas Elaine Thomas supported the bill
 
05:28:11.480 --> 05:28:13.590 align:start position:0%
Thomas Elaine Thomas supported the bill
and

05:28:13.590 --> 05:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:28:16.470 --> 05:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
representative Paul elely opposed the
 
05:28:20.788 --> 05:28:20.798 align:start position:0%
bill so those were the um elected
 
05:28:23.270 --> 05:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
officials who signed in on that
 
05:28:27.708 --> 05:28:27.718 align:start position:0%
bill so with that bill having been uh
 
05:28:29.150 --> 05:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on that bill having
 
05:28:32.430 --> 05:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
been closed and we still have uh some
 
05:28:36.150 --> 05:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
time left before we um have to open the
 
05:28:37.788 --> 05:28:37.798 align:start position:0%
public hearing on the next bill I would
 
05:28:42.830 --> 05:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
like to open a public session on HB one
 
05:28:46.670 --> 05:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
executive session rather on HB 119 and I
 
05:28:48.990 --> 05:28:49.000 align:start position:0%

discussion

05:29:32.670 --> 05:29:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:32.680 --> 05:29:38.110 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:29:38.110 --> 05:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:41.310 --> 05:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
McGee un don't forget to unmute I just
 
05:29:44.350 --> 05:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
realized um I would like to ask why we
 
05:29:50.390 --> 05:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:52.750 --> 05:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
itl do you want to address that
 
05:29:54.628 --> 05:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
representative cambril since you made
 
05:29:57.150 --> 05:29:57.160 align:start position:0%
the motion yes thank you for the
 
05:30:00.548 --> 05:30:00.558 align:start position:0%
question uh I just see this simply as I
 
05:30:02.750 --> 05:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
do not feel that we the legislature
 
05:30:05.310 --> 05:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
should be giving away this authority to
 
05:30:08.708 --> 05:30:08.718 align:start position:0%
uh unelected bureaucrats when uh this is
 
05:30:10.548 --> 05:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
what the people of New Hampshire elected
 
05:30:13.110 --> 05:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
us to do is to be their voice so that's
 
05:30:15.750 --> 05:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
that is why I am uh I am recommending
 
05:30:18.390 --> 05:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
itl on this
 
05:30:21.310 --> 05:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
05:30:26.070 --> 05:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh oxenham I guess is next thank you
 
05:30:29.190 --> 05:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
um again I must protest going to an
 
05:30:31.708 --> 05:30:31.718 align:start position:0%
executive session on on this bill ahead
 
05:30:34.628 --> 05:30:34.638 align:start position:0%
of our ability to hear the
 
05:30:36.990 --> 05:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
orientation from the Department of
 
05:30:39.190 --> 05:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services which would
 
05:30:42.350 --> 05:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
educate our new members and many of our
 
05:30:45.190 --> 05:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
old members as to the reasons why
 
05:30:47.390 --> 05:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
certain things are done in certain ways
 
05:30:50.230 --> 05:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
and how they actually work in a
 
05:30:54.030 --> 05:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
composite to affect public policy for
 
05:30:56.190 --> 05:30:56.200 align:start position:0%
the public good in the state of New
 
05:30:59.310 --> 05:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think it's it's just wrong
 
05:31:00.670 --> 05:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
working on these bills I yes we could
 
05:31:05.310 --> 05:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
have the public hearings in advance but
 
05:31:07.670 --> 05:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
not to move to taking final
 
05:31:10.948 --> 05:31:10.958 align:start position:0%
votes for
 
05:31:14.310 --> 05:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
test thank you uh representative ssuch
 
05:31:14.320 --> 05:31:17.830 align:start position:0%
test thank you uh representative ssuch
is

05:31:17.830 --> 05:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:21.590 --> 05:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
recognized yes thank you Mr chairman um
 
05:31:26.030 --> 05:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
I think um to to the reasoning why one
 
05:31:28.990 --> 05:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
would itl this to say this should be a
 
05:31:30.750 --> 05:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
part of the legislative
 
05:31:34.750 --> 05:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
process I I think U that looks like a
 
05:31:37.150 --> 05:31:37.160 align:start position:0%
little bit too much optimism of what the
 
05:31:40.750 --> 05:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
legislature can actually do setting the
 
05:31:44.270 --> 05:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
rates for the SBC is a very complicated
 
05:31:47.110 --> 05:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
process as we heard and it's whether
 
05:31:50.030 --> 05:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
they're unelected uh officials or
 
05:31:52.110 --> 05:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
experts who know what they're doing is a
 
05:31:55.590 --> 05:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
big difference uh I suggest that none of
 
05:31:57.788 --> 05:31:57.798 align:start position:0%
us would say we know better what a
 
05:32:00.150 --> 05:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
surgeon should do with our with our
 
05:32:02.628 --> 05:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
injuries than than they do so let's get
 
05:32:04.470 --> 05:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
a committee together to say what the
 
05:32:07.150 --> 05:32:07.160 align:start position:0%
best treatment is we have experts who
 
05:32:08.990 --> 05:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
know how to do this they're doing this
 
05:32:11.430 --> 05:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
right now they've been doing it and to
 
05:32:14.070 --> 05:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
put this in the lap of the legislature
 
05:32:16.548 --> 05:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
which cannot deal with it in an timely
 
05:32:19.830 --> 05:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
manner is quite irresponsible I think
 
05:32:19.840 --> 05:32:21.230 align:start position:0%
manner is quite irresponsible I think
thank

05:32:21.230 --> 05:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:32:27.350 --> 05:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:30.670 --> 05:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
man I'll on mute thank thank you Mr
 
05:32:33.150 --> 05:32:33.160 align:start position:0%
chairman uh well I I agree with the
 
05:32:36.390 --> 05:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
preceding um objections to this bill to
 
05:32:36.400 --> 05:32:37.230 align:start position:0%
preceding um objections to this bill to
this

05:32:37.230 --> 05:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:32:41.788 --> 05:32:41.798 align:start position:0%
itl um first of all um I can't
 
05:32:44.590 --> 05:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
imagine U anyone wanting to get into the
 
05:32:47.670 --> 05:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
business of doing Energy Efficiency work
 
05:32:52.110 --> 05:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
if the legislature uh which can change
 
05:32:56.150 --> 05:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
every other year um is going to be
 
05:32:58.830 --> 05:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
deciding whether or not to uh include
 
05:33:03.270 --> 05:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency payments uh or funding
 
05:33:07.708 --> 05:33:07.718 align:start position:0%
in the um systems benefit charge and I I
 
05:33:11.750 --> 05:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
think the U the history of this bill is
 
05:33:15.868 --> 05:33:15.878 align:start position:0%
uh this whole concept of uh supervision
 
05:33:15.878 --> 05:33:17.590 align:start position:0%
uh this whole concept of uh supervision
by

05:33:17.590 --> 05:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:33:20.628 --> 05:33:20.638 align:start position:0%
the U legislature was based on a
 
05:33:20.638 --> 05:33:22.830 align:start position:0%
the U legislature was based on a
completely

05:33:22.830 --> 05:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
completely
 
05:33:28.590 --> 05:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
erroneous um and really fallacious uh
 
05:33:32.788 --> 05:33:32.798 align:start position:0%
um attrib ution to uh the Constitution
 
05:33:36.070 --> 05:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
basically the Constitution requires blah
 
05:33:39.270 --> 05:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
blah blah you know people can only the
 
05:33:41.590 --> 05:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
people or the the
 
05:33:44.350 --> 05:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
representatives or authority derived
 
05:33:48.110 --> 05:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
there from so can
 
05:33:52.150 --> 05:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
um impose something like the
 
05:33:52.160 --> 05:33:54.230 align:start position:0%
um impose something like the
SBC

05:33:54.230 --> 05:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
SBC
 
05:33:54.240 --> 05:33:55.750 align:start position:0%
SBC
um

05:33:55.750 --> 05:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:00.110 --> 05:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
the last three words uh last four words
 
05:34:01.190 --> 05:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
of that
 
05:34:05.030 --> 05:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution Clause Article 28 do
 
05:34:09.270 --> 05:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
justify completely justify the SBC being
 
05:34:13.430 --> 05:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh decided by the organization called
 
05:34:16.788 --> 05:34:16.798 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission so the
 
05:34:19.150 --> 05:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
question is what is the
 
05:34:21.868 --> 05:34:21.878 align:start position:0%
motive for this
 
05:34:26.590 --> 05:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
um this insisting that the the uh that
 
05:34:29.030 --> 05:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
the leg well never mind that um I just
 
05:34:30.910 --> 05:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to say I think the effect of this
 
05:34:34.510 --> 05:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
was just to be freeze our our ability to
 
05:34:36.788 --> 05:34:36.798 align:start position:0%
do the Energy Efficiency work we need to
 
05:34:40.230 --> 05:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
do now I've worked on uh some analysis
 
05:34:42.868 --> 05:34:42.878 align:start position:0%
about the Energy Efficiency in a sense
 
05:34:45.430 --> 05:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
we're doing such a poor job in this
 
05:34:49.030 --> 05:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
state um Massachusetts has been doing
 
05:34:52.830 --> 05:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
this work for 25 years and they've way
 
05:34:55.350 --> 05:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
ahead of us and they've got a tremendous
 
05:34:57.830 --> 05:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
amount of work done I think what people
 
05:35:00.310 --> 05:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
don't understand is that once a house is
 
05:35:03.510 --> 05:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
insulated say or improved it stays
 
05:35:05.590 --> 05:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
improved for the rest of its until it
 
05:35:09.150 --> 05:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
burns down or falls down the uh so
 
05:35:11.430 --> 05:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
there's a revenue stream not a revenue
 
05:35:13.430 --> 05:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
stream a savings
 
05:35:15.990 --> 05:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
stream it's money we don't send to the
 
05:35:16.000 --> 05:35:17.150 align:start position:0%
stream it's money we don't send to the
oil

05:35:17.150 --> 05:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
oil
 
05:35:20.830 --> 05:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
industry to buy fuel we have a savings
 
05:35:23.830 --> 05:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
stream from the first year you do an
 
05:35:25.788 --> 05:35:25.798 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency program from the
 
05:35:28.390 --> 05:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
second year from the third year and they
 
05:35:30.510 --> 05:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
just keep going
 
05:35:33.390 --> 05:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
massachusetts's first year 25 years ago
 
05:35:35.830 --> 05:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
has been producing savings stream that
 
05:35:39.270 --> 05:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
savings stream lasting 25 years what
 
05:35:42.070 --> 05:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
they did 24 years ago is a saving stream
 
05:35:45.470 --> 05:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
that's lasted 24 years and so on you all
 
05:35:48.990 --> 05:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
add up uh those numbers up to what they
 
05:35:51.350 --> 05:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
did this year give you a savings stream
 
05:35:55.390 --> 05:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
a little short one of one year um that
 
05:35:57.990 --> 05:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
that you add dolls up you got 325 you
 
05:36:00.270 --> 05:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
don't have 25 you did the
 
05:36:04.750 --> 05:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
325 in 25 years because of the
 
05:36:06.670 --> 05:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
continuation what we're doing is we're
 
05:36:08.110 --> 05:36:08.120 align:start position:0%
robbing ourselves
 
05:36:10.868 --> 05:36:10.878 align:start position:0%
blind this is absolutely
 
05:36:13.708 --> 05:36:13.718 align:start position:0%
stupid to do
 
05:36:18.270 --> 05:36:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:21.788 --> 05:36:21.798 align:start position:0%
that so representative man I I'd like to
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
register my opinion on this I think the
 
05:36:27.070 --> 05:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
question here is not does the
 
05:36:28.750 --> 05:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
legislature want to get into the
 
05:36:31.230 --> 05:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
business of setting the system benefits
 
05:36:35.070 --> 05:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
charge the question here is who is
 
05:36:41.910 --> 05:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:45.750 --> 05:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
charge is it bureaucracy or is it the
 
05:36:47.788 --> 05:36:47.798 align:start position:0%
legislature and I think some of us
 
05:36:50.350 --> 05:36:50.360 align:start position:0%
believe that it is the legislature who
 
05:36:53.670 --> 05:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
has to be held accountable to the public
 
05:36:55.750 --> 05:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
for whether or not the system benefits
 
05:36:59.788 --> 05:36:59.798 align:start position:0%
charge goes up or goes up or down the
 
05:37:01.868 --> 05:37:01.878 align:start position:0%
legislature can be convinced that a
 
05:37:03.788 --> 05:37:03.798 align:start position:0%
increase in the system benefits charge
 
05:37:05.470 --> 05:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
is legitimate and I'm sure the
 
05:37:07.948 --> 05:37:07.958 align:start position:0%
legislature will agree to that but at
 
05:37:10.390 --> 05:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
some point somebody has to be held
 
05:37:13.310 --> 05:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
accountable and we believe that many of
 
05:37:15.510 --> 05:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
us believe that it's the legislature
 
05:37:18.670 --> 05:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
that is the body that will be held
 
05:37:21.310 --> 05:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
accountable so the legislature needs to
 
05:37:23.548 --> 05:37:23.558 align:start position:0%
be have oversight over the system
 
05:37:23.558 --> 05:37:25.190 align:start position:0%
be have oversight over the system
benefice

05:37:25.190 --> 05:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
benefice
 
05:37:28.750 --> 05:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
charge okay who else has a comment here
 
05:37:30.350 --> 05:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that but the
 
05:37:32.590 --> 05:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
fact is we do have oversight we can at
 
05:37:35.788 --> 05:37:35.798 align:start position:0%
any time if we feel the systems benefits
 
05:37:38.670 --> 05:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
charge is excessive if we feel something
 
05:37:41.350 --> 05:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
is done wrong the legislature can step
 
05:37:44.990 --> 05:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
in and complain about that and set it
 
05:37:46.868 --> 05:37:46.878 align:start position:0%
come up with a bill saying you know the
 
05:37:49.708 --> 05:37:49.718 align:start position:0%
maximum will be this or anything else
 
05:37:52.990 --> 05:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
but that's prior to a problem the SBC
 
05:37:55.990 --> 05:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
has been set very accurately and very
 
05:37:58.070 --> 05:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
productively over the years and there's
 
05:38:01.390 --> 05:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
no reason no reason has been
 
05:38:04.310 --> 05:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
given for wanting to put for feeling
 
05:38:06.830 --> 05:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
that the legislature actually has to do
 
05:38:09.628 --> 05:38:09.638 align:start position:0%
anything in terms of supervising the
 
05:38:11.470 --> 05:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission in this very
 
05:38:14.628 --> 05:38:14.638 align:start position:0%
good work that they do thank you uh
 
05:38:17.430 --> 05:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative we are wasting tremendous
 
05:38:19.350 --> 05:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
amounts of money the money
 
05:38:22.910 --> 05:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
that Massachusetts has saved that I
 
05:38:26.708 --> 05:38:26.718 align:start position:0%
Illustrated we're sending that to oil
 
05:38:28.948 --> 05:38:28.958 align:start position:0%
companies the oil companies should be
 
05:38:31.310 --> 05:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
thanking us for our
 
05:38:34.430 --> 05:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
our failure to do Energy
 
05:38:37.070 --> 05:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
Efficiency thank you representative man
 
05:38:39.948 --> 05:38:39.958 align:start position:0%
representative Homa thank you chair I
 
05:38:41.390 --> 05:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
just want to comment on something that
 
05:38:43.868 --> 05:38:43.878 align:start position:0%
representative man just said saying that
 
05:38:46.190 --> 05:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
if for some reason the PC has this
 
05:38:49.070 --> 05:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
authority to set rates and the
 
05:38:51.590 --> 05:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
legislature has the oversight to that
 
05:38:53.628 --> 05:38:53.638 align:start position:0%
and if we see that there's any issues
 
05:38:55.788 --> 05:38:55.798 align:start position:0%
with that we can step in and propose a
 
05:38:59.830 --> 05:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
bill to um to change those rat then
 
05:39:02.708 --> 05:39:02.718 align:start position:0%
we're right back to square one so the
 
05:39:05.230 --> 05:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
authority ultimately lies with the
 
05:39:07.948 --> 05:39:07.958 align:start position:0%
legislation or the legislature not with
 
05:39:11.110 --> 05:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
the Pu thank
 
05:39:13.830 --> 05:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you next up is representative
 
05:39:13.840 --> 05:39:18.708 align:start position:0%
you thank you next up is representative
Cali

05:39:18.708 --> 05:39:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:22.110 --> 05:39:22.120 align:start position:0%
pittz been uh dealing
 
05:39:25.670 --> 05:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
with Energy Efficiency since my landlord
 
05:39:28.270 --> 05:39:28.280 align:start position:0%
told me at one point not my current
 
05:39:30.510 --> 05:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
landlord that the on the inside of the
 
05:39:32.868 --> 05:39:32.878 align:start position:0%
window was really
 
05:39:32.878 --> 05:39:35.350 align:start position:0%
window was really
insulation

05:39:35.350 --> 05:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
insulation
 
05:39:41.110 --> 05:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
um and we've we've come from duct tape
 
05:39:45.030 --> 05:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
and plastic to really knowing what
 
05:39:49.030 --> 05:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
insulating a home is and what it would
 
05:39:52.990 --> 05:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
save I truly believe and I and I sat I
 
05:39:56.270 --> 05:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
sat in on many discussions because I've
 
05:40:01.310 --> 05:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
been here long as Moses that we couldn't
 
05:40:04.390 --> 05:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
do it as a legislature we didn't have
 
05:40:08.110 --> 05:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
the expertise to sit down and go through
 
05:40:10.830 --> 05:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
everything that is in that's entailed in
 
05:40:13.430 --> 05:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
the SBC and how much it should be and
 
05:40:18.110 --> 05:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
what so we as a legislature seeded that
 
05:40:19.868 --> 05:40:19.878 align:start position:0%
authority to the
 
05:40:23.468 --> 05:40:23.478 align:start position:0%
Pu and at this point I think that's the
 
05:40:26.070 --> 05:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
place where it stays I don't know if
 
05:40:29.468 --> 05:40:29.478 align:start position:0%
anybody I was on electric oversight and
 
05:40:32.230 --> 05:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
all kinds of I don't know if anybody is
 
05:40:32.240 --> 05:40:33.750 align:start position:0%
all kinds of I don't know if anybody is
qualified

05:40:33.750 --> 05:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
05:40:37.590 --> 05:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
to gen those numbers and I and I I don't
 
05:40:39.430 --> 05:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
think we are and what we
 
05:40:42.468 --> 05:40:42.478 align:start position:0%
need uh I've sat here and heard
 
05:40:45.110 --> 05:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
testimony that there were 25,000 people
 
05:40:48.150 --> 05:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
on the waiting list now that's gone down
 
05:40:51.190 --> 05:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
quite a bit I do believe but still more
 
05:40:52.750 --> 05:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
is needed and
 
05:40:57.230 --> 05:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
even new homes it's needed because new
 
05:40:59.788 --> 05:40:59.798 align:start position:0%
homes are not always energy efficient
 
05:41:01.750 --> 05:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
so I would say that this is a really
 
05:41:04.350 --> 05:41:04.360 align:start position:0%
important program but it should not be
 
05:41:06.230 --> 05:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
in the hands of the legislature because
 
05:41:08.830 --> 05:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
then every two years it can change I
 
05:41:10.830 --> 05:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
think we need some consistency we need
 
05:41:13.590 --> 05:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
some stability and that's why we should
 
05:41:16.948 --> 05:41:16.958 align:start position:0%
do this and do it properly thank
 
05:41:21.868 --> 05:41:21.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:24.430 --> 05:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
chanos um I think I'm mainly just
 
05:41:26.548 --> 05:41:26.558 align:start position:0%
echoing what other people have said but
 
05:41:29.190 --> 05:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
I do believe that as wonderful as our
 
05:41:32.190 --> 05:41:32.200 align:start position:0%
400 person legislature is in terms of
 
05:41:34.270 --> 05:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
breadth of expertise um we don't have
 
05:41:37.190 --> 05:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
the depth of expertise needed to do
 
05:41:40.030 --> 05:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
something as specific as rate setting um
 
05:41:42.230 --> 05:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
there's many many places in the
 
05:41:43.788 --> 05:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
government where the legislature has
 
05:41:48.670 --> 05:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
delegated rule making authority to um to
 
05:41:51.150 --> 05:41:51.160 align:start position:0%
other other bodies um completely
 
05:41:54.868 --> 05:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
appropriately and uh yeah I will not be
 
05:41:57.868 --> 05:41:57.878 align:start position:0%
voting to itl this I feel like this is
 
05:42:01.030 --> 05:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
an appropriate ation of
 
05:42:02.910 --> 05:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility okay thank you uh
 
05:42:02.920 --> 05:42:04.788 align:start position:0%
responsibility okay thank you uh
representative

05:42:04.788 --> 05:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:42:08.750 --> 05:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
oxenham yes if I may just turn to RSA
 
05:42:12.110 --> 05:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
2119a for the moment where the policy of
 
05:42:14.590 --> 05:42:14.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is set out with regards to
 
05:42:15.830 --> 05:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh state
 
05:42:18.070 --> 05:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
agencies it shall be the policy of the
 
05:42:20.310 --> 05:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire to prioritize
 
05:42:23.468 --> 05:42:23.478 align:start position:0%
public health and Environmental Quality
 
05:42:26.590 --> 05:42:26.600 align:start position:0%
while maximizing economic benefits
 
05:42:29.110 --> 05:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
through the use of economical energy
 
05:42:32.230 --> 05:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
energ efficiency measures including but
 
05:42:34.430 --> 05:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
not limited to and then it goes through
 
05:42:37.430 --> 05:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
the laundry list of all the different
 
05:42:40.310 --> 05:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency measures that are
 
05:42:43.948 --> 05:42:43.958 align:start position:0%
available to us then going on to say and
 
05:42:45.910 --> 05:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
it shall be the policy of the state to
 
05:42:48.868 --> 05:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
encourage municipalities to incorporate
 
05:42:51.310 --> 05:42:51.320 align:start position:0%
such measures into their properties to
 
05:42:55.590 --> 05:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
the greatest extent possible what Energy
 
05:43:00.110 --> 05:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
Efficiency about is about saving money
 
05:43:03.750 --> 05:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
why anyone would want to possibly not
 
05:43:07.070 --> 05:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
save money but waste money I don't
 
05:43:09.430 --> 05:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
understand why anyone would want to send
 
05:43:11.830 --> 05:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
four billion dollars of our state's
 
05:43:14.430 --> 05:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
money out of state we don't produce any
 
05:43:17.548 --> 05:43:17.558 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels we have renewable energy
 
05:43:19.468 --> 05:43:19.478 align:start position:0%
businesses in this state we have
 
05:43:21.708 --> 05:43:21.718 align:start position:0%
renewable energy jobs and Energy
 
05:43:24.990 --> 05:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
Efficiency jobs investing in those
 
05:43:28.110 --> 05:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
measures grows our economy grows our
 
05:43:28.120 --> 05:43:29.788 align:start position:0%
measures grows our economy grows our
wealth

05:43:29.788 --> 05:43:29.798 align:start position:0%
wealth
 
05:43:32.030 --> 05:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
I cannot understand why anyone would
 
05:43:35.190 --> 05:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
support this bill it hurts our jobs it
 
05:43:37.310 --> 05:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
hurts our economy it hurts our
 
05:43:42.430 --> 05:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:47.548 --> 05:43:47.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:50.110 --> 05:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
support thank you Mr chairman I just
 
05:43:54.310 --> 05:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
want to uh comment and uh build on what
 
05:43:57.788 --> 05:43:57.798 align:start position:0%
uh representative oxman has said you
 
05:44:00.190 --> 05:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
read the statute
 
05:44:02.590 --> 05:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
uh statutory requirements about it being
 
05:44:02.600 --> 05:44:03.868 align:start position:0%
uh statutory requirements about it being
the

05:44:03.868 --> 05:44:03.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:44:07.070 --> 05:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
legislator's responsibility to set
 
05:44:10.990 --> 05:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
public policy we are capable of doing
 
05:44:13.628 --> 05:44:13.638 align:start position:0%
that and Advising that and presenting
 
05:44:16.510 --> 05:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
that position to the broader legislature
 
05:44:20.070 --> 05:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
for its approval we don't have to make
 
05:44:21.868 --> 05:44:21.878 align:start position:0%
technical decisions when we have
 
05:44:24.230 --> 05:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
technical issues we can defer those to
 
05:44:27.310 --> 05:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
technical bodies but we are the body to
 
05:44:29.708 --> 05:44:29.718 align:start position:0%
make that policy and set the policy and
 
05:44:32.670 --> 05:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
determine how much of whatever we're
 
05:44:37.350 --> 05:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
going to do needs to be done so I I I
 
05:44:40.070 --> 05:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
think this bill is totally in order and
 
05:44:45.628 --> 05:44:45.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:48.548 --> 05:44:48.558 align:start position:0%
philosophy thank you uh representative
 
05:44:52.190 --> 05:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman um to to
 
05:44:54.468 --> 05:44:54.478 align:start position:0%
that point to representative cell's
 
05:44:56.590 --> 05:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
point I think that's the Crux of the
 
05:44:59.070 --> 05:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
matter right the bill is about who who
 
05:45:01.390 --> 05:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
should have the authority to determine
 
05:45:04.548 --> 05:45:04.558 align:start position:0%
the system benefits charge and it's
 
05:45:05.868 --> 05:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
getting a little confusing because we're
 
05:45:11.030 --> 05:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
talking about iing a bill right so um
 
05:45:13.628 --> 05:45:13.638 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to say about the argument
 
05:45:16.070 --> 05:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
of whose hands it belongs in is we're
 
05:45:18.670 --> 05:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
the ones that gave rate setting to the
 
05:45:20.750 --> 05:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and now
 
05:45:22.910 --> 05:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
we're saying we should take it back from
 
05:45:25.628 --> 05:45:25.638 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission and I
 
05:45:27.510 --> 05:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
think the point that we're trying to
 
05:45:29.468 --> 05:45:29.478 align:start position:0%
make is that the
 
05:45:32.070 --> 05:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
legislature tends to be a political body
 
05:45:34.548 --> 05:45:34.558 align:start position:0%
which means that our perception of what
 
05:45:35.910 --> 05:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
should go through and what should be
 
05:45:40.548 --> 05:45:40.558 align:start position:0%
stopped changes frequently which is
 
05:45:44.150 --> 05:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
why the Pu is not a bureaucratic agency
 
05:45:46.430 --> 05:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
the Pu has a stronger Mission and
 
05:45:49.310 --> 05:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
mandate than we do to keep politics out
 
05:45:52.628 --> 05:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
of it and serve the masters of least
 
05:45:55.190 --> 05:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
cost greatest benefit you know to the
 
05:45:57.190 --> 05:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
most people they're less political than
 
05:46:00.788 --> 05:46:00.798 align:start position:0%
we are in terms of how they Implement
 
05:46:03.830 --> 05:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
their role in the rate setting process
 
05:46:06.070 --> 05:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
and do everything above board in a in
 
05:46:08.310 --> 05:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
public and adjudicative proceeding which
 
05:46:11.708 --> 05:46:11.718 align:start position:0%
is not the same as us arbitrarily taking
 
05:46:14.430 --> 05:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
a vote on yay or nay based on our
 
05:46:18.310 --> 05:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
political parties which happens a lot so
 
05:46:21.548 --> 05:46:21.558 align:start position:0%
I would I would ask that representative
 
05:46:24.310 --> 05:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
cambrell understand that we're not
 
05:46:25.830 --> 05:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
taking it out of the hands of a
 
05:46:27.590 --> 05:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic body we're really putting
 
05:46:30.230 --> 05:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
it in the hands of a Bure ratic Body by
 
05:46:34.910 --> 05:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
lling the idea uh that set forth in 119
 
05:46:36.990 --> 05:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
so I think we have different
 
05:46:39.708 --> 05:46:39.718 align:start position:0%
perspectives on that clearly but rather
 
05:46:41.948 --> 05:46:41.958 align:start position:0%
than just argue the benefits of Energy
 
05:46:44.990 --> 05:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
Efficiency we should understand that we
 
05:46:46.830 --> 05:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
gave this authority to the Public
 
05:46:49.150 --> 05:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission because that is all
 
05:46:52.350 --> 05:46:52.360 align:start position:0%
they do and we don't do this so giving
 
05:46:55.350 --> 05:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
it back to us seems to be uh setting us
 
05:46:55.360 --> 05:46:57.708 align:start position:0%
it back to us seems to be uh setting us
back

05:46:57.708 --> 05:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
back
 
05:46:57.718 --> 05:46:59.670 align:start position:0%
back
backwards

05:46:59.670 --> 05:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
backwards
 
05:47:02.788 --> 05:47:02.798 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Bry uh thank
 
05:47:04.868 --> 05:47:04.878 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I'd like to just build
 
05:47:08.628 --> 05:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
on the analogy uh that Mr ssuch uh gave
 
05:47:10.510 --> 05:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
with a patient going to the surgeon
 
05:47:12.590 --> 05:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
instead of uh performing the surgery
 
05:47:14.868 --> 05:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
themselves um when you do go to the
 
05:47:16.430 --> 05:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
surgeon the surgeon doesn't just start
 
05:47:17.990 --> 05:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
operating on you right there's there's a
 
05:47:21.670 --> 05:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
communication there's um the surgeon
 
05:47:23.670 --> 05:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
explains what's going to happen and then
 
05:47:25.548 --> 05:47:25.558 align:start position:0%
ask for your approval or permission to
 
05:47:28.750 --> 05:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
start you performing this surgery uh the
 
05:47:31.750 --> 05:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
same thing happens with the Pu the Pu is
 
05:47:33.788 --> 05:47:33.798 align:start position:0%
the professional and they will determine
 
05:47:35.548 --> 05:47:35.558 align:start position:0%
what needs to happen and will'll explain
 
05:47:37.468 --> 05:47:37.478 align:start position:0%
that and then the legislature can
 
05:47:41.270 --> 05:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
confirm uh what needs to happen thank
 
05:47:47.910 --> 05:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:50.270 --> 05:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
rep representative McGee did you have
 
05:47:52.750 --> 05:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
your hand no you put took it down okay
 
05:47:54.708 --> 05:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
thank you all right representative Cali
 
05:47:58.230 --> 05:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
pitz I I I guess I didn't understand the
 
05:47:58.240 --> 05:47:59.270 align:start position:0%
pitz I I I guess I didn't understand the
last

05:47:59.270 --> 05:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
last
 
05:48:02.708 --> 05:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
um speaker because that would seem to me
 
05:48:05.468 --> 05:48:05.478 align:start position:0%
like okay Public Utilities you do the
 
05:48:08.150 --> 05:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
work you do the adjudication you do what
 
05:48:10.670 --> 05:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to do now and then either
 
05:48:13.350 --> 05:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature will rub rub a stamp or
 
05:48:15.830 --> 05:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
negate what you're doing even though we
 
05:48:18.990 --> 05:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
don't have the evidence and the proof
 
05:48:21.590 --> 05:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
and the numbers that's what I heard can
 
05:48:27.590 --> 05:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:27.600 --> 05:48:29.150 align:start position:0%
 
wrong

05:48:29.150 --> 05:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
05:48:30.830 --> 05:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
I was just comparing it to going to a
 
05:48:32.230 --> 05:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
surgeon I mean the surgeon is not going
 
05:48:33.868 --> 05:48:33.878 align:start position:0%
to tell you every single detail of what
 
05:48:35.230 --> 05:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to do but they will
 
05:48:36.868 --> 05:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
explain the pros and cons and let you
 
05:48:38.670 --> 05:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
make the decision so I assume the Pu
 
05:48:40.548 --> 05:48:40.558 align:start position:0%
would do the
 
05:48:42.548 --> 05:48:42.558 align:start position:0%
same I would just
 
05:48:45.590 --> 05:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
say okay I'm not
 
05:48:48.868 --> 05:48:48.878 align:start position:0%

05:48:48.878 --> 05:48:50.430 align:start position:0%

05:48:57.150 --> 05:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
from I only need it when I'm active but
 
05:48:59.948 --> 05:48:59.958 align:start position:0%
if I'm sitting walking slowly I can do
 
05:48:59.958 --> 05:49:00.788 align:start position:0%
if I'm sitting walking slowly I can do
without

05:49:00.788 --> 05:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
without
 
05:49:05.590 --> 05:49:05.600 align:start position:0%

05:49:08.510 --> 05:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
received an email from Michael
 
05:49:11.430 --> 05:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald at Dees he would like to
 
05:49:14.628 --> 05:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
comment on the next bill that we're
 
05:49:17.910 --> 05:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
going to be hearing which is HB
 
05:49:21.230 --> 05:49:21.240 align:start position:0%

hearing on HB 373 promptly
 
05:49:32.030 --> 05:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
so that we can uh recognize Mr
 
05:49:34.868 --> 05:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald as I think it's a courtesy
 
05:49:37.190 --> 05:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
for us to allow him to speak on that
 
05:49:39.910 --> 05:49:39.920 align:start position:0%

the last state to actually sign on and
 
06:04:33.310 --> 06:04:33.320 align:start position:0%
we did not sign on until uh actually uh
 
06:04:37.070 --> 06:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
after the first auction had begun um and
 
06:04:39.230 --> 06:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh that was because we were unsure of
 
06:04:42.350 --> 06:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
the impact on New Hampshire and uh what
 
06:04:44.270 --> 06:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
our participation would mean we were
 
06:04:46.708 --> 06:04:46.718 align:start position:0%
able to get a report get a study and get
 
06:04:49.430 --> 06:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
information provided uh to then Governor
 
06:04:51.750 --> 06:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
Lynch to recommend that um New
 
06:04:53.030 --> 06:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's best interest would be
 
06:04:55.750 --> 06:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
served by participating um because we
 
06:04:58.150 --> 06:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
would be uh better off being in and
 
06:05:00.628 --> 06:05:00.638 align:start position:0%
receiving the the funds as has been
 
06:05:02.948 --> 06:05:02.958 align:start position:0%
expressed this committee many times so
 
06:05:04.788 --> 06:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
our participation in these Regional
 
06:05:07.070 --> 06:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
discussions although it's not directly
 
06:05:10.468 --> 06:05:10.478 align:start position:0%
required by Statute or anything is just
 
06:05:13.468 --> 06:05:13.478 align:start position:0%
uh simply to uh to better inform the
 
06:05:15.708 --> 06:05:15.718 align:start position:0%
legislature as to what the potential
 
06:05:18.230 --> 06:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
impacts would be um in the case of the
 
06:05:20.030 --> 06:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
low carbon fuel there was some news
 
06:05:24.070 --> 06:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
media uh about this last fall that uh
 
06:05:27.350 --> 06:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
seemed to imply that we had spent uh
 
06:05:28.910 --> 06:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
significant amount of funding after the
 
06:05:32.110 --> 06:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
governor had directed the state not to
 
06:05:35.030 --> 06:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
participate um that I just want to
 
06:05:40.270 --> 06:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
clarify that uh some of that that um my
 
06:05:42.750 --> 06:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
letter clarifies that that information
 
06:05:45.670 --> 06:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
the uh amount expended was expended
 
06:05:45.680 --> 06:05:46.628 align:start position:0%
the uh amount expended was expended
between

06:05:46.628 --> 06:05:46.638 align:start position:0%
between
 
06:05:51.270 --> 06:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
2012 and now and that that was all
 
06:05:53.070 --> 06:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
relative to our participation in these
 
06:05:54.910 --> 06:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
ongoing discussions to determine what
 
06:05:57.510 --> 06:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
the nature of the program was last fall
 
06:05:59.230 --> 06:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
we were not able to recommend to the
 
06:06:01.150 --> 06:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
governor that we that we should
 
06:06:03.310 --> 06:06:03.320 align:start position:0%
participate because we did not believe
 
06:06:08.708 --> 06:06:08.718 align:start position:0%
that the impacts had been uh com had
 
06:06:08.718 --> 06:06:09.510 align:start position:0%
that the impacts had been uh com had
been

06:06:09.510 --> 06:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
been
 
06:06:12.110 --> 06:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
Quantified and uh we advised the
 
06:06:14.310 --> 06:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
governor's office not to sign on to the
 
06:06:15.590 --> 06:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
06:06:18.750 --> 06:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
theou um so uh that's the role that
 
06:06:20.390 --> 06:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
we've been playing this was recognized
 
06:06:22.110 --> 06:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
in 2012 there was another bill to
 
06:06:24.948 --> 06:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
prevent us from participating in lcfs
 
06:06:27.070 --> 06:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
discussions at the time Senator Bradley
 
06:06:29.548 --> 06:06:29.558 align:start position:0%
broker to compromise that allowed us to
 
06:06:31.788 --> 06:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
participate in the discussions but not
 
06:06:34.030 --> 06:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to bring any uh any program
 
06:06:36.430 --> 06:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
forward and that's the current statute
 
06:06:39.510 --> 06:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
as it exists now is that um uh we would
 
06:06:43.390 --> 06:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
not bring any any uh any program forward
 
06:06:46.230 --> 06:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
um or or attempt to sign New Hampshire
 
06:06:49.030 --> 06:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
onto participation without the uh
 
06:06:51.310 --> 06:06:51.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate legislative Authority which
 
06:06:53.708 --> 06:06:53.718 align:start position:0%
is the way it stands currently for uh
 
06:06:56.468 --> 06:06:56.478 align:start position:0%
for Reggie so that's uh and I I would
 
06:06:59.910 --> 06:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
also just note that the expenses that
 
06:07:03.350 --> 06:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
were um uh reported as in accordance
 
06:07:06.750 --> 06:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
with the statute were expenses of Staff
 
06:07:10.270 --> 06:07:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh staff time which um those expenses
 
06:07:12.390 --> 06:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
and hours were attributed to this but
 
06:07:14.110 --> 06:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
they were not over and above or in
 
06:07:18.708 --> 06:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
addition to any any uh staff time
 
06:07:21.708 --> 06:07:21.718 align:start position:0%
um they were uh staff that were
 
06:07:23.830 --> 06:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
allocated to participate in this based
 
06:07:27.190 --> 06:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
on uh the direction of Prior governors
 
06:07:29.628 --> 06:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
uh to better understand these these
 
06:07:34.070 --> 06:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
discussions and um uh we we did
 
06:07:37.350 --> 06:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
participate U but the that those funds
 
06:07:40.110 --> 06:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
would have been allocated and and used
 
06:07:42.150 --> 06:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh in any case these were not
 
06:07:45.830 --> 06:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
expenditures over and above our
 
06:07:48.708 --> 06:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
budget thank you uh Mr Fitzgerald what
 
06:07:50.430 --> 06:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
is your time constraint what time do you
 
06:07:55.350 --> 06:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
need to leave uh I'm um 4:30 or so if if
 
06:07:58.070 --> 06:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
I if I could leave by 415 that'd be fine
 
06:07:59.788 --> 06:07:59.798 align:start position:0%
but I I'll I'll try to answer as many
 
06:08:02.830 --> 06:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
questions as I as is possible
 
06:08:06.110 --> 06:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
I okay uh representative Thomas do you
 
06:08:08.070 --> 06:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
have a question for Mr Fitzgerald yes
 
06:08:09.190 --> 06:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
 
06:08:11.750 --> 06:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald for taking my question real
 
06:08:15.868 --> 06:08:15.878 align:start position:0%
quick was your staff's
 
06:08:19.750 --> 06:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
participation in in this um for the last
 
06:08:22.350 --> 06:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
say couple three four or five years was
 
06:08:26.270 --> 06:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
it voluntary or did the governor um
 
06:08:29.030 --> 06:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
Express or insinuate that he would like
 
06:08:30.990 --> 06:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
you to attend these
 
06:08:34.628 --> 06:08:34.638 align:start position:0%
meetings uh prior Governors uh uh
 
06:08:38.590 --> 06:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
Governor Hassen uh in particular um had
 
06:08:41.590 --> 06:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh we again we we consult with the
 
06:08:43.270 --> 06:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
governor's office all the time on these
 
06:08:44.788 --> 06:08:44.798 align:start position:0%
type of activities that come up on a
 
06:08:47.350 --> 06:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
regional basis um they had expressed an
 
06:08:49.670 --> 06:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
interest and we we uh we were
 
06:08:51.910 --> 06:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
participating we continued that we had
 
06:08:53.548 --> 06:08:53.558 align:start position:0%
no specific direction from Governor
 
06:08:57.430 --> 06:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
sonunu but we were able to advise him um
 
06:08:59.190 --> 06:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
that based on the information that we
 
06:09:00.750 --> 06:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
had and our participation in the
 
06:09:04.788 --> 06:09:04.798 align:start position:0%
discussions two things one we had um uh
 
06:09:06.670 --> 06:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
been able to to represent New
 
06:09:08.670 --> 06:09:08.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's interests in the design and
 
06:09:10.948 --> 06:09:10.958 align:start position:0%
development of program but two we were
 
06:09:15.788 --> 06:09:15.798 align:start position:0%
not able to determine that um any impact
 
06:09:17.390 --> 06:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire would be either
 
06:09:19.270 --> 06:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
positive or negative the way that we had
 
06:09:22.190 --> 06:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
been in Reggie and so therefore um we
 
06:09:23.750 --> 06:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
recommended we could not recommend to
 
06:09:25.910 --> 06:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
the governor to sign on to theou signed
 
06:09:27.990 --> 06:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
by the other state and as you'll notice
 
06:09:30.390 --> 06:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
in our letter New Hampshire did not
 
06:09:31.910 --> 06:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately sign on and the governor
 
06:09:34.628 --> 06:09:34.638 align:start position:0%
ultimately determined that he would not
 
06:09:37.110 --> 06:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
participate thank
 
06:09:40.270 --> 06:09:40.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh representative oxam you
 
06:09:44.750 --> 06:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:47.510 --> 06:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald I actually didn't think I was
 
06:09:50.670 --> 06:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
next but um yes thank
 
06:09:55.628 --> 06:09:55.638 align:start position:0%
you Mr Fitzgerald does it make sense to
 
06:09:59.708 --> 06:09:59.718 align:start position:0%
you that a state which is part of a
 
06:10:03.670 --> 06:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
regional electricity grid which is part
 
06:10:07.670 --> 06:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
of a regional Capp trade
 
06:10:11.270 --> 06:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
program which has many interests in
 
06:10:14.230 --> 06:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
common with the states that surround it
 
06:10:18.670 --> 06:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
should not participate and not discuss
 
06:10:22.070 --> 06:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
issues of regional
 
06:10:24.468 --> 06:10:24.478 align:start position:0%
concern and and if that is too personal
 
06:10:28.548 --> 06:10:28.558 align:start position:0%
a question I I I apologize but I I
 
06:10:31.670 --> 06:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
honestly I cannot understand anyone
 
06:10:35.150 --> 06:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
putting forward this bill well thank
 
06:10:38.190 --> 06:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um I I think that the uh the
 
06:10:41.510 --> 06:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable answer to that is that um we
 
06:10:42.948 --> 06:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
want to be aware of what's going on
 
06:10:45.110 --> 06:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
around us I would draw some distinction
 
06:10:46.750 --> 06:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
between the electricity grid this
 
06:10:49.150 --> 06:10:49.160 align:start position:0%
program was a fuel program but there is
 
06:10:53.270 --> 06:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
a regional fuel distribution system uh s
 
06:10:56.150 --> 06:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
analogous to the electricity grid uh New
 
06:10:58.190 --> 06:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not have the opportunity
 
06:11:03.310 --> 06:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
to to impact that um Regional fuel
 
06:11:05.468 --> 06:11:05.478 align:start position:0%
distribution system overly much because
 
06:11:07.670 --> 06:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
the amount of fuel we use is relatively
 
06:11:10.590 --> 06:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
small uh again similar to the uh to the
 
06:11:12.948 --> 06:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
electricity grid but we feel that being
 
06:11:15.510 --> 06:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
at the table uh we're at least able to
 
06:11:17.150 --> 06:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
protect our state's interests and
 
06:11:20.110 --> 06:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
concerns as expressed by the governor uh
 
06:11:22.070 --> 06:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
whoever the governor may be at the time
 
06:11:26.190 --> 06:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
and that um uh we we we carry those into
 
06:11:29.310 --> 06:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
those discussions and we we hope and
 
06:11:31.628 --> 06:11:31.638 align:start position:0%
believe that uh that our opinion and and
 
06:11:34.990 --> 06:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
our Governor's concerns are heard and
 
06:11:37.628 --> 06:11:37.638 align:start position:0%
reflected in the development of the
 
06:11:40.868 --> 06:11:40.878 align:start position:0%
program thank you
 
06:11:44.150 --> 06:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
sir thank you uh representative ssuch
 
06:11:47.070 --> 06:11:47.080 align:start position:0%
you have a question for Mr
 
06:11:50.990 --> 06:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald yes thank you Mr chairman uh
 
06:11:52.788 --> 06:11:52.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr fitzgeral for taking my
 
06:11:54.990 --> 06:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
question um first of all I want to say
 
06:11:57.390 --> 06:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
that in the past I have made extensive
 
06:12:00.030 --> 06:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
use of your staff on various issues that
 
06:12:02.990 --> 06:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
I was less informed about and I always
 
06:12:05.628 --> 06:12:05.638 align:start position:0%
got very good information and very good
 
06:12:08.948 --> 06:12:08.958 align:start position:0%
solid backing for uh what they what
 
06:12:12.468 --> 06:12:12.478 align:start position:0%
theyh supported and so my question goes
 
06:12:15.750 --> 06:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
to this um in the future I mean if this
 
06:12:18.750 --> 06:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass don't you think that
 
06:12:21.430 --> 06:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
it would impact the kind of advice you
 
06:12:23.948 --> 06:12:23.958 align:start position:0%
can give this committee and others of us
 
06:12:26.430 --> 06:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
who go to you for advice if you're being
 
06:12:28.788 --> 06:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
being cut out of the
 
06:12:30.590 --> 06:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
discussions well again this is a
 
06:12:34.670 --> 06:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
regional discussion and uh uh as I said
 
06:12:36.670 --> 06:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
we would never take the step of trying
 
06:12:38.708 --> 06:12:38.718 align:start position:0%
to uh commit New Hampshire to anything
 
06:12:41.190 --> 06:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
without the legislature's involvement
 
06:12:42.708 --> 06:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
that was how Reggie came about the
 
06:12:44.310 --> 06:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
governor agreed that we should bring It
 
06:12:45.868 --> 06:12:45.878 align:start position:0%
Forward we brought it forward and the
 
06:12:50.030 --> 06:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
legislature agreed um uh our our
 
06:12:52.708 --> 06:12:52.718 align:start position:0%
participation in these discussions I I
 
06:12:55.468 --> 06:12:55.478 align:start position:0%
do believe is is of value to the to the
 
06:12:55.478 --> 06:12:56.910 align:start position:0%
do believe is is of value to the to the
legislature

06:12:56.910 --> 06:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
06:12:58.670 --> 06:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
um so that they can better understand
 
06:13:01.510 --> 06:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not they they think that um
 
06:13:03.190 --> 06:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh we should be participating in these
 
06:13:05.468 --> 06:13:05.478 align:start position:0%
things I will say since the governor's
 
06:13:06.830 --> 06:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
announcement we have not been
 
06:13:09.430 --> 06:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
participating in TCI discussions except
 
06:13:13.708 --> 06:13:13.718 align:start position:0%
to a very limited extent um because uh
 
06:13:15.628 --> 06:13:15.638 align:start position:0%
uh the governor uh determined that we
 
06:13:18.788 --> 06:13:18.798 align:start position:0%
would not be part of that PCT um but if
 
06:13:21.070 --> 06:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
we we do get some briefings we do
 
06:13:23.708 --> 06:13:23.718 align:start position:0%
continue to to hear some discussion and
 
06:13:24.948 --> 06:13:24.958 align:start position:0%
if something were to change in the
 
06:13:27.150 --> 06:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
design of the program
 
06:13:29.030 --> 06:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
where we felt it was necessary to advise
 
06:13:30.390 --> 06:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
the governor that there would be an
 
06:13:32.390 --> 06:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
impact to New
 
06:13:34.948 --> 06:13:34.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a negative impact to not
 
06:13:36.750 --> 06:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
participating I guess that's a double
 
06:13:40.510 --> 06:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
negative but uh um we would we would
 
06:13:42.510 --> 06:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
then so advise but it would be again a
 
06:13:44.030 --> 06:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
decision of the governor as to whether
 
06:13:46.590 --> 06:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
we brought it forward to the legislature
 
06:13:48.750 --> 06:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
and um would be a decision of the
 
06:13:51.350 --> 06:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
legislature as to whether or not to uh
 
06:13:55.070 --> 06:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:56.910 --> 06:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
participation thank thank you
 
06:13:58.430 --> 06:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
representative cie pittz you have a
 
06:14:00.708 --> 06:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
question for Mr Fitzgerald yes Mr
 
06:14:02.708 --> 06:14:02.718 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald thank you for taking my
 
06:14:06.070 --> 06:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
question I I'm gonna make a statement
 
06:14:08.110 --> 06:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
first I just think this is a gag order
 
06:14:10.548 --> 06:14:10.558 align:start position:0%
there's a song that's go that comes from
 
06:14:13.270 --> 06:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
Hamilton in the room is it better to be
 
06:14:16.230 --> 06:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
in the room and hear things firsthand or
 
06:14:19.070 --> 06:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
to get your information either on
 
06:14:22.548 --> 06:14:22.558 align:start position:0%
paper or without discussion and without
 
06:14:26.070 --> 06:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
input do you consider that as good and
 
06:14:28.030 --> 06:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
the second part of that question would
 
06:14:30.990 --> 06:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
be does participating in these
 
06:14:33.510 --> 06:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
particular events cost an exorbitant
 
06:14:35.310 --> 06:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
06:14:38.110 --> 06:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
money well as you can see uh we the
 
06:14:40.270 --> 06:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
expenses you can see the expenses we did
 
06:14:41.830 --> 06:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
report again those are Personnel
 
06:14:43.468 --> 06:14:43.478 align:start position:0%
expenditures that would have been
 
06:14:45.468 --> 06:14:45.478 align:start position:0%
incurred one way or another they're not
 
06:14:47.830 --> 06:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
over and above our budget they weren't
 
06:14:51.910 --> 06:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
additional um uh staff were allocated to
 
06:14:54.230 --> 06:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
the uh to participate in these
 
06:14:56.910 --> 06:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
discussions um based on uh the interest
 
06:14:59.468 --> 06:14:59.478 align:start position:0%
of the governor's office um both prior
 
06:15:02.868 --> 06:15:02.878 align:start position:0%
go Governors and and the uh uh the
 
06:15:06.150 --> 06:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
current governor um we uh we were a we
 
06:15:08.310 --> 06:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
were able to Pro properly advise him we
 
06:15:11.350 --> 06:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
feel um I think one in answer to your
 
06:15:14.390 --> 06:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
question um about being in or out being
 
06:15:16.350 --> 06:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
in we are able to bring New Hampshire's
 
06:15:20.510 --> 06:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
interest to the table we are able to uh
 
06:15:23.510 --> 06:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know ensure that there's some
 
06:15:25.830 --> 06:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
consideration ultimately our decision
 
06:15:29.190 --> 06:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
May me to participate or not participate
 
06:15:31.910 --> 06:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
um and whether or not those factors that
 
06:15:33.548 --> 06:15:33.558 align:start position:0%
we bring forward but I do believe that
 
06:15:34.868 --> 06:15:34.878 align:start position:0%
we've had an
 
06:15:38.110 --> 06:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
outsized uh influence uh for instance in
 
06:15:40.590 --> 06:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
Reggie and we've been able to negotiate
 
06:15:42.788 --> 06:15:42.798 align:start position:0%
things that we think were important to
 
06:15:47.030 --> 06:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
keep uh uh you know to uh uh keep the
 
06:15:49.708 --> 06:15:49.718 align:start position:0%
program uh meeting the needs of the uh
 
06:15:51.350 --> 06:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
of the citizens of New Hampshire I'm
 
06:15:53.030 --> 06:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
continuing to receive the legislative
 
06:15:55.110 --> 06:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
approval I think it's the same with this
 
06:15:57.070 --> 06:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
if we're there we're able to to carry
 
06:15:59.548 --> 06:15:59.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's interests forward if not
 
06:16:01.310 --> 06:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
they're not heard or
 
06:16:04.830 --> 06:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
considered can I follow up followup very
 
06:16:09.030 --> 06:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
quickly um it this bill specifically
 
06:16:11.510 --> 06:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
designates Department of Environmental
 
06:16:14.628 --> 06:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
Services shall not are there any other
 
06:16:17.628 --> 06:16:17.638 align:start position:0%
departments or offices in the state of
 
06:16:20.030 --> 06:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that are designated to
 
06:16:22.548 --> 06:16:22.558 align:start position:0%
participate in these
 
06:16:24.788 --> 06:16:24.798 align:start position:0%
discussions uh we have been the primary
 
06:16:27.430 --> 06:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
participant uh we if there's a need we
 
06:16:29.150 --> 06:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
consult with the Department of
 
06:16:32.670 --> 06:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation um and we have at times
 
06:16:34.628 --> 06:16:34.638 align:start position:0%
um we've also discussed and consulted
 
06:16:37.030 --> 06:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
with uh uh what was the governor's
 
06:16:39.788 --> 06:16:39.798 align:start position:0%
office of energy now I believe it's OSI
 
06:16:43.708 --> 06:16:43.718 align:start position:0%
um so um we we have been the primary
 
06:16:46.670 --> 06:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
participant at the table um under Reggie
 
06:16:49.150 --> 06:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
there's two participants for the state
 
06:16:52.670 --> 06:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
there's the Pu and the state of New
 
06:16:55.110 --> 06:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are authorized to
 
06:16:56.910 --> 06:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
participate in the program and
 
06:17:01.350 --> 06:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
discussions and um uh in in this case uh
 
06:17:03.590 --> 06:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
this is just an idea at this time it's
 
06:17:06.510 --> 06:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
an initiative it's not hasn't been no
 
06:17:09.628 --> 06:17:09.638 align:start position:0%
pact has been formed anou was proposed
 
06:17:11.430 --> 06:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
we did not sign on to
 
06:17:16.070 --> 06:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
theou um but uh um we believe our in the
 
06:17:19.110 --> 06:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
state's interests were were at least
 
06:17:21.628 --> 06:17:21.638 align:start position:0%
heard thank
 
06:17:26.070 --> 06:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you um Mr Fitzgerald has a
 
06:17:29.670 --> 06:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
expressed a desire to leave um anytime
 
06:17:33.230 --> 06:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh between 4:15 and 4:30 so take that
 
06:17:35.670 --> 06:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
into to consideration as you contemplate
 
06:17:40.150 --> 06:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative um partiall
 
06:17:42.390 --> 06:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
no representative
 
06:17:45.350 --> 06:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
cran thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
06:17:46.868 --> 06:17:46.878 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald for taking my questions I'll
 
06:17:49.430 --> 06:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
be really quick um can you think of off
 
06:17:54.548 --> 06:17:54.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:57.708 --> 06:17:57.718 align:start position:0%
participating benefit
 
06:17:59.390 --> 06:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh again we have not been involved in
 
06:18:01.310 --> 06:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
the development discussion since last
 
06:18:02.990 --> 06:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
fall since the governor's announcement
 
06:18:05.310 --> 06:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
last fall so I'm not familiar with the
 
06:18:06.708 --> 06:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
where the where the program is headed
 
06:18:09.788 --> 06:18:09.798 align:start position:0%
but at the time it was a cap and invest
 
06:18:13.230 --> 06:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
program um it seems Seems possible to me
 
06:18:15.750 --> 06:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
that there would be some charge um
 
06:18:18.590 --> 06:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
associated with fuel usage uh on a
 
06:18:22.590 --> 06:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
regional basis and that um the uh return
 
06:18:25.030 --> 06:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
and investment would be allocated to the
 
06:18:26.948 --> 06:18:26.958 align:start position:0%
states so it's possible that it might
 
06:18:29.190 --> 06:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
that this could be analogous to Reggie
 
06:18:32.310 --> 06:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
but um again we're not party to those
 
06:18:34.948 --> 06:18:34.958 align:start position:0%
discussions anymore and I I couldn't say
 
06:18:38.270 --> 06:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
what the actual program design is is um
 
06:18:40.110 --> 06:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
coming to look like at this point in
 
06:18:41.910 --> 06:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
time we we've not continued our
 
06:18:43.868 --> 06:18:43.878 align:start position:0%
participation since La the governor's
 
06:18:46.190 --> 06:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
announcement last fall we did not sign
 
06:18:48.430 --> 06:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
theou so the states have not invited us
 
06:18:51.110 --> 06:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
to continue to
 
06:18:54.830 --> 06:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
participate thank you uh representative
 
06:18:54.840 --> 06:18:59.230 align:start position:0%
participate thank you uh representative
Harrington

06:18:59.230 --> 06:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:01.750 --> 06:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah uh thank you chairman uh uh Mike
 
06:19:04.390 --> 06:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
just a quick question um you're saying
 
06:19:07.190 --> 06:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
that as of right now effective for the
 
06:19:08.910 --> 06:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
rest of this year if nothing happens you
 
06:19:11.270 --> 06:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
will not spend any time or effort being
 
06:19:13.350 --> 06:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
involved in this thing because once the
 
06:19:14.948 --> 06:19:14.958 align:start position:0%
governor made a statement you basically
 
06:19:17.430 --> 06:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
stepped out of it that is correct and if
 
06:19:19.270 --> 06:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
you look at our expense allocation and
 
06:19:21.590 --> 06:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
our testimony letter you'll see that it
 
06:19:24.548 --> 06:19:24.558 align:start position:0%
declined dramatically um we may have a
 
06:19:26.430 --> 06:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
few hours here and there participating
 
06:19:29.230 --> 06:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
in calls that are open to us just to
 
06:19:31.430 --> 06:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
again to to hear what the direction and
 
06:19:33.868 --> 06:19:33.878 align:start position:0%
the thinking is and so on but um our
 
06:19:38.270 --> 06:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
participation at this point is uh um
 
06:19:41.468 --> 06:19:41.478 align:start position:0%
almost nothing thank
 
06:19:43.708 --> 06:19:43.718 align:start position:0%
you thank you and I would like to thank
 
06:19:45.868 --> 06:19:45.878 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr fitzell for making yourself
 
06:19:49.150 --> 06:19:49.160 align:start position:0%
available to um answer questions and I
 
06:19:51.190 --> 06:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
would like to also point out to the rest
 
06:19:53.230 --> 06:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
of the committee that Mr fitzgeral and I
 
06:19:56.390 --> 06:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
have been discussing a Time when we
 
06:19:58.750 --> 06:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
could have Dees come in and make a
 
06:20:01.948 --> 06:20:01.958 align:start position:0%
presentation to the committee it's uh
 
06:20:03.788 --> 06:20:03.798 align:start position:0%
difficult to schedule such a time right
 
06:20:07.788 --> 06:20:07.798 align:start position:0%
now but we're hoping that um maybe by
 
06:20:10.670 --> 06:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
early March or certainly by early April
 
06:20:13.150 --> 06:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to find such time so Mr D
 
06:20:15.310 --> 06:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
Mr fitzgeral will be back with other
 
06:20:17.910 --> 06:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
members of Dees to give us a full
 
06:20:19.750 --> 06:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
committee presentation so thank you Mr
 
06:20:21.590 --> 06:20:21.600 align:start position:0%

uh uh the next speaker on our list and
 
06:20:36.628 --> 06:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
06:20:40.830 --> 06:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
um Greg Moore from Americans for
 
06:20:43.070 --> 06:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
Prosperity Mr Moore you're
 
06:20:45.708 --> 06:20:45.718 align:start position:0%
on point of order Mr
 
06:20:48.590 --> 06:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
chair we did not hear from the sponsor
 
06:20:52.110 --> 06:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
of the bill because of Mr Fitzgerald's
 
06:20:53.468 --> 06:20:53.478 align:start position:0%
need to go
 
06:20:55.830 --> 06:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
first that's not correct we actually
 
06:20:59.030 --> 06:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
heard an introduction from Janine nter
 
06:21:01.390 --> 06:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
on the the contents of the bill and the
 
06:21:04.110 --> 06:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
rationale for its
 
06:21:06.150 --> 06:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
introduction I'm sorry if you missed
 
06:21:09.788 --> 06:21:09.798 align:start position:0%
that maybe I represent um Greg Moore
 
06:21:13.990 --> 06:21:14.000 align:start position:0%

06:21:16.390 --> 06:21:16.400 align:start position:0%

properly Mr
 
06:21:20.510 --> 06:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
chairman I didn't hear I didn't hear any
 
06:21:20.520 --> 06:21:22.990 align:start position:0%
chairman I didn't hear I didn't hear any
such

06:21:22.990 --> 06:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:26.150 --> 06:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
introduction so did you hear Janine n
 
06:21:29.548 --> 06:21:29.558 align:start position:0%
speak representative Janine nter I I
 
06:21:32.990 --> 06:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
think you were muted and I think she was
 
06:21:35.310 --> 06:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
muted we thought you were just talking
 
06:21:41.190 --> 06:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:43.670 --> 06:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
thing okay I was just informed that the
 
06:21:47.750 --> 06:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
room was muted apparently by accident so
 
06:21:49.670 --> 06:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative nder could you re
 
06:21:52.270 --> 06:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
introduce the Bill thank you very
 
06:21:54.548 --> 06:21:54.558 align:start position:0%
much take
 
06:21:54.558 --> 06:21:56.590 align:start position:0%
much take
two

06:21:56.590 --> 06:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
two
 
06:21:58.110 --> 06:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
I have to find My Notes because I gave
 
06:21:59.868 --> 06:21:59.878 align:start position:0%
them to him
 
06:22:02.788 --> 06:22:02.798 align:start position:0%
s you gave them back all right a little
 
06:22:05.910 --> 06:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
background first in 2012 the New
 
06:22:07.910 --> 06:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature passed a law that
 
06:22:10.390 --> 06:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire shall not join implement
 
06:22:13.150 --> 06:22:13.160 align:start position:0%
or participate in any state Regional or
 
06:22:15.628 --> 06:22:15.638 align:start position:0%
national lowc carbon fuel standards
 
06:22:18.030 --> 06:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
program or any similar program that
 
06:22:20.990 --> 06:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
requires quotas Caps or mandates on any
 
06:22:23.910 --> 06:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
fuels used for transportation industrial
 
06:22:26.708 --> 06:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
purposes or Home Heating without seeking
 
06:22:29.110 --> 06:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
prior legislative approval the
 
06:22:31.270 --> 06:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
transportation climate initiative is a
 
06:22:33.628 --> 06:22:33.638 align:start position:0%
regressive gas tax that
 
06:22:36.948 --> 06:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
increases ta I'm sorry is a regressive
 
06:22:39.750 --> 06:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
gas tax increase that harms those who
 
06:22:42.270 --> 06:22:42.280 align:start position:0%
can least afford it like the elderly on
 
06:22:44.948 --> 06:22:44.958 align:start position:0%
fixed incomes the Working Poor are those
 
06:22:46.830 --> 06:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
who commute to work like my adult
 
06:22:49.190 --> 06:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
children do they cannot afford to have
 
06:22:51.868 --> 06:22:51.878 align:start position:0%
to pay more at the gas pump it's unfair
 
06:22:54.708 --> 06:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
to place this burden on their backs it's
 
06:22:57.750 --> 06:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
no secret that I despise tax increases
 
06:23:00.190 --> 06:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
and it's never just for one thing it
 
06:23:02.948 --> 06:23:02.958 align:start position:0%
causes increases to everything connected
 
06:23:05.910 --> 06:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
to it nearly every product that we buy
 
06:23:09.030 --> 06:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
at the store is delivered by trucks TCI
 
06:23:11.430 --> 06:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
would drive up the cost of goods because
 
06:23:13.468 --> 06:23:13.478 align:start position:0%
it will cost more to run the trucks that
 
06:23:16.230 --> 06:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
deliver them the increase is then passed
 
06:23:17.468 --> 06:23:17.478 align:start position:0%
along to the
 
06:23:20.590 --> 06:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
consumers TCI would raise those taxes
 
06:23:24.030 --> 06:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
for years to come however unlike in the
 
06:23:26.590 --> 06:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
legislature where our constituents can
 
06:23:28.628 --> 06:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
hold us accountable for tax increases
 
06:23:31.430 --> 06:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
that hurt them in the wallet TCI shifts
 
06:23:34.310 --> 06:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of raising gas taxes
 
06:23:37.468 --> 06:23:37.478 align:start position:0%
to an unelected and unaccountable board
 
06:23:39.230 --> 06:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
the public deserves the right to know
 
06:23:41.150 --> 06:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
and hold responsible the people who are
 
06:23:43.708 --> 06:23:43.718 align:start position:0%
taking money out of their pocket
 
06:23:45.788 --> 06:23:45.798 align:start position:0%
Governor sonunu has confirmed that we
 
06:23:47.590 --> 06:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
will not be joining the transportation
 
06:23:50.590 --> 06:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
climate initiative but the TCI website
 
06:23:52.190 --> 06:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
shows that New Hampshire is a
 
06:23:54.030 --> 06:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
participant and the New Hampshire
 
06:23:56.548 --> 06:23:56.558 align:start position:0%
Department of environment Services has
 
06:23:59.750 --> 06:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
spent close to $50,000 I have the chart
 
06:24:02.628 --> 06:24:02.638 align:start position:0%
since 2012 to study the proposals that
 
06:24:04.830 --> 06:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
our state is banned from entering
 
06:24:06.910 --> 06:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
because the law still allows them to do
 
06:24:10.548 --> 06:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 373 will take out six
 
06:24:13.030 --> 06:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
words and replace them with we shall not
 
06:24:15.868 --> 06:24:15.878 align:start position:0%
participate to save Granite Staters some
 
06:24:18.230 --> 06:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
of their hard-earned money it should be
 
06:24:21.310 --> 06:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
the simplest Bill we bet all year I ask
 
06:24:23.910 --> 06:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
you to support House Bill 373 and pull
 
06:24:27.390 --> 06:24:27.400 align:start position:0%
the plug on TCI and stop having Dees
 
06:24:29.468 --> 06:24:29.478 align:start position:0%
staff from wasting time and money on a
 
06:24:34.430 --> 06:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:37.150 --> 06:24:37.160 align:start position:0%
participating okay thank you uh
 
06:24:39.670 --> 06:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative ner and my apologies to
 
06:24:41.830 --> 06:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
the committee for not realizing that the
 
06:24:43.910 --> 06:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
M the room was
 
06:24:48.830 --> 06:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
muted one of the uh many vagaries of
 
06:24:52.590 --> 06:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
doing community committee meetings using
 
06:24:54.868 --> 06:24:54.878 align:start position:0%
Zoom so are there any questions for
 
06:24:57.788 --> 06:24:57.798 align:start position:0%
represent ative n representative ssuch
 
06:25:00.270 --> 06:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a
 
06:25:02.590 --> 06:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
06:25:05.070 --> 06:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
you represent nter for taking my
 
06:25:08.948 --> 06:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
question uh I heard from you your
 
06:25:13.070 --> 06:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
motivation for this bill and but I don't
 
06:25:17.910 --> 06:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
see how this is anything about TCI TCI
 
06:25:19.990 --> 06:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
is currently an initiative and not
 
06:25:22.548 --> 06:25:22.558 align:start position:0%
really a a fleshed out
 
06:25:26.310 --> 06:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
proposal and so to to against it at this
 
06:25:28.190 --> 06:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
point makes no sense to me so my
 
06:25:31.150 --> 06:25:31.160 align:start position:0%
question to you is uh why why should we
 
06:25:33.670 --> 06:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
not even have a discussion why should we
 
06:25:36.110 --> 06:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
not have information we don't have to
 
06:25:38.430 --> 06:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
buy into it but we should be informed
 
06:25:40.628 --> 06:25:40.638 align:start position:0%
what's going on the other states around
 
06:25:44.350 --> 06:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
us together have a bigger influence on
 
06:25:46.788 --> 06:25:46.798 align:start position:0%
New England than we do and we will be
 
06:25:49.430 --> 06:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
dragged along unless we're at the table
 
06:25:51.150 --> 06:25:51.160 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't we have discussions and
 
06:25:51.160 --> 06:25:54.190 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't we have discussions and
information

06:25:54.190 --> 06:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:57.590 --> 06:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
Exchange it will TCI will raise the gas
 
06:26:00.350 --> 06:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
tax and it's going to keep going up and
 
06:26:02.468 --> 06:26:02.478 align:start position:0%
you know how I feel about
 
06:26:10.070 --> 06:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:12.948 --> 06:26:12.958 align:start position:0%
I'm right lost my train of thought here
 
06:26:16.830 --> 06:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry um oh they I have the chart of
 
06:26:18.468 --> 06:26:18.478 align:start position:0%
how much money they spent I mean I'm
 
06:26:20.670 --> 06:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
sure that they TCI has reports they
 
06:26:23.670 --> 06:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
could read without using the resources
 
06:26:27.270 --> 06:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:31.590 --> 06:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chairman follow up well
 
06:26:34.230 --> 06:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
again you referred T to CCI we shouldn't
 
06:26:37.070 --> 06:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
be supporting it but no one's no one has
 
06:26:39.788 --> 06:26:39.798 align:start position:0%
finalized that proposal it's like the
 
06:26:42.590 --> 06:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
draft of a treaty that you you're saying
 
06:26:44.468 --> 06:26:44.478 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to ratify even though it's
 
06:26:46.750 --> 06:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
not completed wh why shouldn't we be at
 
06:26:49.150 --> 06:26:49.160 align:start position:0%
the table until we have to make a
 
06:26:51.830 --> 06:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
decision because it costs money to do
 
06:26:54.310 --> 06:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
that and I ran as a fiscal conservative
 
06:26:55.670 --> 06:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
to try and
 
06:27:01.110 --> 06:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:03.788 --> 06:27:03.798 align:start position:0%
possible okay thank you uh
 
06:27:06.350 --> 06:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
representative McGee is recognized for a
 
06:27:08.990 --> 06:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
06:27:10.830 --> 06:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
you representative NADA for taking my
 
06:27:13.788 --> 06:27:13.798 align:start position:0%
question um I think us going back and
 
06:27:17.070 --> 06:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
forth about which programs are pending
 
06:27:19.430 --> 06:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh that might be affected by this
 
06:27:21.430 --> 06:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
change uh
 
06:27:24.910 --> 06:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
is is you know separate and distinct
 
06:27:26.548 --> 06:27:26.558 align:start position:0%
from what this change actually does
 
06:27:29.190 --> 06:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
because it's basically not saying New
 
06:27:30.750 --> 06:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire isn't going to participate in
 
06:27:33.270 --> 06:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
any low carbon programs it's saying that
 
06:27:35.830 --> 06:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
our Department of Environmental Services
 
06:27:38.468 --> 06:27:38.478 align:start position:0%
is prevented from having any involvement
 
06:27:40.350 --> 06:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
and can't do any planning and can't do
 
06:27:42.230 --> 06:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
any discussions with any other states in
 
06:27:45.868 --> 06:27:45.878 align:start position:0%
the region and my concern or my question
 
06:27:48.910 --> 06:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
to you is to me the Department of
 
06:27:51.110 --> 06:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services is a resource to
 
06:27:53.270 --> 06:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
us because they have information that we
 
06:27:56.030 --> 06:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
need and if we are telling them they can
 
06:27:58.110 --> 06:27:58.120 align:start position:0%
no longer participate in securing that
 
06:28:00.190 --> 06:28:00.200 align:start position:0%
information aren't we to go back to my
 
06:28:02.230 --> 06:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
original question to Mike Fitzgerald
 
06:28:03.788 --> 06:28:03.798 align:start position:0%
aren't we preventing them from doing
 
06:28:07.468 --> 06:28:07.478 align:start position:0%
their job and and I and the one caveat I
 
06:28:09.910 --> 06:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
just want to say I participated in the
 
06:28:12.070 --> 06:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
emissions commission over the summer
 
06:28:14.910 --> 06:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
with Senator Bradley and others and the
 
06:28:16.590 --> 06:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
06:28:19.110 --> 06:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
provided a really wonderful presentation
 
06:28:21.708 --> 06:28:21.718 align:start position:0%
to us where they uh were able to give us
 
06:28:23.548 --> 06:28:23.558 align:start position:0%
information we would not otherwise have
 
06:28:26.910 --> 06:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
had about um how the state has worked on
 
06:28:28.910 --> 06:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
lowering its emissions where we're at on
 
06:28:30.390 --> 06:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
that trajectory and that we're going to
 
06:28:33.830 --> 06:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
level off basically in 2021 without um
 
06:28:37.548 --> 06:28:37.558 align:start position:0%
without additional um policies to affect
 
06:28:39.270 --> 06:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
that that downward trajectory that we've
 
06:28:41.830 --> 06:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
been on they are the people who provide
 
06:28:45.830 --> 06:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
that information and a lot of what they
 
06:28:49.070 --> 06:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
were giving us had to be separated from
 
06:28:50.910 --> 06:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
what are other states doing what's
 
06:28:52.270 --> 06:28:52.280 align:start position:0%
happening in the region what's New
 
06:28:54.350 --> 06:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doing they can't do that if
 
06:28:55.910 --> 06:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
they if they can't work with anybody
 
06:28:58.150 --> 06:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
else if they're prevented from from
 
06:29:00.468 --> 06:29:00.478 align:start position:0%
doing that work so I that's what I don't
 
06:29:03.110 --> 06:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
understand is the words in this bill say
 
06:29:05.590 --> 06:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
06:29:07.868 --> 06:29:07.878 align:start position:0%
shall not participate in discussions or
 
06:29:10.750 --> 06:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
planning for any programs so it's not
 
06:29:13.230 --> 06:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
specific to TCI it basically says
 
06:29:15.670 --> 06:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
anything to do with us
 
06:29:18.670 --> 06:29:18.680 align:start position:0%
addressing uh our environmental
 
06:29:22.070 --> 06:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility on on emissions uh they
 
06:29:24.070 --> 06:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
can no longer provide us with that
 
06:29:25.990 --> 06:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
information because they they can't get
 
06:29:27.788 --> 06:29:27.798 align:start position:0%
it they can't work on
 
06:29:30.868 --> 06:29:30.878 align:start position:0%
it I just don't understand what the what
 
06:29:33.030 --> 06:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
the impetus is because like they said
 
06:29:34.590 --> 06:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
once the governor said we're not doing
 
06:29:38.070 --> 06:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
TCI they're not working on it um so this
 
06:29:40.350 --> 06:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
goes further this basically says it's a
 
06:29:44.070 --> 06:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
gag rule so so is there a question there
 
06:29:46.510 --> 06:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
representative mcge understand how
 
06:29:47.830 --> 06:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to do their job with
 
06:29:51.190 --> 06:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:53.868 --> 06:29:53.878 align:start position:0%
rule that was a very long long question
 
06:29:55.948 --> 06:29:55.958 align:start position:0%
I got lost in it somewhere but they're
 
06:29:57.868 --> 06:29:57.878 align:start position:0%
spending money on a program that we're
 
06:29:59.910 --> 06:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
not going to be a part of so why spend
 
06:30:02.350 --> 06:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
the money well we're paying them to do a
 
06:30:04.390 --> 06:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
job for us and this inhibits them from
 
06:30:06.590 --> 06:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
doing the job that's the way I see it
 
06:30:08.310 --> 06:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
remember we're not here to debate we're
 
06:30:10.310 --> 06:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
here to ask questions remember I
 
06:30:11.990 --> 06:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
understand I understand and it's the
 
06:30:13.270 --> 06:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
same question that I asked at the
 
06:30:14.750 --> 06:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
beginning is the Department of
 
06:30:16.270 --> 06:30:16.280 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services going to be
 
06:30:18.230 --> 06:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
inhibited from doing their job which we
 
06:30:21.430 --> 06:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
pay them to do by not being able to ask
 
06:30:23.830 --> 06:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
questions or participate okay that
 
06:30:25.750 --> 06:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
question was asked in and answered thank
 
06:30:29.548 --> 06:30:29.558 align:start position:0%
you so uh next up is uh representative
 
06:30:32.150 --> 06:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
cran Mr chairman I did not hear anyone
 
06:30:33.670 --> 06:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
answer that question that's why I'm
 
06:30:34.868 --> 06:30:34.878 align:start position:0%
posing it
 
06:30:37.030 --> 06:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
again I did not hear anyone answer I
 
06:30:39.030 --> 06:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
heard you asked that question of Mike
 
06:30:40.910 --> 06:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald when he was here and he
 
06:30:40.920 --> 06:30:41.948 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald when he was here and he
answered

06:30:41.948 --> 06:30:41.958 align:start position:0%
answered
 
06:30:44.788 --> 06:30:44.798 align:start position:0%
it okay so why ask it again I didn't
 
06:30:46.430 --> 06:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
hear him representative cran you're
 
06:30:47.830 --> 06:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
06:30:50.070 --> 06:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
06:30:52.430 --> 06:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
you representative not for taking my
 
06:30:55.270 --> 06:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
question um so understanding
 
06:30:57.350 --> 06:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
that your concern is that we are
 
06:31:00.030 --> 06:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
spending um we might be spending money
 
06:31:02.150 --> 06:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
that we don't have or don't want to
 
06:31:05.150 --> 06:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
spend are there any concerns that not
 
06:31:07.310 --> 06:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
being uh participating in these
 
06:31:09.708 --> 06:31:09.718 align:start position:0%
discussions or planning of programs
 
06:31:11.430 --> 06:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
might actually cost us money in the long
 
06:31:13.590 --> 06:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
run if things are happening that we're
 
06:31:16.590 --> 06:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
not aware of that we need to uh catch up
 
06:31:17.830 --> 06:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
with or or that we're going to be
 
06:31:17.840 --> 06:31:23.270 align:start position:0%
with or or that we're going to be
impacted

06:31:23.270 --> 06:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:26.230 --> 06:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
by I'm going to to um defer your
 
06:31:28.990 --> 06:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
question to um the next speaker that's
 
06:31:33.150 --> 06:31:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:35.830 --> 06:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
mind okay uh
 
06:31:37.830 --> 06:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative Cali pittz you're
 
06:31:40.948 --> 06:31:40.958 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question yeah I think
 
06:31:42.590 --> 06:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
my question is going to be referred but
 
06:31:44.110 --> 06:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
I have another question for
 
06:31:47.430 --> 06:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative ner representative ner
 
06:31:50.990 --> 06:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
why didn't you say that no Department
 
06:31:54.070 --> 06:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
shall not par shall not participate in
 
06:31:54.080 --> 06:31:55.230 align:start position:0%
shall not par shall not participate in
discussions

06:31:55.230 --> 06:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
06:31:58.948 --> 06:31:58.958 align:start position:0%
why Target Dees because we know that
 
06:32:00.990 --> 06:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
there are probably other people in the
 
06:32:03.670 --> 06:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
administration that could do this so it
 
06:32:08.590 --> 06:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
seems to me that um Dees is targeted
 
06:32:11.830 --> 06:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:14.350 --> 06:32:14.360 align:start position:0%
why because those are the figures that I
 
06:32:16.510 --> 06:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
have on how much they they have spent I
 
06:32:18.190 --> 06:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
don't have the figures from other
 
06:32:20.468 --> 06:32:20.478 align:start position:0%
departments if they're out there then I
 
06:32:22.830 --> 06:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
will address it in another
 
06:32:27.110 --> 06:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
bill may I follow up follow up what does
 
06:32:27.120 --> 06:32:28.670 align:start position:0%
bill may I follow up follow up what does
it

06:32:28.670 --> 06:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:32:32.430 --> 06:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
cost for people to listen and gain
 
06:32:34.868 --> 06:32:34.878 align:start position:0%
knowledge just like sitting here what
 
06:32:38.990 --> 06:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
does it cost me to listen and gain
 
06:32:42.030 --> 06:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge I I don't understand that is
 
06:32:44.548 --> 06:32:44.558 align:start position:0%
that what we're saying that it costs too
 
06:32:47.030 --> 06:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
much to
 
06:32:49.628 --> 06:32:49.638 align:start position:0%
listen that's a legitimate question
 
06:32:52.468 --> 06:32:52.478 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me that they cannot
 
06:32:55.430 --> 06:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
participate or commit the state to
 
06:32:57.990 --> 06:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
anything but they can listen and gain
 
06:32:59.830 --> 06:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge of what's going on around us
 
06:33:01.788 --> 06:33:01.798 align:start position:0%
and maybe what we should be doing okay
 
06:33:03.628 --> 06:33:03.638 align:start position:0%
you've asked the question can uh
 
06:33:06.868 --> 06:33:06.878 align:start position:0%
representative n respond you're asking
 
06:33:11.708 --> 06:33:11.718 align:start position:0%
what it costs it well in 2012 it cost
 
06:33:18.830 --> 06:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
$914 127 and 2013 $182 57 and 2014
 
06:33:22.868 --> 06:33:22.878 align:start position:0%
$533 20152 $
 
06:33:26.430 --> 06:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
42153 2017
 
06:33:30.070 --> 06:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
$3,251 2018 it was
 
06:33:34.310 --> 06:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:37.830 --> 06:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
8,980 43 and then in 2020
 
06:33:42.468 --> 06:33:42.478 align:start position:0%
$455 N3 that adds up to 4
 
06:33:42.478 --> 06:33:44.350 align:start position:0%
$455 N3 that adds up to 4
7,747

06:33:44.350 --> 06:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
7,747
 
06:33:47.510 --> 06:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
198 to listen to a a program that we're
 
06:33:50.430 --> 06:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
not going to be a part
 
06:33:54.628 --> 06:33:54.638 align:start position:0%
of okay uh representative crean you have
 
06:33:54.638 --> 06:33:56.070 align:start position:0%
of okay uh representative crean you have
another

06:33:56.070 --> 06:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
another
 
06:33:58.830 --> 06:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
question I do thank you chair um I was
 
06:34:00.150 --> 06:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
just wondering with those numbers can
 
06:34:02.510 --> 06:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
you give any insight as to why um in
 
06:34:04.868 --> 06:34:04.878 align:start position:0%
some years it was only like $100 and in
 
06:34:07.310 --> 06:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
other years it jumped to 3,000 what what
 
06:34:08.510 --> 06:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
was the difference
 
06:34:11.910 --> 06:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
there that would be a question for Mr
 
06:34:14.628 --> 06:34:14.638 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald I suspect it it has to do
 
06:34:16.788 --> 06:34:16.798 align:start position:0%
with how often the
 
06:34:20.708 --> 06:34:20.718 align:start position:0%
TCI U committee was meeting and how
 
06:34:25.510 --> 06:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
often de Dees uh listen to into those
 
06:34:28.750 --> 06:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
meetings but Mr fitzgeral would know for
 
06:34:31.750 --> 06:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
sure uh representative Jackie KY pittz
 
06:34:34.230 --> 06:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
you have another question I'm sorry no I
 
06:34:36.388 --> 06:34:36.398 align:start position:0%
I I'm gonna go back to Mr Fitzgerald's
 
06:34:38.628 --> 06:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
statement where he said that's not money
 
06:34:40.548 --> 06:34:40.558 align:start position:0%
that they would not have spent anyway
 
06:34:42.990 --> 06:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
because that's money they a portion to
 
06:34:45.190 --> 06:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
people so they have to account where the
 
06:34:47.230 --> 06:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
people are spending that money and it's
 
06:34:48.708 --> 06:34:48.718 align:start position:0%
money that would have been spent I just
 
06:34:51.590 --> 06:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify that that's what's his
 
06:34:54.628 --> 06:34:54.638 align:start position:0%
testimony okay thank you all right so
 
06:34:57.750 --> 06:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions for
 
06:35:00.468 --> 06:35:00.478 align:start position:0%
representative representative PL you
 
06:35:03.510 --> 06:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
have a question thank you Mr chair to
 
06:35:07.830 --> 06:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative n may I this uh
 
06:35:07.840 --> 06:35:09.070 align:start position:0%
representative n may I this uh
representative

06:35:09.070 --> 06:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:35:12.990 --> 06:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
n um can you build I'm sorry I can't
 
06:35:15.070 --> 06:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
hear you very
 
06:35:18.750 --> 06:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
well get closer to the microphone please
 
06:35:22.510 --> 06:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
in in this in the bill
 
06:35:25.510 --> 06:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
373 uh line
 
06:35:28.788 --> 06:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
three shall not participate in
 
06:35:32.190 --> 06:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
discussions or planning of such
 
06:35:36.270 --> 06:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
programs is it your intention that
 
06:35:38.868 --> 06:35:38.878 align:start position:0%
thees could not
 
06:35:42.230 --> 06:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
discuss any information they received
 
06:35:43.350 --> 06:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
from other
 
06:35:47.190 --> 06:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
states in DCS
 
06:35:52.190 --> 06:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:57.030 --> 06:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:00.030 --> 06:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
so the way I'm reading this if it
 
06:36:02.708 --> 06:36:02.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't need any clarification they are
 
06:36:06.788 --> 06:36:06.798 align:start position:0%
not to participate in the programs
 
06:36:10.070 --> 06:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
discussions or plannings with the
 
06:36:13.430 --> 06:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
program but they can still receive
 
06:36:16.590 --> 06:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
information into DCS and discuss it
 
06:36:18.590 --> 06:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
internally is that
 
06:36:20.708 --> 06:36:20.718 align:start position:0%
correct I believe
 
06:36:24.788 --> 06:36:24.798 align:start position:0%
so thank you what it say thank you
 
06:36:27.310 --> 06:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions from
 
06:36:28.990 --> 06:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
the committee we'll move on to our next
 
06:36:30.910 --> 06:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
speaker and I'd like to call on Greg
 
06:36:33.708 --> 06:36:33.718 align:start position:0%
Moore from Americans for Prosperity New
 
06:36:37.310 --> 06:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:40.548 --> 06:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
on thank you Mr chairman can you hear me
 
06:36:42.910 --> 06:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
we can thank you excellent always always
 
06:36:44.708 --> 06:36:44.718 align:start position:0%
a good idea to test before you just
 
06:36:47.510 --> 06:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
leave empty amounts of dead air uh for
 
06:36:49.310 --> 06:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
the for the record my name is Greg Moore
 
06:36:50.830 --> 06:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
I am the state director with Americans
 
06:36:53.628 --> 06:36:53.638 align:start position:0%
for Prosperity here in New Hampshire and
 
06:36:55.388 --> 06:36:55.398 align:start position:0%
uh if okay with the Indulgence of the
 
06:36:56.750 --> 06:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
chair would it be okay if I gave a
 
06:36:58.868 --> 06:36:58.878 align:start position:0%
little bit of the history involved with
 
06:37:00.350 --> 06:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
06:37:04.388 --> 06:37:04.398 align:start position:0%
program yes that's fine thank you uh so
 
06:37:06.388 --> 06:37:06.398 align:start position:0%
the history of this program dates back
 
06:37:10.030 --> 06:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
to 2009 when three Commissioners uh our
 
06:37:11.868 --> 06:37:11.878 align:start position:0%
commissioners of of then commissioners
 
06:37:11.878 --> 06:37:12.548 align:start position:0%
commissioners of of then commissioners
of

06:37:12.548 --> 06:37:12.558 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:37:14.670 --> 06:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh the Public Utility
 
06:37:17.070 --> 06:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
Commission and DEP Department of uh
 
06:37:19.468 --> 06:37:19.478 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services signed an MOA a
 
06:37:21.468 --> 06:37:21.478 align:start position:0%
memorandum of agreement to begin moving
 
06:37:24.468 --> 06:37:24.478 align:start position:0%
forward on a program relative to low
 
06:37:28.350 --> 06:37:28.360 align:start position:0%
carbon fuel standards uh to seek to
 
06:37:30.270 --> 06:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
reduce Transportation
 
06:37:32.548 --> 06:37:32.558 align:start position:0%
emissions now at at the time that that's
 
06:37:34.388 --> 06:37:34.398 align:start position:0%
what was about low car carbon fuel
 
06:37:36.948 --> 06:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
standards which mostly were focused on U
 
06:37:39.388 --> 06:37:39.398 align:start position:0%
Auto and and and gas standards things
 
06:37:41.430 --> 06:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
such as California emission styles are
 
06:37:43.468 --> 06:37:43.478 align:start position:0%
actual blends of gasoline that was the
 
06:37:45.670 --> 06:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
initial intent of moving
 
06:37:48.990 --> 06:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
forward and now in 2012 when I was
 
06:37:50.628 --> 06:37:50.638 align:start position:0%
serving as the chief of staff of the
 
06:37:53.310 --> 06:37:53.320 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives uh there was a
 
06:37:54.670 --> 06:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
there was legislation brought forward
 
06:37:57.150 --> 06:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
which is now seen before you which is
 
06:38:01.590 --> 06:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
21023 that was House Bill 1487 back then
 
06:38:03.670 --> 06:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh the speaker and the majority leader
 
06:38:05.590 --> 06:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
were on the bill so obviously I had a a
 
06:38:08.990 --> 06:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
keen interest in it and uh that
 
06:38:11.510 --> 06:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
basically uh took the approach and and
 
06:38:13.388 --> 06:38:13.398 align:start position:0%
the the the view that the legislature
 
06:38:15.388 --> 06:38:15.398 align:start position:0%
should be the policymaking body not the
 
06:38:17.910 --> 06:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
executive branch unlike Congress who
 
06:38:21.190 --> 06:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
likes to Outsource policym to to the
 
06:38:22.670 --> 06:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
executive branch here in New Hampshire
 
06:38:24.430 --> 06:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature historically has been
 
06:38:26.868 --> 06:38:26.878 align:start position:0%
the organization and the entity driving
 
06:38:31.070 --> 06:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
policy so uh that back in 2012 and and
 
06:38:34.150 --> 06:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
as Mr fitzerald pointed out the the
 
06:38:36.310 --> 06:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
Senate made a change to to ensure that
 
06:38:38.708 --> 06:38:38.718 align:start position:0%
Dees could continue to have the
 
06:38:41.388 --> 06:38:41.398 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh to discuss those plans
 
06:38:43.070 --> 06:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that we could have a
 
06:38:45.030 --> 06:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
chance to voice any concerns we we might
 
06:38:47.788 --> 06:38:47.798 align:start position:0%
have well fast forward seven years and
 
06:38:49.510 --> 06:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
now the low carbon fuel standards
 
06:38:51.510 --> 06:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
morphed into a regional cap and trade
 
06:38:54.110 --> 06:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
plan functionally it would work like a
 
06:38:56.708 --> 06:38:56.718 align:start position:0%
secondary gas tax gas and Diesel tax
 
06:38:58.468 --> 06:38:58.478 align:start position:0%
administered by a third party in a man
 
06:39:00.830 --> 06:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
manner similar to Reggie however an
 
06:39:02.468 --> 06:39:02.478 align:start position:0%
important distinction for Reggie between
 
06:39:03.830 --> 06:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
Reggie and the transportation climate
 
06:39:06.948 --> 06:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
initiative or TCI would have the ability
 
06:39:09.070 --> 06:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
to add or eliminate credits without
 
06:39:10.788 --> 06:39:10.798 align:start position:0%
authorization from the participating
 
06:39:12.468 --> 06:39:12.478 align:start position:0%
States meaning it functionally would
 
06:39:15.110 --> 06:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
have no direct oversight by the
 
06:39:17.548 --> 06:39:17.558 align:start position:0%
legislature this means a TCI could
 
06:39:20.948 --> 06:39:20.958 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease a secondary tax uh
 
06:39:22.990 --> 06:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
with no votes by the general court
 
06:39:24.708 --> 06:39:24.718 align:start position:0%
whereas with Reggie
 
06:39:27.468 --> 06:39:27.478 align:start position:0%
uh as as many of this committee know
 
06:39:29.230 --> 06:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
when when the number of credits is going
 
06:39:31.350 --> 06:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
to be increased or reduced it requires
 
06:39:33.388 --> 06:39:33.398 align:start position:0%
approval of the various particip
 
06:39:37.350 --> 06:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
participating States um and using using
 
06:39:40.150 --> 06:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
Reggie's I mean using tci's own numbers
 
06:39:45.150 --> 06:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
uh between 2022 so next year and 203 uh
 
06:39:45.160 --> 06:39:46.230 align:start position:0%
uh between 2022 so next year and 203 uh
and

06:39:46.230 --> 06:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:39:48.910 --> 06:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
2032 so over that 10 year period vehicle
 
06:39:52.830 --> 06:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
emissions will drop by 19% just by cars
 
06:39:55.230 --> 06:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
getting better mileage and switch over
 
06:39:57.590 --> 06:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
to electric vehicles uh during the
 
06:40:00.270 --> 06:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
initial roll out of TCA TCI back in
 
06:40:01.388 --> 06:40:01.398 align:start position:0%
December of
 
06:40:03.830 --> 06:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
2019 uh the planning effort suggested
 
06:40:05.548 --> 06:40:05.558 align:start position:0%
that TCI would further reduce those
 
06:40:08.350 --> 06:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
emissions by between 1 and 6% for a
 
06:40:10.110 --> 06:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
total uh emission reduction in the
 
06:40:13.150 --> 06:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
transportation sector of 20 to 25% when
 
06:40:15.430 --> 06:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
you add in the 19% that was already
 
06:40:19.030 --> 06:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
coming down the pike now TCI estimated
 
06:40:21.230 --> 06:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
uh that that would translate into a gas
 
06:40:23.590 --> 06:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
price increase of between 5 and 17 cents
 
06:40:26.708 --> 06:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
a gallon G however uh a detailed study
 
06:40:28.788 --> 06:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
by tus University that came out last
 
06:40:31.868 --> 06:40:31.878 align:start position:0%
year suggested a just a 3% reduction by
 
06:40:34.310 --> 06:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
of it TCI as a uh or an overall
 
06:40:37.150 --> 06:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
reduction of about 22% would result in a
 
06:40:39.388 --> 06:40:39.398 align:start position:0%
24 Cent per gallon increase in the price
 
06:40:41.788 --> 06:40:41.798 align:start position:0%
of gas so we are talking about a
 
06:40:44.708 --> 06:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
substantial hit at the pump and and by
 
06:40:46.708 --> 06:40:46.718 align:start position:0%
the way that's by Design uh since the
 
06:40:48.510 --> 06:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
stated goal is to reduce the use of
 
06:40:51.788 --> 06:40:51.798 align:start position:0%
gasoline and Diesel by make by making it
 
06:40:54.190 --> 06:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
uneconomical and so last month three
 
06:40:55.868 --> 06:40:55.878 align:start position:0%
states Massachusetts Connecticut and
 
06:40:58.150 --> 06:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island announced that they were
 
06:41:01.548 --> 06:41:01.558 align:start position:0%
signing anou uh at admissions reduction
 
06:41:04.868 --> 06:41:04.878 align:start position:0%
Target of 7% or 26% overall when you add
 
06:41:07.590 --> 06:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
the 19% in which is more than double the
 
06:41:11.388 --> 06:41:11.398 align:start position:0%
3% figure that the tough study use um
 
06:41:13.670 --> 06:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
and and moreover thatou is actually
 
06:41:16.628 --> 06:41:16.638 align:start position:0%
concrete mou it's it's not a um it's not
 
06:41:18.948 --> 06:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
a a hypothetical it is a a fairly
 
06:41:21.430 --> 06:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
concrete mou uh I have spent a fair
 
06:41:24.070 --> 06:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
amount of time listening in to the the
 
06:41:26.030 --> 06:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
TCI discussions one thing I'll say about
 
06:41:27.750 --> 06:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
them they are incredibly transparent
 
06:41:29.830 --> 06:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
they are open uh and those discussions
 
06:41:32.948 --> 06:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
are open for anyone to participate in
 
06:41:36.150 --> 06:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
and uh I've read through theou for this
 
06:41:38.670 --> 06:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
from the the states the three states
 
06:41:41.430 --> 06:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
south of us have signed and uh and that
 
06:41:42.590 --> 06:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
that is going to have a substantial
 
06:41:46.548 --> 06:41:46.558 align:start position:0%
impact uh going to that uh 7% reduction
 
06:41:48.150 --> 06:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
of Emissions on the price of gas and
 
06:41:50.830 --> 06:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
diesel in those States come
 
06:41:53.548 --> 06:41:53.558 align:start position:0%
2022 now uh a couple things to keep in
 
06:41:53.558 --> 06:41:54.270 align:start position:0%
2022 now uh a couple things to keep in
mind

06:41:54.270 --> 06:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
mind
 
06:41:59.230 --> 06:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
is that is that um you know at the at
 
06:42:00.788 --> 06:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
the very least I think representative n
 
06:42:02.708 --> 06:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
is concerned about the actual impact at
 
06:42:05.510 --> 06:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
the pump is a significant one however
 
06:42:07.110 --> 06:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
it's also important to understand that
 
06:42:08.788 --> 06:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
when a state like State like New
 
06:42:11.388 --> 06:42:11.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire starts using those resources
 
06:42:13.230 --> 06:42:13.240 align:start position:0%
to go and engage in these planning
 
06:42:14.948 --> 06:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
efforts those are resources that are not
 
06:42:17.830 --> 06:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
used elsewhere um as a former director
 
06:42:20.030 --> 06:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
at DHHS I've had a fair amount of
 
06:42:22.990 --> 06:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
experience of uh understanding at when
 
06:42:25.670 --> 06:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
you allocate staff to a goal those there
 
06:42:27.310 --> 06:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
are things that that staff can no longer
 
06:42:30.628 --> 06:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
otherwise do so Dees cannot otherwise do
 
06:42:32.670 --> 06:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
a number of other things if its staff is
 
06:42:34.670 --> 06:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
going to be heavily focused on something
 
06:42:36.628 --> 06:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
like the planning and implementation of
 
06:42:39.310 --> 06:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
of a program like TCI so for those
 
06:42:42.750 --> 06:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
reasons we support House Bill 373 uh
 
06:42:44.350 --> 06:42:44.360 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that again I've had a
 
06:42:46.708 --> 06:42:46.718 align:start position:0%
long history with and I'd be happy to
 
06:42:49.030 --> 06:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
answer any questions from the
 
06:42:51.830 --> 06:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr Moore we do have
 
06:42:54.590 --> 06:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
some questions first up is um
 
06:42:54.600 --> 06:42:59.030 align:start position:0%
some questions first up is um
representative

06:42:59.030 --> 06:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:01.388 --> 06:43:01.398 align:start position:0%
ssuch thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
06:43:04.510 --> 06:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr Moore for taking my question uh
 
06:43:08.190 --> 06:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
Mr Moore um did you help and assist in
 
06:43:09.510 --> 06:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
drafting this
 
06:43:11.548 --> 06:43:11.558 align:start position:0%
bill uh did I help and assist in
 
06:43:13.590 --> 06:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
drafting this legislation I I did have
 
06:43:16.468 --> 06:43:16.478 align:start position:0%
conversations with representative ner um
 
06:43:18.548 --> 06:43:18.558 align:start position:0%
at the at the early when when she first
 
06:43:19.830 --> 06:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
brought it to me
 
06:43:24.548 --> 06:43:24.558 align:start position:0%
yes okay followup Mr chairman followup
 
06:43:27.430 --> 06:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
and uh your organization Americans for
 
06:43:30.110 --> 06:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
Prosperity uh Nationwide is well known
 
06:43:32.590 --> 06:43:32.600 align:start position:0%
as a lobbyist group for Big Oil isn't
 
06:43:35.510 --> 06:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
that correct no that's not
 
06:43:38.030 --> 06:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
accurate how would you describe your
 
06:43:41.150 --> 06:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
organization our our organization is is
 
06:43:43.910 --> 06:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
a uh Grassroots uh focused citizen
 
06:43:45.830 --> 06:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
organization in New Hampshire we have
 
06:43:49.150 --> 06:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
over 51,000 individuals who who to take
 
06:43:52.230 --> 06:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
action with our organization and uh and
 
06:43:55.030 --> 06:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
and we are we are uh definitely focus on
 
06:43:57.868 --> 06:43:57.878 align:start position:0%
a whole host of issues uh energy being a
 
06:44:00.430 --> 06:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
very very very small one relative to the
 
06:44:02.628 --> 06:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
focus of a whole host of other areas
 
06:44:05.868 --> 06:44:05.878 align:start position:0%
including uh tax policy spending worker
 
06:44:08.590 --> 06:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
Freedom uh Criminal Justice Reform and
 
06:44:11.910 --> 06:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
issues like that okay thank you very
 
06:44:15.230 --> 06:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh representative pintel
 
06:44:20.070 --> 06:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:22.388 --> 06:44:22.398 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you very much Mr
 
06:44:24.230 --> 06:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
06:44:28.670 --> 06:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
so uh Mr Moore you stated that the uh
 
06:44:32.510 --> 06:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
the talks at TCI are very open and that
 
06:44:36.310 --> 06:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh anyone can listen in to what's going
 
06:44:40.070 --> 06:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
on and I guess my question is why do we
 
06:44:44.070 --> 06:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
not want Dees to listen in too if it's
 
06:44:44.080 --> 06:44:45.868 align:start position:0%
not want Dees to listen in too if it's
so

06:44:45.868 --> 06:44:45.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:44:49.750 --> 06:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
open thank you for the question uh again
 
06:44:52.070 --> 06:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity cost uh the time
 
06:44:54.350 --> 06:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
and energy that is used used and
 
06:44:58.070 --> 06:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
utilized to put focus on it on these
 
06:45:00.430 --> 06:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
planning efforts is time where the staff
 
06:45:03.948 --> 06:45:03.958 align:start position:0%
cannot otherwise engage in other uh ways
 
06:45:07.070 --> 06:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
of assisting New Hampshire residents of
 
06:45:08.590 --> 06:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
resolving other issues they have before
 
06:45:11.788 --> 06:45:11.798 align:start position:0%
the department the you again is not it's
 
06:45:13.468 --> 06:45:13.478 align:start position:0%
not an there is not an infinite amount
 
06:45:16.750 --> 06:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
of of time available uh staff staff
 
06:45:19.548 --> 06:45:19.558 align:start position:0%
resources are limited and when you take
 
06:45:21.990 --> 06:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
resources away from from one area to put
 
06:45:24.670 --> 06:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
it in another that other area is is
 
06:45:27.708 --> 06:45:27.718 align:start position:0%
lessened by that so without question uh
 
06:45:29.788 --> 06:45:29.798 align:start position:0%
again as someone who who's worked in the
 
06:45:31.030 --> 06:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
executive branch here in the state of
 
06:45:33.670 --> 06:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I have seen it firsthand
 
06:45:35.590 --> 06:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh if you if you the more tasks you give
 
06:45:37.948 --> 06:45:37.958 align:start position:0%
folks either either other tasks are not
 
06:45:39.468 --> 06:45:39.478 align:start position:0%
going to be done as well or other tasks
 
06:45:41.990 --> 06:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
are not going to be
 
06:45:45.388 --> 06:45:45.398 align:start position:0%
done follow thank you followup so why
 
06:45:47.590 --> 06:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
are you listening
 
06:45:51.990 --> 06:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
in because because the uh the impact of
 
06:45:54.070 --> 06:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
of TCI would be substan
 
06:45:57.670 --> 06:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
on the uh the motorists of New Hampshire
 
06:45:59.468 --> 06:45:59.478 align:start position:0%
it would have a a huge impact at the
 
06:46:01.310 --> 06:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
pump and and an impact that would
 
06:46:03.990 --> 06:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
continue to go up year year-over year
 
06:46:07.110 --> 06:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
the the stated goal of TCI is that they
 
06:46:10.310 --> 06:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
want to make the price of gas and Diesel
 
06:46:12.788 --> 06:46:12.798 align:start position:0%
uneconomical to to get people to shift
 
06:46:15.628 --> 06:46:15.638 align:start position:0%
their their habits to other modes of
 
06:46:17.788 --> 06:46:17.798 align:start position:0%
transportation whether that be public
 
06:46:21.350 --> 06:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
transit or other other areas but
 
06:46:23.628 --> 06:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
fundamentally um their goal is is to
 
06:46:26.468 --> 06:46:26.478 align:start position:0%
change the marketplace and and the way
 
06:46:29.070 --> 06:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
they Envision doing that is through is
 
06:46:32.030 --> 06:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
through making uh the use of gas and
 
06:46:32.040 --> 06:46:34.190 align:start position:0%
through making uh the use of gas and
Diesel

06:46:34.190 --> 06:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
Diesel
 
06:46:37.230 --> 06:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
uneconomical thank you Mr Moore okay
 
06:46:40.628 --> 06:46:40.638 align:start position:0%
thank you uh next up is representative
 
06:46:40.638 --> 06:46:43.750 align:start position:0%
thank you uh next up is representative
Cali

06:46:43.750 --> 06:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:47.788 --> 06:46:47.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:50.230 --> 06:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
unmute Mr Moore I want to thank you for
 
06:46:53.430 --> 06:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
your information which I gather you have
 
06:46:55.910 --> 06:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
have gleaned from extensive
 
06:46:59.830 --> 06:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
listening um I wonder can
 
06:47:02.430 --> 06:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
you because what I I think has been
 
06:47:06.468 --> 06:47:06.478 align:start position:0%
implied can you give me one
 
06:47:10.670 --> 06:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
instance where Dees has neglected to
 
06:47:12.590 --> 06:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
Performance duties because that's what
 
06:47:17.990 --> 06:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
it sounds like I I representative Nas
 
06:47:20.230 --> 06:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
Figures were pretty quick with me but I
 
06:47:23.030 --> 06:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
think they around $60,000 or so if I
 
06:47:26.548 --> 06:47:26.558 align:start position:0%
quick added them up my head but maybe
 
06:47:29.590 --> 06:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
less can you give me an instance where
 
06:47:32.868 --> 06:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
you believe that funds have been
 
06:47:35.750 --> 06:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
misdirected representative C pittz that
 
06:47:37.670 --> 06:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
question doesn't relate to the substance
 
06:47:40.830 --> 06:47:40.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill it certainly does Mr chair I
 
06:47:42.830 --> 06:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
beg to differ with you because what I'm
 
06:47:45.750 --> 06:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
hearing is that because we spend money
 
06:47:49.190 --> 06:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
on this program or on learning about
 
06:47:52.030 --> 06:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
this program we can't spend money doing
 
06:47:54.708 --> 06:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
that program and that's what was said
 
06:47:57.110 --> 06:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
and I think that was the reason given by
 
06:48:00.910 --> 06:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
Mrs Miss ner and I Mrs N and I think
 
06:48:03.230 --> 06:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
that was the reason that I just heard
 
06:48:05.830 --> 06:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
from Mr Moore so I want to know that
 
06:48:08.388 --> 06:48:08.398 align:start position:0%
because if if he believes that funds are
 
06:48:11.190 --> 06:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
being misdirected because we're spending
 
06:48:14.868 --> 06:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
too much time learn giving information
 
06:48:17.910 --> 06:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
or seeking information then I think
 
06:48:21.150 --> 06:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps we ought to know about that and
 
06:48:23.468 --> 06:48:23.478 align:start position:0%
I well if he said that then why AR you
 
06:48:26.590 --> 06:48:26.600 align:start position:0%
asking the question again because I want
 
06:48:28.350 --> 06:48:28.360 align:start position:0%
to know if he can give me an instance
 
06:48:30.788 --> 06:48:30.798 align:start position:0%
where that's if this is an allegation I
 
06:48:32.830 --> 06:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
want to know if he can give me an
 
06:48:34.868 --> 06:48:34.878 align:start position:0%
instance all right I'll allow it go
 
06:48:37.910 --> 06:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
ahead Mr Moore representative CIP pitz
 
06:48:40.230 --> 06:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question uh the the the
 
06:48:42.350 --> 06:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
answer is as I mentioned it's it's a
 
06:48:45.110 --> 06:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
matter of overall resource allocation
 
06:48:48.070 --> 06:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
and and if you're asking for a specific
 
06:48:50.430 --> 06:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
instance in the in the uh air division
 
06:48:53.230 --> 06:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
of Dees I certainly I certainly would
 
06:48:55.788 --> 06:48:55.798 align:start position:0%
would encourage people to talk to people
 
06:48:57.430 --> 06:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
about the Shoreland protection division
 
06:48:59.150 --> 06:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
that's a whole separate question but I I
 
06:49:01.430 --> 06:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
suspect that it's different Personnel
 
06:49:03.110 --> 06:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
from Shoreland protection and then over
 
06:49:07.468 --> 06:49:07.478 align:start position:0%
at air but uh at at as far as a specific
 
06:49:09.548 --> 06:49:09.558 align:start position:0%
instance I don't but I do know that
 
06:49:12.070 --> 06:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
there is a that there is a finite amount
 
06:49:14.030 --> 06:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
of work that you can ask a finite amount
 
06:49:17.948 --> 06:49:17.958 align:start position:0%
of staff to do and those staffers uh
 
06:49:20.110 --> 06:49:20.120 align:start position:0%
when they are diverted to one area they
 
06:49:22.468 --> 06:49:22.478 align:start position:0%
cannot do other work that doesn't mean
 
06:49:24.788 --> 06:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
necessarily that that someone
 
06:49:26.670 --> 06:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily was left without any
 
06:49:28.430 --> 06:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
Services what it means is they they
 
06:49:29.990 --> 06:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
could have perhaps gotten better or
 
06:49:32.230 --> 06:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
quicker services to turnaround times on
 
06:49:34.708 --> 06:49:34.718 align:start position:0%
permits for example who knows how long
 
06:49:36.150 --> 06:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps it might they might have moved
 
06:49:38.468 --> 06:49:38.478 align:start position:0%
faster had had more resources been
 
06:49:40.990 --> 06:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated towards that but but in a
 
06:49:42.788 --> 06:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
management position at a large state
 
06:49:45.350 --> 06:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
agency like Dees is you are constantly
 
06:49:47.910 --> 06:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
focused on the allocation of the time
 
06:49:50.110 --> 06:49:50.120 align:start position:0%
resources of your staff it is a critical
 
06:49:53.110 --> 06:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
component to having any sort of
 
06:49:57.070 --> 06:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
successful uh successful effort and when
 
06:49:58.670 --> 06:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
you're when you're coming and dealing
 
06:50:01.030 --> 06:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
with as many legislative mandates as you
 
06:50:03.310 --> 06:50:03.320 align:start position:0%
as the folks in this committee give
 
06:50:05.910 --> 06:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
these these uh these individuals they
 
06:50:09.388 --> 06:50:09.398 align:start position:0%
cannot continue to do everything and and
 
06:50:12.830 --> 06:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
not have something suffer for lack of
 
06:50:15.948 --> 06:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
resources okay thank you uh we have four
 
06:50:18.150 --> 06:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
more people who have signed up to speak
 
06:50:20.548 --> 06:50:20.558 align:start position:0%
so I would just remind everyone of that
 
06:50:23.548 --> 06:50:23.558 align:start position:0%
and it is currently 9 minutes before 5
 
06:50:26.388 --> 06:50:26.398 align:start position:0%
and the speaker has asked us to exit the
 
06:50:29.070 --> 06:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
building at 5:00 so keep that in mind as
 
06:50:30.990 --> 06:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
you ask your questions representative
 
06:50:33.670 --> 06:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
McGee you're recognized for a question
 
06:50:35.388 --> 06:50:35.398 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
06:50:38.468 --> 06:50:38.478 align:start position:0%
Moore for taking my question um you just
 
06:50:42.468 --> 06:50:42.478 align:start position:0%
represented tci's Mission as making gas
 
06:50:45.230 --> 06:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
uneconomical and when I heard about the
 
06:50:47.548 --> 06:50:47.558 align:start position:0%
TCI Regional initiative what I heard was
 
06:50:50.270 --> 06:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
that they were looking at the uh
 
06:50:53.030 --> 06:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation sector as the next large
 
06:50:55.510 --> 06:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
sector that they wanted to address in
 
06:50:57.430 --> 06:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
terms of lowering emissions and for some
 
06:50:59.150 --> 06:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
of us we're still looking at the
 
06:51:02.388 --> 06:51:02.398 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts and cost of us not
 
06:51:05.468 --> 06:51:05.478 align:start position:0%
participating and also not addressing
 
06:51:07.030 --> 06:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
what is happening because of those
 
06:51:10.430 --> 06:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
admissions so I I I want to know if you
 
06:51:12.990 --> 06:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
can answer for us since you presented
 
06:51:15.910 --> 06:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
this from your perspective if you can
 
06:51:18.868 --> 06:51:18.878 align:start position:0%
actually tell us anymore about that
 
06:51:22.468 --> 06:51:22.478 align:start position:0%
perspective because you you said that
 
06:51:23.910 --> 06:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
that America Americans for for
 
06:51:25.868 --> 06:51:25.878 align:start position:0%
Prosperity as a Grassroots organization
 
06:51:27.510 --> 06:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
but how are you
 
06:51:31.388 --> 06:51:31.398 align:start position:0%
funded uh we are funded by over 100,000
 
06:51:34.468 --> 06:51:34.478 align:start position:0%
donors um a number here in in New
 
06:51:37.468 --> 06:51:37.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire probably about 1500 here in
 
06:51:41.110 --> 06:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh and that I understand
 
06:51:42.150 --> 06:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
that that's not gerain of the
 
06:51:43.910 --> 06:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
legislation I would I would like to
 
06:51:45.990 --> 06:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
correct one thing I I hope that I didn't
 
06:51:47.430 --> 06:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
give the impression that it is their
 
06:51:49.788 --> 06:51:49.798 align:start position:0%
mission to make gas and Diesel
 
06:51:52.388 --> 06:51:52.398 align:start position:0%
uneconomical uh but it is their intent
 
06:51:54.110 --> 06:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
and I I understand that's an important
 
06:51:55.590 --> 06:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
distinction between a mission and an
 
06:51:59.788 --> 06:51:59.798 align:start position:0%
intent but they but they they they don't
 
06:52:02.310 --> 06:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
they don't uh mince words about that
 
06:52:04.468 --> 06:52:04.478 align:start position:0%
they they realize that that the way to
 
06:52:06.430 --> 06:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
get there or they believe the way to get
 
06:52:07.910 --> 06:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
there is not through mandates in fact
 
06:52:10.030 --> 06:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
that's how where they began they began
 
06:52:12.070 --> 06:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
the process of doing lowc carbon fuel
 
06:52:15.310 --> 06:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
standards of actually doing mandates and
 
06:52:17.230 --> 06:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
they felt as though a better a better
 
06:52:19.910 --> 06:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle would be to would be to make uh
 
06:52:22.270 --> 06:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
gas and Diesel less economical as a more
 
06:52:24.510 --> 06:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
effective strategy of actually reducing
 
06:52:27.628 --> 06:52:27.638 align:start position:0%
emissions than uh than than doing things
 
06:52:29.070 --> 06:52:29.080 align:start position:0%
that they had initially proposed like
 
06:52:30.590 --> 06:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
having all the states in the region Pass
 
06:52:32.708 --> 06:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
California Miss Mission standards like
 
06:52:34.750 --> 06:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
changing the fuel Blends and they felt
 
06:52:36.788 --> 06:52:36.798 align:start position:0%
it was a better a better vehicle or
 
06:52:39.030 --> 06:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
better tool to accomplish that
 
06:52:40.708 --> 06:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
accomplish that does that answer your
 
06:52:43.310 --> 06:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
question representative I just yeah what
 
06:52:45.150 --> 06:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
what what you said made me think of one
 
06:52:47.270 --> 06:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
other thing I could ask you so is what
 
06:52:49.388 --> 06:52:49.398 align:start position:0%
you're saying that they're trying to go
 
06:52:52.230 --> 06:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
directly to a market Solution by taking
 
06:52:53.310 --> 06:52:53.320 align:start position:0%
the external
 
06:52:54.830 --> 06:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
costs and putting them into the price of
 
06:52:57.190 --> 06:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
the product because that's what I see it
 
06:53:00.468 --> 06:53:00.478 align:start position:0%
as when I look what would think that if
 
06:53:02.830 --> 06:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
it were a true cap and trade program the
 
06:53:05.910 --> 06:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
the issue one of the issues with um with
 
06:53:07.388 --> 06:53:07.398 align:start position:0%
TCI that's very different from the
 
06:53:09.670 --> 06:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
regional greenhouse gas initiative is
 
06:53:12.310 --> 06:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
that TCI actually has what they call a
 
06:53:14.510 --> 06:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
circuit breaker meaning that if the
 
06:53:16.670 --> 06:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
price of gasoline were to increase too
 
06:53:19.350 --> 06:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
much um that they would just add more
 
06:53:22.910 --> 06:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
credits so or if they felt like but they
 
06:53:24.468 --> 06:53:24.478 align:start position:0%
felt like the price of gasoline hadn't
 
06:53:26.310 --> 06:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
gone up enough they would they would
 
06:53:28.110 --> 06:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of credits so in other
 
06:53:29.708 --> 06:53:29.718 align:start position:0%
words clearly they have a target for how
 
06:53:31.230 --> 06:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
much they want to increase the price of
 
06:53:33.868 --> 06:53:33.878 align:start position:0%
gasoline in their head and they would
 
06:53:37.230 --> 06:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
they would execute execute um with that
 
06:53:40.150 --> 06:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
goal in mind that's not Market related
 
06:53:42.510 --> 06:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
that that that's command and control and
 
06:53:43.830 --> 06:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's an important
 
06:53:45.430 --> 06:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
distinction uh between that and the
 
06:53:47.350 --> 06:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
regional greenhouse gas initiative
 
06:53:50.830 --> 06:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
whereas whereas with Reggie when you
 
06:53:53.110 --> 06:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
want to reduce Reggie credits Reg comes
 
06:53:54.788 --> 06:53:54.798 align:start position:0%
before the the participating States and
 
06:53:57.190 --> 06:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
say and says vote on this whereas TCI
 
06:53:59.110 --> 06:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
would be able to change a number of
 
06:54:01.910 --> 06:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
credits uh without without any any
 
06:54:04.670 --> 06:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
involvement of of the legislature or or
 
06:54:05.948 --> 06:54:05.958 align:start position:0%
either of the states whoever is
 
06:54:07.910 --> 06:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
authorized within the state to make that
 
06:54:11.868 --> 06:54:11.878 align:start position:0%
decision um and as as a legislature with
 
06:54:13.628 --> 06:54:13.638 align:start position:0%
with Reggie none of that would take
 
06:54:16.310 --> 06:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
place with TCI okay and I would very
 
06:54:19.150 --> 06:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
much like I would I would remind members
 
06:54:20.708 --> 06:54:20.718 align:start position:0%
that we're not here to debate we're here
 
06:54:23.230 --> 06:54:23.240 align:start position:0%
to ask questions and
 
06:54:25.190 --> 06:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
debating about the climate
 
06:54:27.590 --> 06:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
Transportation climate initiative is not
 
06:54:29.190 --> 06:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
the subject of the bill the subject of
 
06:54:32.150 --> 06:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
the bill is much more narrow than that
 
06:54:35.750 --> 06:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
so um I would also remind members that
 
06:54:37.750 --> 06:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
if we
 
06:54:40.670 --> 06:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh stay in this meeting room Beyond five
 
06:54:44.110 --> 06:54:44.120 align:start position:0%
o'clock we're imposing on the staff of
 
06:54:47.270 --> 06:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
the uh legislative office building who
 
06:54:49.990 --> 06:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
have lives and would like to go home at
 
06:54:53.110 --> 06:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
a reasonable hour so with that said
 
06:54:55.230 --> 06:54:55.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative crean you're
 
06:54:57.388 --> 06:54:57.398 align:start position:0%
authorized to ask a
 
06:54:59.830 --> 06:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
question Mr chair and thank you Mr Moore
 
06:55:02.830 --> 06:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um getting back
 
06:55:07.110 --> 06:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
to this issue of being germine I see
 
06:55:09.670 --> 06:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
this bill as sort of inappropriately
 
06:55:12.110 --> 06:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
micromanaging how Dees is spending their
 
06:55:14.948 --> 06:55:14.958 align:start position:0%
time can you give me any other examples
 
06:55:17.708 --> 06:55:17.718 align:start position:0%
where we've forbid agency staff from
 
06:55:19.788 --> 06:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
participating in particular meetings or
 
06:55:22.990 --> 06:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
topics um in the interest of telling
 
06:55:24.750 --> 06:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
them how they need to spend their time
 
06:55:28.190 --> 06:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
to achieve their goals so I appreciate
 
06:55:30.070 --> 06:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
your comment but remember we're here to
 
06:55:32.750 --> 06:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
ask questions not to deliver our
 
06:55:35.270 --> 06:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
opinions I I was asking if there were
 
06:55:37.388 --> 06:55:37.398 align:start position:0%
any other examples of places where we're
 
06:55:40.070 --> 06:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
telling Dees that they can't weigh in on
 
06:55:43.150 --> 06:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
a particular Topic in the interest of
 
06:55:44.868 --> 06:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
making them more
 
06:55:47.590 --> 06:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
efficient so so first of all
 
06:55:48.468 --> 06:55:48.478 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
 
06:55:50.190 --> 06:55:50.200 align:start position:0%
question and if I if I might do a quick
 
06:55:52.628 --> 06:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
aside I want to give my best to
 
06:55:54.388 --> 06:55:54.398 align:start position:0%
representative PL it's great to see him
 
06:55:57.230 --> 06:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
on on the camera so great to see you
 
06:56:00.788 --> 06:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
representative uh and to to answer the
 
06:56:02.910 --> 06:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
question I I will say I have worked both
 
06:56:05.230 --> 06:56:05.240 align:start position:0%
in the legislative and in the executive
 
06:56:08.510 --> 06:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
branch of government and the answer is
 
06:56:10.468 --> 06:56:10.478 align:start position:0%
constantly uh the legislature does
 
06:56:12.628 --> 06:56:12.638 align:start position:0%
micromanage if you if you're sitting in
 
06:56:15.350 --> 06:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
the executive's perspective uh if you're
 
06:56:18.070 --> 06:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
in the in the agencies you you feel a
 
06:56:19.948 --> 06:56:19.958 align:start position:0%
constant pressure of micromanagement
 
06:56:21.910 --> 06:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
that's taking place uh by the
 
06:56:21.920 --> 06:56:23.030 align:start position:0%
that's taking place uh by the
legislature

06:56:23.030 --> 06:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
06:56:24.788 --> 06:56:24.798 align:start position:0%
when you're in a legislative perspective
 
06:56:26.468 --> 06:56:26.478 align:start position:0%
you're you're simply ex executing your
 
06:56:30.030 --> 06:56:30.040 align:start position:0%
priorities so it really depends on Whose
 
06:56:32.310 --> 06:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
seat you're sitting in uh as to how what
 
06:56:35.190 --> 06:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
your perspective on that I I agree with
 
06:56:36.830 --> 06:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
the legislator's perspective I think
 
06:56:38.868 --> 06:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
it's better that elected people actually
 
06:56:40.990 --> 06:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
make the decisions and set the policy
 
06:56:42.350 --> 06:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
and I understand that the executive
 
06:56:43.510 --> 06:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
branch will always view that as
 
06:56:45.388 --> 06:56:45.398 align:start position:0%
micromanagement but I actually view it
 
06:56:47.110 --> 06:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
as a good thing and I that's someone who
 
06:56:49.310 --> 06:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
been on both sides of the
 
06:56:52.990 --> 06:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
fence thank you for that uh response
 
06:56:55.388 --> 06:56:55.398 align:start position:0%
uh representative man you recognized no
 
06:56:58.030 --> 06:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
representative man put his hand down so
 
06:57:00.030 --> 06:57:00.040 align:start position:0%
I guess we're done um uh with
 
06:57:01.670 --> 06:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative Mo I'd like to call on
 
06:57:05.110 --> 06:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
the next speaker who is Paul Nikolai who
 
06:57:07.990 --> 06:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
represents the granite state taxpayers
 
06:57:14.590 --> 06:57:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:18.030 --> 06:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
on don't forget to unmute yourself okay
 
06:57:21.628 --> 06:57:21.638 align:start position:0%
so did that work yes we can hear you now
 
06:57:22.990 --> 06:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman chman and members
 
06:57:25.468 --> 06:57:25.478 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm Paul Nicolai and
 
06:57:27.590 --> 06:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
I'm from Grandam I'm here today as a
 
06:57:30.270 --> 06:57:30.280 align:start position:0%
Granite State taxpayer board member I
 
06:57:32.070 --> 06:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
and the granite state taxpayers are here
 
06:57:34.468 --> 06:57:34.478 align:start position:0%
to request that you recommend that HB
 
06:57:37.468 --> 06:57:37.478 align:start position:0%
373 ought to pass we don't have to
 
06:57:40.110 --> 06:57:40.120 align:start position:0%
debate climate change or global warming
 
06:57:42.628 --> 06:57:42.638 align:start position:0%
to talk about this bill the bill ought
 
06:57:44.190 --> 06:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
to pass to prevent a waste of New
 
06:57:46.910 --> 06:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayer money regardless of
 
06:57:49.070 --> 06:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
your position on global change or global
 
06:57:51.628 --> 06:57:51.638 align:start position:0%
climate change or global warming it is
 
06:57:54.708 --> 06:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
in fact a Global issue New Hampshire's
 
06:57:57.230 --> 06:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
contribution to global warming is
 
06:57:59.548 --> 06:57:59.558 align:start position:0%
minuscule New Hampshire's contribution
 
06:58:02.628 --> 06:58:02.638 align:start position:0%
to any proposed solution will also be
 
06:58:05.230 --> 06:58:05.240 align:start position:0%
minuscule that's because New Hampshire
 
06:58:09.270 --> 06:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
is thankfully minuscule Mr fitgerald
 
06:58:12.230 --> 06:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
even said he effectively confirmed this
 
06:58:14.430 --> 06:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
when he said that we participate in the
 
06:58:17.070 --> 06:58:17.080 align:start position:0%
discussions but nowhere did you hear
 
06:58:20.628 --> 06:58:20.638 align:start position:0%
that the result of TCI or any other
 
06:58:23.670 --> 06:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
program was changed Ed because of New
 
06:58:25.708 --> 06:58:25.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's position and if you think
 
06:58:28.708 --> 06:58:28.718 align:start position:0%
about that it makes sense they have 98%
 
06:58:30.270 --> 06:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
of the problem they're going to
 
06:58:33.350 --> 06:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
contribute 98% of the solution whatever
 
06:58:35.788 --> 06:58:35.798 align:start position:0%
we're going to do is an afterthought if
 
06:58:39.590 --> 06:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
in fact tomorrow New Hampshire emitted
 
06:58:43.468 --> 06:58:43.478 align:start position:0%
zero carbon nobody would notice
 
06:58:46.388 --> 06:58:46.398 align:start position:0%
including the environment
 
06:58:49.708 --> 06:58:49.718 align:start position:0%
so whether we're at the table or not the
 
06:58:51.190 --> 06:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
result of what happens in these
 
06:58:53.788 --> 06:58:53.798 align:start position:0%
deliberations is going to be the same we
 
06:58:55.628 --> 06:58:55.638 align:start position:0%
can read about it in the newspapers we
 
06:58:57.388 --> 06:58:57.398 align:start position:0%
can get the press releases we can see
 
06:58:59.910 --> 06:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
all the documents these are after all
 
06:59:02.670 --> 06:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
public agencies the public has as much
 
06:59:04.830 --> 06:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
access to what they do as we have to
 
06:59:07.670 --> 06:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here today so given
 
06:59:09.990 --> 06:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
that it's a far more effective use of
 
06:59:14.110 --> 06:59:14.120 align:start position:0%
our tax dollars to not divert staff into
 
06:59:16.310 --> 06:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
discussions and debates where we will
 
06:59:18.910 --> 06:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
have no effect we should rather have
 
06:59:21.030 --> 06:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
them work on things that we can affect
 
06:59:22.708 --> 06:59:22.718 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and that is for the
 
06:59:24.868 --> 06:59:24.878 align:start position:0%
benefit of New Hampshire people so it's
 
06:59:26.708 --> 06:59:26.718 align:start position:0%
far more effective to use our tax
 
06:59:29.510 --> 06:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
dollars to Simply analyze the result of
 
06:59:32.708 --> 06:59:32.718 align:start position:0%
these multi-year debates and then decide
 
06:59:34.868 --> 06:59:34.878 align:start position:0%
whether we want to join the program or
 
06:59:37.468 --> 06:59:37.478 align:start position:0%
not for that reason you should recommend
 
06:59:40.190 --> 06:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
that HB 373 ought to pass and I thank
 
06:59:43.230 --> 06:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:45.948 --> 06:59:45.958 align:start position:0%
time thank you are there any questions
 
06:59:47.990 --> 06:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
for Mr
 
06:59:50.070 --> 06:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
Nikolai did you provide written
 
06:59:53.910 --> 06:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr Nikolai I did not
 
06:59:56.310 --> 06:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh could you we'd appreciate it if you
 
06:59:59.590 --> 06:59:59.600 align:start position:0%

06:59:59.600 --> 07:00:01.030 align:start position:0%
could I will do that thank you we would
appreciate

07:00:01.030 --> 07:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
07:00:03.548 --> 07:00:03.558 align:start position:0%
that all right seeing no questions for
 
07:00:05.510 --> 07:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Nikolai I will call on the next
 
07:00:09.110 --> 07:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
speaker who is Joseph kwasnik Mr kwasnik
 
07:00:09.120 --> 07:00:17.670 align:start position:0%
speaker who is Joseph kwasnik Mr kwasnik
you're

07:00:17.670 --> 07:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:20.628 --> 07:00:20.638 align:start position:0%
on go ahead yes Mr chairman can you hear
 
07:00:22.670 --> 07:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
me I can
 
07:00:24.548 --> 07:00:24.558 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh just a couple of
 
07:00:26.948 --> 07:00:26.958 align:start position:0%
points one is um I actually participated
 
07:00:28.868 --> 07:00:28.878 align:start position:0%
in the development of Reggie back in the
 
07:00:31.030 --> 07:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
back in its formative days so I do bring
 
07:00:33.990 --> 07:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
that perspective of uh all the states
 
07:00:35.230 --> 07:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
that participate in Reggie which
 
07:00:36.548 --> 07:00:36.558 align:start position:0%
included all the New England states
 
07:00:39.708 --> 07:00:39.718 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire I found that um
 
07:00:41.590 --> 07:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
those participants from the states and
 
07:00:43.990 --> 07:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
other organizations actually had quite
 
07:00:48.150 --> 07:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
an effect on um on shaping this the uh
 
07:00:50.310 --> 07:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
the uh the development of Reggie
 
07:00:51.548 --> 07:00:51.558 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire even though
 
07:00:53.830 --> 07:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
we're a small state it had an
 
07:00:56.510 --> 07:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
outstanding um uh influence on how
 
07:00:59.310 --> 07:00:59.320 align:start position:0%
Reggie was developed so uh the previous
 
07:01:02.110 --> 07:01:02.120 align:start position:0%
speakers comment about why we even try
 
07:01:03.750 --> 07:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
we should be trying but let me just take
 
07:01:06.510 --> 07:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
a step back um New Hampshire is a import
 
07:01:09.430 --> 07:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
of Transportation fuels from overseas
 
07:01:11.388 --> 07:01:11.398 align:start position:0%
and from domestic producers in other
 
07:01:13.030 --> 07:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
parts of the United States and as such
 
07:01:15.628 --> 07:01:15.638 align:start position:0%
as engaged in Regional and national uh
 
07:01:18.670 --> 07:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
fuel markets and uh as New England
 
07:01:20.628 --> 07:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
earned from the regional greenhouse gas
 
07:01:22.510 --> 07:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
initiative any Regional program such as
 
07:01:24.868 --> 07:01:24.878 align:start position:0%
Reggie or a low carbon fuel standard
 
07:01:26.628 --> 07:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
will likely significantly affect the
 
07:01:28.750 --> 07:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
price characteristics and availability
 
07:01:31.310 --> 07:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
of Transportation fuels imported into
 
07:01:34.110 --> 07:01:34.120 align:start position:0%
New England whether we participate or
 
07:01:37.708 --> 07:01:37.718 align:start position:0%
not now enacting House Bill 373 which
 
07:01:39.788 --> 07:01:39.798 align:start position:0%
would prohibit the dees from
 
07:01:41.070 --> 07:01:41.080 align:start position:0%
participating in the development of a
 
07:01:42.590 --> 07:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
low carbon fuel standard would likely
 
07:01:45.468 --> 07:01:45.478 align:start position:0%
leave New Hampshire with no ability to
 
07:01:47.070 --> 07:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
influence the development of regional
 
07:01:49.230 --> 07:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
low carbon fuel standard but for all
 
07:01:51.150 --> 07:01:51.160 align:start position:0%
incense and purposes subject to all of
 
07:01:53.510 --> 07:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
the impacts of such a program and none
 
07:01:55.708 --> 07:01:55.718 align:start position:0%
of its potential economic benefits
 
07:01:57.310 --> 07:01:57.320 align:start position:0%
surely not a good outcome for New
 
07:01:59.468 --> 07:01:59.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and its energy consuming
 
07:02:02.230 --> 07:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
citizens let New Hampshire Dees uh take
 
07:02:05.430 --> 07:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
a seat at the table thank you appreciate
 
07:02:08.310 --> 07:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
the time uh to provide this uh testimony
 
07:02:10.110 --> 07:02:10.120 align:start position:0%
I've also provided written testimony
 
07:02:12.270 --> 07:02:12.280 align:start position:0%
which is in the record now thank
 
07:02:15.070 --> 07:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr kwasnik any questions
 
07:02:15.990 --> 07:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
for Mr
 
07:02:18.590 --> 07:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
kwasnik seeing none we'll move to our
 
07:02:21.230 --> 07:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
final speaker of the day and remind
 
07:02:23.590 --> 07:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
everyone that it is now 3
 
07:02:26.910 --> 07:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
5:00 and uh there are committee staffers
 
07:02:28.350 --> 07:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
in the building here who would like to
 
07:02:32.548 --> 07:02:32.558 align:start position:0%
go home so with that I'd like to um
 
07:02:36.948 --> 07:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
authorize uh Mr John Gage to make brief
 
07:02:40.590 --> 07:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
comments you have two minutes Mr Gage hi
 
07:02:43.270 --> 07:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you well I'm for Prosperity too I
 
07:02:45.388 --> 07:02:45.398 align:start position:0%
disagree with uh the state coordinator
 
07:02:47.070 --> 07:02:47.080 align:start position:0%
of Americans Prosperity though and how
 
07:02:49.750 --> 07:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
to get there and um I'm also a New
 
07:02:52.670 --> 07:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayer um
 
07:02:56.230 --> 07:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
and my ma my biggest concern for my
 
07:02:59.708 --> 07:02:59.718 align:start position:0%
family's future is carbon pollution and
 
07:03:01.868 --> 07:03:01.878 align:start position:0%
I think that our Environmental Group in
 
07:03:03.830 --> 07:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the dees should be
 
07:03:07.310 --> 07:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
involved in state Regional and federal
 
07:03:11.190 --> 07:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
discussions um on how to reduce carbon
 
07:03:15.628 --> 07:03:15.638 align:start position:0%
pollution um I don't see TCI anywhere in
 
07:03:17.310 --> 07:03:17.320 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
07:03:22.110 --> 07:03:22.120 align:start position:0%
or uh the um amendment that what it's
 
07:03:25.110 --> 07:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
amending um what I read is that this
 
07:03:27.670 --> 07:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
affects all low carbon emission
 
07:03:29.830 --> 07:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
standards at the state Regional and
 
07:03:32.510 --> 07:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
federal level um basically putting
 
07:03:33.990 --> 07:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
blinders on our
 
07:03:37.350 --> 07:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
Dees in any discussions about reducing
 
07:03:40.548 --> 07:03:40.558 align:start position:0%
carbon pollution um that are going on at
 
07:03:44.830 --> 07:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
any level um I don't you know this just
 
07:03:47.868 --> 07:03:47.878 align:start position:0%
seems like we're trying to stay ignorant
 
07:03:50.910 --> 07:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
and removing ourselves from discussions
 
07:03:53.468 --> 07:03:53.478 align:start position:0%
that um um our legislators should be
 
07:03:55.590 --> 07:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
aware of we should be paying attention
 
07:03:57.830 --> 07:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
to what's going on at the regional and
 
07:03:59.990 --> 07:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
federal level and we should have the
 
07:04:03.388 --> 07:04:03.398 align:start position:0%
experts in our state um participating in
 
07:04:05.868 --> 07:04:05.878 align:start position:0%
discussions about reducing carbon so
 
07:04:08.628 --> 07:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
that we can make good decisions at our
 
07:04:11.150 --> 07:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
at our state level
 
07:04:14.868 --> 07:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
um you know it the the taxpayers
 
07:04:18.030 --> 07:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
association fellow um basically said we
 
07:04:20.830 --> 07:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
should just free ride we're a small part
 
07:04:23.388 --> 07:04:23.398 align:start position:0%
of the problem so why should we worry
 
07:04:26.270 --> 07:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
about our pollution 30 seconds it's
 
07:04:27.948 --> 07:04:27.958 align:start position:0%
everybody else's pollution that's the
 
07:04:31.270 --> 07:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
problem well when everybody thinks the
 
07:04:35.110 --> 07:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
same way nobody solves the problem um I
 
07:04:37.548 --> 07:04:37.558 align:start position:0%
believe the correct way to address the
 
07:04:39.310 --> 07:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
problem at the global level is to put a
 
07:04:41.070 --> 07:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
price on it on carbon at the federal
 
07:04:42.708 --> 07:04:42.718 align:start position:0%
level and return the money back to
 
07:04:44.750 --> 07:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
households um and we can use border
 
07:04:46.310 --> 07:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
adjustments to push that carbon price
 
07:04:48.190 --> 07:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
around the world what we can do at the
 
07:04:51.310 --> 07:04:51.320 align:start position:0%
state level is to prepare for a price on
 
07:04:51.320 --> 07:04:52.430 align:start position:0%
state level is to prepare for a price on
carbon

07:04:52.430 --> 07:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
carbon
 
07:04:54.270 --> 07:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
um many groups say will have a price of
 
07:04:58.430 --> 07:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
$100 per Time by 2030 time is
 
07:05:01.628 --> 07:05:01.638 align:start position:0%

I just wanted to add a little bit of
 
07:07:23.708 --> 07:07:23.718 align:start position:0%
information about the capacity factor
 
07:07:26.468 --> 07:07:26.478 align:start position:0%
for solar I calculated for my solar for
 
07:07:28.670 --> 07:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
one year I got
 
07:07:31.830 --> 07:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
13.7% capacity factor which is pretty
 
07:07:34.230 --> 07:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
close to what we were talking about and
 
07:07:37.830 --> 07:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
