committee and other committees don't
 
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
and i can only tell you anecdotally what
 
00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 align:start position:0%
i understand it to be
 
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
the uh it was when i was here 16 years
 
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
ago that's what i was taught
 
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
that's what we did and it was more of a
 
00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
ode to
 
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 align:start position:0%

they did
 
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know why other committees don't
 
00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 align:start position:0%
do that i'm just keeping on the
 
00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:27.830 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
for the record i am representative
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
michael cahill representing the towns of
 
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
newfields and newmarket
 
00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:46.959 align:start position:0%
in rockingham 17.
 
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
we're back discussing hb 501
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
a number of amendments some of them kind
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
of last minute but this is to make it a
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
easier for the institutions to comply
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
what we're asking for
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
them to do is to provide uh annual
 
00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:03.350 align:start position:0%
them to do is to provide uh annual
reports

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
reports
 
00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
uh on the salaries of not only their
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
full-time faculty but the adjuncts
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
and this is because that information
 
00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
hasn't been available
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
and we seem to have a problem with uh
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
with uh salary with low wages for for
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
uh adjuncts and some and to some extent
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
the overuse of adjunct
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
faculty this really
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
i think this information will help with
 
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:29.670 align:start position:0%
i think this information will help with
uh

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
people deciding whether they should
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
pursue that uh avenue
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
if it's a valid uh uh even as a side
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
hustle you might do better
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
delivering for doordash but if this is
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
your calling and you want to be an
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
educator you've got the
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
degrees perhaps you should be earning
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
more money uh
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
if this isn't the way to go then you
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
have to look elsewhere
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
but that's that's sort of the purpose to
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
have the information and this is the off
 
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.389 align:start position:0%
have the information and this is the off
chance

00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
chance
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
that you know those of us in the
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
legislature might recognize that there's
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
a little problem
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
funding education in new hampshire and
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
we might actually find a way to improve
 
00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:04.629 align:start position:0%
we might actually find a way to improve
that

00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
and every bit of information we have is
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
helpful i think
 
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.829 align:start position:0%
 
2021-0614

00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
2021-0614
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
h and the the change here is that it
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
no longer asks for 75 of the
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
compensation of the full-time faculty
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
it only asks for the annual reports on a
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
calendar basis
 
00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519 align:start position:0%
and to be uh no later than march 1st
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
which is coinciding with
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
the deadline for w-2 payments so the
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
information is going to be similar
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh not a terrible burden for the
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
colleges but we think this will be
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative cahill what is the
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
your amendment 0297h and 0614h
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
and why are we dispensing with o2 970
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
the the thing that's different here is
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
that in
 
00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
in the prior amendment we had asked for
 
00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:10.790 align:start position:0%
in the prior amendment we had asked for
the

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
annual the reports by january 1st that's
 
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.310 align:start position:0%
annual the reports by january 1st that's
it

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
and and this will move us to move it to
 
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
march 1st which will be in
 
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
in alignment with the w-2
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you you did say that and i just
 
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
needed to see it visually you understand
 
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
um does that conclude your testimony
 
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
it does all right well thank you very
 
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
much do we have any questions for
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
representative cato in the lob
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
if we have any questions for
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%

uh i have a few questions for you
 
00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
representative yes sir
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that all of this
 
00:14:00.399 --> 00:14:01.750 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that all of this
information

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
is available to the public now was that
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
information inaccurate that was given to
 
00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:07.829 align:start position:0%
information inaccurate that was given to
me

00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:07.839 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that neither of the
 
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.189 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that neither of the
institutions

00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
reports the adjunct only they only do
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
the full-time if if
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
they i mean unh does full time but not
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
the not the adjunct and i don't know of
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
any reporting done
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
by the community college system
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
i'll add that ms reed was going to sign
 
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
on today and testify i don't see her
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative i'll go back to the
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
original uh concern
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
you have members of the adjunct
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
professors have a union
 
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
the union has been unsuccessful in
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
negotiating terms that they feel are
 
00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.590 align:start position:0%
negotiating terms that they feel are
appropriate

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
yet you want the legislation legislature
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
to provide information
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
um an effort to make a case
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh to whom or
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
the um uh the their negotiating team
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
i i believe this information i mean they
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
their negotiating team already knows
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
what they're what they're being paid
 
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
so this is really for the benefit of the
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
general public
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%

seeing no hands either physically or
 
00:15:38.839 --> 00:15:40.389 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands either physically or
electronically

00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%

cahill for
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
for sharing the amendment and kind of
 
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
being open on on what you're trying to
 
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:40.389 align:start position:0%
being open on on what you're trying to
do

00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
uh with with this change um so the
 
00:16:45.749 --> 00:16:45.759 align:start position:0%
university system uh does continue to
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
oppose this amendment largely because
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
you know we're unsure
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
of the objective and to the extent we've
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
heard the objective this morning we
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
don't believe that this new
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
administrative requirement is really
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
going to provide the kind of information
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
the sponsors and the supporters of the
 
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
original bill might be seeking
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
uh as a public nonprofit state chartered
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
entity usnh
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
is committed to transparent operations
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
for years we have published annual
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
salary books
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
you can find old editions of those books
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
going back decades
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
in uh the library at unh and for at
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
least the last five years and then going
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
forward they have all been
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
available online there's no requirement
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
that we do that in statute
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
we just think it's good practice we
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
report in a way that is similar to the
 
00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:26.309 align:start position:0%
report in a way that is similar to the
state

00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
which is a point in time snapshot of
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
base salaries
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
for all benefit employees as of the date
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
of the report and for us we report
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh on the last day of the fiscal year so
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
june 30th i believe
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
um for years this has generally
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
satisfied the state and the public
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
interest and understanding employee
 
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
salaries and
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
i'll just note that last uh back and
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
forth uh
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
the sponsor is correct we look like as
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
he said we report full-time
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
benefited salaries we do not report
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
adjunct salaries and we'll get to
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
kind of some of the reasons why in a
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
moment however if there's a right to no
 
00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
request we are a public entity we would
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
respond to that right to no request as
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
in the past um the salary book isn't
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
perfect again it does only
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh it does only show full-time benefited
 
00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.270 align:start position:0%
uh it does only show full-time benefited
salary

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
salary
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
um but based on this led based on the
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
prior legislation this amendment we are
 
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
having some conversations about
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
what we could do to perhaps improve some
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
transparency improve
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
some reporting to try and get at some of
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
the concerns perhaps adding an addendum
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
to that list
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
that provides annual compensation for
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
all teaching staff
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
the the sponsor noted w-2 wages
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
i think the community college system
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
does report like that i'll let shannon
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
speak to that in a minute
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
we use base salary
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
again based on what the state does we
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
think there's also some
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
kind of perhaps misrepresentation in w-2
 
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:45.750 align:start position:0%
kind of perhaps misrepresentation in w-2
data

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
as it shows wages are impacted by
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
pre-tax deductions right medical
 
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
insurance retirement etc
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
and i think base salary says this is the
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
salary for a position
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
as opposed to w-2 obviously as this is
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
what jane or john doe made in
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
a year that said as we begin trying to
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
add more
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
detail to these long-running reports we
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
worry that this information could
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
continue to create
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
more confusion for example uh reporting
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily include the number
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
of classes taught
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
by any uh adjunct faculty member so to
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
the extent that you're trying to get at
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
what a faculty member is making in wages
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
or not at least as put out in the
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
legislation we're not saying this
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
faculty member taught
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
three classes and as a result was paid
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
this we're just saying this faculty
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
member was paid this so you don't know
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
if it's for one
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
three more classes um you also don't
 
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
know if that faculty member
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
is doing other work at either the
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
university system so we have a number of
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
employees who may be working part-time
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
in a range of other
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
job functions across campus that would
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
all be rolled into a
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
w-2 wage reporting so again wouldn't
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
show you what they're making as an
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
adjunct faculty member
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
similar there's faculty that might teach
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
one class the university system one
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
class the community college system one
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
class at a private institution in the
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
state so again not a great view of
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
of what they're actually making in the
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
course of a year um
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
it i mean it's to the degree that this
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
and this sort of gets to
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
to representative cahill's point i mean
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
we've said from the start of this
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
conversation that
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
you know adjunct faculty work is
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
important it's critical to bring these
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
additional skills and views into the
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
university system
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
um to help students understand kind of
 
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
the real world uh experience that these
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
faculty members are bringing
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
that's we never intend however for it to
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
be a full-time position
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
there are there are there are processes
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
and pathways for
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
for faculty to take if they do want to
 
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
teach full-time so to the
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
extent that somebody's trying to make
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
this a full-time job we understand that
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
we appreciate it
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
um but they they are told obviously as
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
they start this position what the the
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
pay for a class is
 
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
what to pay for any number of classes
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
based on experience based on the
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
teaching load etc
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
um and then send up to that that
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
individual to make the decision if it
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
if it's the the path they want to choose
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
so again we're committed to transparent
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
operations um
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
we appreciate that there is an interest
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
in better understanding this pay
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
information and would welcome a
 
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.789 align:start position:0%
information and would welcome a
conversation

00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
and look forward to working with
 
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative cahill with some of the
 
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:08.559 align:start position:0%
folks that i think he worked with on
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
developing this legislation
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
to figure out perhaps a right way to do
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
this that makes it manageable and it
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
makes it useful information for
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
for folks to understand but for the time
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
being we would respectfully ask this
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee to give us the opportunity to
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
outside of the legislative or statutory
 
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:24.950 align:start position:0%
outside of the legislative or statutory
process

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
as we have for a number of years and
 
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
finally just from a
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
statutory perspective the university
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
system and the community college system
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
are not
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
governed by the state higher education
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
commission to my
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
understanding we do not have any other
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements to the higher ed
 
00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.590 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements to the higher ed
commission

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
in either of our rsas i would want
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
shannon i guess to confirm that on the
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
community college side i can confirm it
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
from the the usnh side
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
um so if the committee was interested in
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
moving forward with an amendment
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
um that put some sort of requirement in
 
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
statute we'd respectfully ask for
 
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
a further conversation on maybe the
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
right way to set up that reporting
 
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.470 align:start position:0%
right way to set up that reporting
requirement

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
so that's that i'd be happy to take any
 
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.430 align:start position:0%
so that's that i'd be happy to take any
questions

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
thank you your customer you have any
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
i don't see any questions online
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i keep getting kicked off

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
for the community college system of new
 
00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.430 align:start position:0%
for the community college system of new
hampshire

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to thank the sponsor for
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
sharing his amendment with us this
 
00:23:27.039 --> 00:23:27.830 align:start position:0%
sharing his amendment with us this
morning

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
i'll do my best to address that that
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
amendment which i think doesn't differ
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
too much from the original amendment uh
 
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.430 align:start position:0%
too much from the original amendment uh
so

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
similar to mr conan's testimony there
 
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
are a couple different ways of reporting
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
wages and each has its
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
um i guess nuances neither is neither is
 
00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.830 align:start position:0%
um i guess nuances neither is neither is
perfect

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
ccsnh when we are asked to report on
 
00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.950 align:start position:0%
ccsnh when we are asked to report on
wages

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
wages
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
we we certainly we do so readily we
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
don't require a right to know request or
 
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:56.710 align:start position:0%
don't require a right to know request or
anything

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
um and what we typically report is the
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
w-2 wage
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
as mr cronin noted though the w-2 wage
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
misinform as it can provide clarity
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
because it does have everything bundled
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
into one
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
number so i won't repeat the examples
 
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.390 align:start position:0%
number so i won't repeat the examples
that

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
that tom provided but it's it's it's
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
similar for us
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
um for the community college system it
 
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't show
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
the variety of of roles that any any
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
employee might take on it would
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
basically show
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
name primary job title
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
wages earned during that calendar year
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
so it really doesn't i think get to the
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
um what i think would best meet the
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
intent of the
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the amendment uh would be we could
 
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:48.710 align:start position:0%
of the amendment uh would be we could
report

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
the salary schedule for adjunct
 
00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.390 align:start position:0%
the salary schedule for adjunct
instructors

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
instructors
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
which is the the pay that's approved
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
in the collective writing agreements and
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
contained in every you know every
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
successive cba
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
which would show not linked to a
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
particular name but it would show
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
what the pay range is for somebody
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
teaching a course
 
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
at a community college as an adjunct
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
faculty member
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
and it would it would kind of indicate
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
um the differential if it's a lab course
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
versus a non-lab course
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
so that would give a clear picture of
 
00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:20.710 align:start position:0%
so that would give a clear picture of
what

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
an adjunct appointment
 
00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
pays for a given um a given course
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
um and similarly we could report the
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
salary schedules
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
that are in place for full-time faculty
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
we have a number of those because we
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
have full-time faculty on 10-month
 
00:25:38.159 --> 00:25:38.870 align:start position:0%
have full-time faculty on 10-month
contracts

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
11-month contracts and 12-month
 
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.149 align:start position:0%
11-month contracts and 12-month
contracts

00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
so we have a salary schedule for each um
 
00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:45.430 align:start position:0%
so we have a salary schedule for each um
and

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
again these are things that are
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
negotiated in the cpas and published
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
within cbas
 
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
but if transparency in some other venue
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
is what is
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
sought to my mind those are the most
 
00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
accurate um the most
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
that's the most accurate information we
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
could provide um the w-2 again
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
very imperfect and could be misconstrued
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
um and the the type of report that usnh
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
provides every year
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
on its public website um captures
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
salaried positions but wouldn't capture
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
those adjunct jobs which really aren't
 
00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.390 align:start position:0%
those adjunct jobs which really aren't
aren't

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
paid based on an annual salary so i hope
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
that makes sense and i'll try to clarify
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
if there's if there's any questions it
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
looks like the language the amendment
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
would have us report basically name and
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
the wages aren't connected with that
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
name in any given year
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily you know the intent
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
of the bill and
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps the sponsor can decide that for
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
himself if he if he thinks that that
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
would or wouldn't meet the intent um we
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
have committed
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
to the bill sponsor that going forward
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
we will show
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
on our job recruitment postings for any
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
adjunct position
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
that we will post the pay range this is
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
something we hadn't done
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
routinely before i don't really know why
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to do it but
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
but we we will we'll do that as a
 
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:03.830 align:start position:0%
but we we will we'll do that as a
practice

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
from now on so any adjunct position
 
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
that's posted for recruitment on our
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
website will include
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
the pay range and that way applicants
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
will know what level of compensation
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
they can expect
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
before they decide whether or not to
 
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.830 align:start position:0%
before they decide whether or not to
apply

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
um i i guess that's
 
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559 align:start position:0%
well i would also um just confirm what
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
mr cronin shared with you
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
the community college system does not is
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
not an entity that reports up to the
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
higher education commission
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
as a as a an organization established in
 
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.630 align:start position:0%
as a as a an organization established in
statute

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
we're accepted from that so we have a
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
kind of a a whole other kind of universe
 
00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:41.510 align:start position:0%
kind of a a whole other kind of universe
of

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
of public accountability but it's not
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
through the higher ed commission so this
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
anomalous if we were to report salaries
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
in that way
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
to to that to that commission so i'll
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
stop and if you have any questions i
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
you have any questions here in the llb
 
00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:00.230 align:start position:0%
you have any questions here in the llb
for

for
 
00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:15.029 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
i'm still able unable to connect with my
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
computer folks that's why i'm using my
 
00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
temple phone so i'm
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
sorry uh misread i have a couple
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
questions um
 
00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately i'm gonna any of my
 
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
committee members who don't like what
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna say can stop me in any time
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
because this really isn't a question but
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
you made an offer
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
in this in your testing provide
 
00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:39.350 align:start position:0%
in this in your testing provide
information

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.389 align:start position:0%
information
um

00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
i would rather not put a law in place
 
00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
requiring things when we have a
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
situation here apparently
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
where we have a dispute
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
are you will you confirm that you will
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
provide this information
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
for the next few years uh as you
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
suggested um
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
get requested if you're talking about
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
if you're talking about the wage
 
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.190 align:start position:0%
if you're talking about the wage
schedules

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
schedules
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
we already do to our workforce insofar
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
as they're contained in
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
cbas um we can certainly
 
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
find a i'm certain we can find a way to
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
put that information
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
in a public facing way if it's not
 
00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.950 align:start position:0%
in a public facing way if it's not
already

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
that would be our salary schedules um
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
to rock the boat
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%

00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
said it really wasn't needed and
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
they'd like to leave it up to the
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
individual employers and
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
agreements with their employees and
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
they're just too many myriad agreements
 
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
among the
 
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
thousands of businesses out there we
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
don't need to be sticking our government
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
nodes in this particular aspect of it
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
it's too hard to do one size fits all
 
00:33:15.039 --> 00:33:16.149 align:start position:0%
it's too hard to do one size fits all
legislation

00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
and therefore this uh this bill is
 
00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:19.990 align:start position:0%
and therefore this uh this bill is
unneeded

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
unneeded
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%

00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
representative cahill yes mr chair it's
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh i i do have an amendment that
 
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
softens a great deal in the glove
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
for those who those concerns that were
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
raised previously
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
and i want to draw your attention that
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
there are in fact many
 
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
people who are doing everything they can
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
to be good employees many employers who
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
are also doing
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
the right thing and it is a matter of
 
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
we we don't pass laws for people who are
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
doing the right things we try to aim
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
to get more people to do the right
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
things and
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
this issue is is really an important
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
issue for many of our constituents
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
those who work in businesses and
 
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
go along going following the procedure
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
working their notice
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh doing well and moving on and there is
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
really no reason
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
why all when they move on they should
 
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
not take whatever they
 
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:39.919 align:start position:0%
was given to them as compensation and
 
00:34:39.919 --> 00:34:40.389 align:start position:0%
was given to them as compensation and
then

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
forfeit it uh simply because the
 
00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:43.750 align:start position:0%
forfeit it uh simply because the
employer

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
employer
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
has this in this policy i'll point out
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
that when you when you take a vacation
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
and it comes out of your
 
00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:52.079 align:start position:0%
whatever it is pto or vacation your
 
00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
taxes are taken out
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
your health cut your health care
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
deductions are taken out because those
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
are wages
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
and when you uh when you leave
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
employment if you if you have vacation
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
pay and you should you should file for
 
00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.910 align:start position:0%
pay and you should you should file for
unemployment

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
then unemployment is those checks are
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
delayed until you have exhausted
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
the money that was paid to you and for
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
your vacation payout though
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
in every sense of the word vacation
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
hours are compensation it is part of
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
part of what you're given and should not
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
be retracted uh
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
just because you've uh made a different
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
arrangement and are leaving the company
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
particularly that you're meeting
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
in good standing with no no bad feelings
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
or anything like this there is no
 
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.670 align:start position:0%
or anything like this there is no
justification

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
justification
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
for an employer to retain what you have
 
00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:43.510 align:start position:0%
for an employer to retain what you have
earned

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
does that complete your testimony
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
representative or your your comments
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
can you see anyone else guys i'm sorry
 
00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
i'm investing around
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
this i'm sorry representative smith
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
you're recognized
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
thank you um if you'll recall from the
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
testimony on this
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
this is a problem with our our labor
 
00:36:09.839 --> 00:36:10.790 align:start position:0%
this is a problem with our our labor
department

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
this is something that they see quite
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
often that someone who has earned
 
00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
that money per the agreement that they
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
have with the company
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
and the money is being withheld from
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
them when they leave
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
even in good standing i think that it's
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely essential that we
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
lighten the load of the labor department
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that people are paid what
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
they've earned
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
and this has nothing to do with the
 
00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:38.079 align:start position:0%
government intruding in something it's
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
got to do with
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
the businesses following through with
 
00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:42.870 align:start position:0%
the businesses following through with
their

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
promise that's all i needed to say thank
 
00:36:45.839 --> 00:36:48.470 align:start position:0%
promise that's all i needed to say thank
you

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative smith
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that this only
 
00:37:03.599 --> 00:37:05.030 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that this only
applies

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
applies
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
to employers who have made a policy
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
that says that vacation would be
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh granted uh you know
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
one uh for example uh one month
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
at a time if if uh
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
they set up a policy where uh
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
vacation is earned uh on
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
on a basis of of one one month at a time
 
00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:34.150 align:start position:0%
on a basis of of one one month at a time
or

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
or or whatever uh if an employer
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
does not want to have a policy like that
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
they're free to do that and this law
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
would not apply to them so i don't know
 
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
if i'm being clear
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
but this is only to to employers that
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
have a policy
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
that vacation is is earned uh
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
you know at a at a certain sequence of
 
00:37:58.880 --> 00:37:59.829 align:start position:0%
you know at a at a certain sequence of
time

00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
so uh it's no different than when a
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
employer makes a policy of the employee
 
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
you'll be
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
paid 10 bucks an hour and then all of a
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
sudden he pays
 
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
the employee eight bucks an hour
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
then of course the labor department
 
00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
would enforce that
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
in this case the labor department should
 
00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.349 align:start position:0%
in this case the labor department should
enforce

00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
the fact that the employer has set up a
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
certain policy
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
if they don't want that policy they
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
don't have to have to make that policy
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
and and so that's that's my uh
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative to me i see no
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
online okay representative sullivan
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
online and then representative uh vice
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
chairman uh
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
seaworth representative sullivan thank
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to point out a couple of
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
things first of all
 
00:38:59.430 --> 00:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
i know we're not looking at an amendment
 
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
because of the emotion we're uh
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with but representative cahill
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
did bend over backwards to try to
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
address the issues that people have
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
raised with regard to this
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
and um i would have hoped that we would
 
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
have had a chance to look at that
 
00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:18.470 align:start position:0%
have had a chance to look at that
amendment

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
um in addition um one of the issues that
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
comes up
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
with lost vacation time is layoffs
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
employees often have no idea if or when
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
they're going to be laid off
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
therefore they don't have the ability to
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
schedule vacation
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
prior to that layoff so they're notified
 
00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.670 align:start position:0%
prior to that layoff so they're notified
on

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
right a given friday that um they're
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
being laid off
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
and uh the vacation time that they've
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
got on the books that they were going to
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
take next month or in two months or at
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
some point in the future just vaporizes
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's one of the primary issues i
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
believe representative cahill was trying
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
to address here
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
um so um i would uh ask that we vote
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
down the uh
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh the motion of itl so that we can
 
00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
have another motion and look at the
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative seaworth
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
i have been involved with this bill in
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
attempts to pass it in previous sessions
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
and something that strikes me today is
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
bothered me last term when it was passed
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
and i voted against it last term for
 
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
this reason
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
if you talk to different people which i
 
00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:44.550 align:start position:0%
if you talk to different people which i
have

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
different members of the committee if
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
you listen to some of the statements
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
made today different people have
 
00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:51.990 align:start position:0%
made today different people have
different

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
opinions of who this law would affect
 
00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.069 align:start position:0%
opinions of who this law would affect
and

00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
when um specifically
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
that and well i don't want to put words
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
into anyone's mouth because
 
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
different people have different ideas
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
they make statements and i don't want to
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
try to read into that
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
i will say that during the public
 
00:41:15.359 --> 00:41:19.030 align:start position:0%
i will say that during the public
testimony

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
i asked some questions of the labor
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
department based on my reading of the
 
00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.030 align:start position:0%
department based on my reading of the
bill

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
to all employers and particularly ones
 
00:41:32.079 --> 00:41:32.470 align:start position:0%
to all employers and particularly ones
that

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
don't have a policy in effect that do
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
offer vacation
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
um but don't have certain things in
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
their policy
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
and so i asked the labor department
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that
 
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%
if there is a written policy and a
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
worker comes to them and says
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
my employer violated this policy
 
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
they should have done what's written
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
here the labor department confirmed that
 
00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:58.870 align:start position:0%
here the labor department confirmed that
yes

00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
in fact they do have the authority to
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
enforce the policy
 
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
that is in place for that employer
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
so it concerns me when i hear people
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
making interpretations of this bill that
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
differ from my plain reading of it
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
that differ from the explanation that i
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
heard from the department of labor
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
and again i'm going to vote against this
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
because i i don't think this does
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
what some of the supporters are saying
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
it was written to do thank you
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
any other comments representative of
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
turcotte you're recognized to speak
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh just a couple
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
of brief comments
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
one of the questions i asked at the
 
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
hearing of a couple of the presenters
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
who were representing industry
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
groups were are you aware of any
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
companies that you represent
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
that offer vacation days that do not
 
00:43:00.309 --> 00:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
inform their employees
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
and the answer to that was no we also
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
learned that the majority of companies
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
in in new hampshire
 
00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
already have a system in place
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
those who offer vacation time so that's
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
not an issue
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
the number of complaints was actually
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
according to commissioner ogden that
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
vice missionary was very extremely low
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
and lastly um once again i know it
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
becomes it starts to become sound like a
 
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
broken record but
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
there's an employee and an employee
 
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.190 align:start position:0%
there's an employee and an employee
employer

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
employer
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
relationship that's cemented when the
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
the two
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
individuals get together when the
 
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
employer offers the employee
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh the position um
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
what they agreed to at that time whether
 
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's through a
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
union contract or an individual
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
agreement that should uh that should be
 
00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.470 align:start position:0%
agreement that should uh that should be
the

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
way those two handle their business
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
relationship so i too will be voting
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
in favor of the ital also i will make
 
00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:09.750 align:start position:0%
in favor of the ital also i will make
another

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
quick comment and the idea of
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
at this point in time receiving an
 
00:44:15.599 --> 00:44:16.550 align:start position:0%
at this point in time receiving an
amendment

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
i i would suggest
 
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
to individuals who like to make
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
commitments that
 
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
in the future if you could do it well
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
well in advance of uh a hearing
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
that that would be very beneficial to me
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
thank you i am going to uh defend mr
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
cahill here on that last comment
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%

possible
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
given the circumstances we have with
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
trying to get things through legislative

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
you know um this is a very difficult
 
00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:40.790 align:start position:0%
you know um this is a very difficult
situation

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
bill for me because there are
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
some circumstances where
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
some employers have done some things
 
00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.030 align:start position:0%
some employers have done some things
that

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
you know to use a vernacular of my
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
children not cool
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
um the we had a situation and we were
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
told by representative ogden
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
that um at the beginning of the year an
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
employee gave a yellow piece of paper
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
to each one of their employees and on
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
the yellow piece of paper it had how
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
many hours vacation you have
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
or how many days and you had to keep
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
that piece of paper and every time you
 
00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:18.550 align:start position:0%
that piece of paper and every time you
wanted

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
some time off you had to bring that
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
and they'd write on it if you lost a
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
piece of paper well
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
no more vacation well that's ludicrous
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
and that was addressed
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
for the department of labor and they
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
stopped that i'm aware of certain
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances where one company buys out
 
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.670 align:start position:0%
circumstances where one company buys out
another

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
and one company has a lesser
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
vacation time mechanism than the company
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
they bought out
 
00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
um so some employees that well i thought
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
i had three weeks earned vacation day
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
because today because i've been here for
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
five years now all of a sudden some of
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
the company comes in and says nope we
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
only have two
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
so um there are some circumstances um
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
where the legislature could shore some
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
things up
 
00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
the the problem i have with this this
 
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
bill originally was
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
this concept that um which i know the
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
amendments did take out
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh if you have if you've read these
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
amendments representative cahill
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
made a significant effort to take some
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
concerns that were offered um
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
during the testimony and make changes to
 
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
them um
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
you know one being you know doesn't
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
matter if you what you do you beat up
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
the boss burn the place down you're
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
still going to get your vacation pay
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
um so obviously those were what those
 
00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:37.910 align:start position:0%
um so obviously those were what those
were

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
those are my words see this this bill
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
didn't say that you all know what i
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know that any any kind of behavior
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
you would still
 
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
get to have your um your earned vacation
 
00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:48.549 align:start position:0%
get to have your um your earned vacation
pay

00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:48.559 align:start position:0%
pay
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
this is a lot different than the concept
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
that we have which if we haven't come
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
across this yet for some of you
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
newer folks we have a really strict
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
belief in the state of new hampshire
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
that tips are the employees pay
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
no ifs ands or buts about it and has
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
never been breached
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that the the department of
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
labor feels the same way
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
about vacation time the problem is
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
vacation time is no longer really
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
vacation time
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
um many employers give you a block of
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
time it can be used for vacation
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
sick personal time or whatever so
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
what do we how does this affect those
 
00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.670 align:start position:0%
what do we how does this affect those
companies

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
that do not have vacation time per se
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh and if you create something that's
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
too restrictive on vacation pay people
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
say well
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to get around it by saying
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
it's not vacation pay anymore it's just
 
00:48:38.079 --> 00:48:39.190 align:start position:0%
it's not vacation pay anymore it's just
this

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
there are a few things that need to be
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
adjusted and unfortunately
 
00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
that's why we have a department of labor
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
and we have fines associated with these
 
00:48:49.359 --> 00:48:50.470 align:start position:0%
and we have fines associated with these
things

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh i would rather representative cahill
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
try to come back with a piece of
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
legislation that talks really about
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
um different time
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
because again this would only affect
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
some it would
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
not affect many others that don't
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
adhere to quote-unquote vacation time
 
00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:13.349 align:start position:0%
adhere to quote-unquote vacation time
so

00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
if you support it as is that's what
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative cahill has outdone
 
00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:19.839 align:start position:0%
himself trying to
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
get something palatable for the
 
00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:21.410 align:start position:0%
get something palatable for the
committee

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:24.230 align:start position:0%
committee
[Music]

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte yeah thank you
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
mr chairman just to be clear
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
when i mentioned the timing of
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
amendments i was under the impression
 
00:49:31.599 --> 00:49:32.470 align:start position:0%
amendments i was under the impression
from

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative cahill and
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
welsh just mentioned that representative
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
sullivan mentioned about
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
taking on another amendment i was
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
assuming there was
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
another amendment coming on top of
 
00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:48.559 align:start position:0%
previous amendments
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
i thought he was going to introduce yet
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
another one that was my impression so
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
just to clear things up okay i
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
any other comments from the olympia
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
comments from online representative
 
00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:05.270 align:start position:0%
comments from online representative
cahill

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
cahill
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i do appreciate
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know your comments and
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
understanding of the issue uh i'd like
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
to just point out that you know what
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
the companies that do pto and say it's
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
all one all one thing that that has its
 
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:18.470 align:start position:0%
all one all one thing that that has its
own

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
problems when it comes to things like
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
family fed federal family leave act and
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
i think when people
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
if people they know they're given a
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
certain amount of days
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
and then if they if they take another
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
company would
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
imagine the company would keep track of
 
00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
the days so that they know that
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
if you've given them 14 days and they've
 
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
taken 16
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
you're not going to pay them for the
 
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
other two so i think that's less of an
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
issue than
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
we're concerned with and i think that
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
companies could certainly navigate that
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
and and that adjustments could be made
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
in view of however they're looking at it
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
they really know you know which which is
 
00:50:58.079 --> 00:50:59.109 align:start position:0%
they really know you know which which is
which

00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
and uh that could be worked out and fine
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
tuning on
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
within the employer policy
 
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%

i apologize um okay

00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
will it be ought to pass or ought to
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
pass the amendment since the amendment
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
was not brought forth
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
through committee i believe it has to be
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as presented i believe
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
a minority report can include a minority
 
00:54:02.319 --> 00:54:07.750 align:start position:0%
a minority report can include a minority
amendment

00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
correct i believe the motion needs to be
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative cahill
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
um ought to pass and then
 
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
um in your blurb you could mention the
 
00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.910 align:start position:0%
um in your blurb you could mention the
amendment

00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
unless someone parliamentary wise thinks
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
i'm wrong
 
00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:32.470 align:start position:0%
i'm wrong
with

00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
his motion on the floor would be odd to
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
pass with the men
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying what that is
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
well wouldn't the amendment
 
00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
go first you have to adopt the amendment
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
true but wouldn't this motion on the
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
floor be off to pass with amendment
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
no because nobody voted on the amendment
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
there has to be a vote on the amendment
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
before chairman infant time would you
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
like me to reach out to the clerk
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
and get back to what i was going to
 
00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.829 align:start position:0%
and get back to what i was going to
suggest

00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
representative christina yes please in
 
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
the meantime representative brudy you at
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
yes uh mr chairman i think if that
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
went like that um you would vote on the
 
00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839 align:start position:0%
amendment first and then the bill
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
and the amendment passed or didn't
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
whatever but i think they'd vote on the
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
amendment first
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment could become a floor
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
amendment i only think that because
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
you passed the amendment and then
 
00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.829 align:start position:0%
you passed the amendment and then
repealed

00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:32.839 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
00:55:32.839 --> 00:55:36.950 align:start position:0%
repealed
it

00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking about from the blurb
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
standpoint right now the motion on the
 
00:55:40.559 --> 00:55:41.030 align:start position:0%
standpoint right now the motion on the
blurb

00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
blurb
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
through the majority will be inexpedient
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
to legislate the minority blurb will be
 
00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:45.990 align:start position:0%
to legislate the minority blurb will be
either

00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
ought to pass or ought to pass with
 
00:55:48.079 --> 00:55:50.710 align:start position:0%
ought to pass or ought to pass with
amendments

00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
i think he can write otp in the blurb
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
and then reference in the word
 
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
he wants an amendment to it that is my
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
actual standard
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
i think we should ask the clerk because
 
00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:06.710 align:start position:0%
i think we should ask the clerk because
he

00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
it gets published encounter and that's
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
the advantage if it ever comes up
 
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
correctly you want to have the minority
 
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
amendment published in the calendar
 
00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:21.109 align:start position:0%
amendment published in the calendar
provincial

00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
yeah because it doesn't necessarily have
 
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:24.559 align:start position:0%
to be presented in front of this
 
00:56:24.559 --> 00:56:25.349 align:start position:0%
to be presented in front of this
committee

00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
so i the more i think it out i believe
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
octopass with the amendment
 
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
we've dispensed with our business on
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
this except just fine
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
finding out how the blurb is going to be
 
00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:49.829 align:start position:0%
finding out how the blurb is going to be
written

00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:49.839 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
the next piece of legislation uh we're
 
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
exact today
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
is house bill 261 recognized
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth for a motion
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
motion is out to task um see where the
 
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
second is by representative
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth you are um
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak to your motion
 
00:57:18.549 --> 00:57:18.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um this was a bill
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
that came with a lot of fireworks
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
unexpected fireworks
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
at least from my standpoint
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
because i didn't realize there was
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
anything controversial in this bill
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
it is intended to be a housekeeping bill
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
that addresses the apprenticeship
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
council established in rsa
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
and it takes what that council
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
actually does and has done
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
for well over a decade
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
and adjust the rsa to match
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
that we heard during testimony
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
that this is a request from the new
 
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of labor
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
and through them the u.s department of
 
00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:12.950 align:start position:0%
and through them the u.s department of
labor

00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
labor
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
to bring the law in line with current
 
00:58:20.829 --> 00:58:20.839 align:start position:0%
practice they testified that since
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
2007 the office of apprenticeship
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
at the u.s department of labor has
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
taken on this
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
registration and regulation of
 
00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:36.150 align:start position:0%
registration and regulation of
apprenticeships

00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
at a uniform national level
 
00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
and that assume some of the
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that when this rsa was
 
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.190 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that when this rsa was
originally

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
originally
 
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
written was delicate delegated to that
 
00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:52.150 align:start position:0%
written was delicate delegated to that
council

00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
um since that time uh
 
00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
if an organization
 
00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
goes to the council is
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
forming a new apprenticeship program the
 
00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
council will refer them
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
to the u.s department of labor program
 
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
so uh i hope everyone
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
can support the on to pass motion
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
um i i think
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
having taken the time to understand this
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
um to to hear about it in testimony and
 
00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:30.799 align:start position:0%
i know at least i
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
with the chairman spoke additionally to
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
the the department of labor
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
um in between uh to make sure
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
we understood what this does and what it
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't do
 
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
and i hope all the members of the
 
00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:46.390 align:start position:0%
and i hope all the members of the
committee

00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
have been able to satisfy themselves
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
thank you representative we have any
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
comments about the bill
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none questions online
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i just want to
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
briefly point out that uh
 
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
i think the um uh the controversy that
 
01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:18.470 align:start position:0%
i think the um uh the controversy that
uh

01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth mentions uh was
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
created by an email that we all received
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
from someone who
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh felt that this was ruining the um
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh apprenticeship program um
 
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
after the the hearing was over um i
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
think we all got an email i know i did
 
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
from that same individual saying oops um
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
never mind
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh this is this bill's just fine um
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
so um i i think the controversy was uh
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
fully unnecessary and um i
 
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative seaworth
 
01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:53.839 align:start position:0%
this is a book uh
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
bookkeeping uh type issue that we ought
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
to support
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you sullivan
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
believe it or not there was controversy
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
on the other side
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
some receipt from a
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
another trade group that felt that why
 
01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
are we giving this away
 
01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
to the feds uh why they we don't like
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
them dealing it we should deal with it
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
here ourselves not realizing that this
 
01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:20.230 align:start position:0%
here ourselves not realizing that this
has

01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
been the situation since 2007. as brian
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
outlined he and i did have a zoom
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
meeting with both the commissioner and
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner of labor
 
01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
we still do have a commission that does
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
meet they meet once a year
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
like they did prior to
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
the feds taking it over in 2007
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
not much to talk about in their meeting
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
because everything has been copacetic so
 
01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.030 align:start position:0%
because everything has been copacetic so
far

01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
far
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
the reasoning behind the the difference
 
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
between having it run at a local level
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
versus on the federal level
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
is um kind of reciprocity um you know
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
if if a group has a an apprenticeship in
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
texas and one in florida and one in new
 
01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.430 align:start position:0%
texas and one in florida and one in new
hampshire

01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
and someone in new hampshire is only
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
going to move to texas or florida
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
they want to make sure they're utilizing
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
the same standards for the
 
01:02:03.359 --> 01:02:05.510 align:start position:0%
the same standards for the
apprenticeship

01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship
 
01:02:07.109 --> 01:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
and any of you who are licensed in
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
anything know that there's a lot of
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
reciprocity in
 
01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
amongst licensed people that are
 
01:02:13.349 --> 01:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
licensed in certain industries
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
amongst many of the states and this
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
facility made that
 
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
much more easy so um
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
there were there was controversy on both
 
01:02:24.309 --> 01:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
sides someone wanted us to take it back
 
01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
not give it away how dare we give it
 
01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
away to the feds so
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
um all said and done it looks like it is
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
as advertised
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
a simple word updating of some of the
 
01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.710 align:start position:0%
a simple word updating of some of the
language

01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%

uh thank you speaker uh let's go 517 i
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
make a motion to
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
puff you're
 
01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak to your motion thank
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
we know there's a lot of things going on
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
on the federal level with potential
 
01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
changes to
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh minimum wage rates um there's a lot
 
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
of other issues
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
within this bill itself that normally
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
that would actually be itl but uh
 
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
for the time being i'm uh i think it'd
 
01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.789 align:start position:0%
for the time being i'm uh i think it'd
be

01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
in the committee's best interest to
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
retain until at least uh next year
 
01:05:33.839 --> 01:05:41.270 align:start position:0%
retain until at least uh next year
thanks

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i want to
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
start off by saying um i i think
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
what is going to happen on the federal
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
level is pretty squared away
 
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
um some of my least favorite democrats
 
01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
made that situation a little difficult
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that's going to end up
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
being the reconciliation package
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
i think that's going to be you know up
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
to states to decide
 
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
um and speaking of states
 
01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that i really wish
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
we had to answer was
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
ballot initiatives because they tend to
 
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
supersede the legislature that this
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
occasion a little disconnected and we
 
01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.029 align:start position:0%
occasion a little disconnected and we
saw

01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
saw
 
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
what i thought was a pretty effective uh
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
ballot initiative in the state of
 
01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.589 align:start position:0%
ballot initiative in the state of
florida

01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
florida
 
01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
in 2020 and i brought this up in the
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
hearing but i wanted to expand a little
 
01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:28.870 align:start position:0%
hearing but i wanted to expand a little
further

01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
um in florida in the 2020 election
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
they had a ballot initiative for a
 
01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
for a 15 an hour minimum wage prior to
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
that the minimum wage in the state of
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
florida was 8.25
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
and with 61 percent of the vote they
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
passed that ballot initiative and that
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
was a state
 
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
in 2020 that was won by president trump
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
with 51
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
of the vote uh 5.6 million votes
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
uh the minimum wage got 6.5 million
 
01:07:01.039 --> 01:07:01.910 align:start position:0%
uh the minimum wage got 6.5 million
votes

01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
votes
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
so a million more votes than
 
01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
the republican presidential candidate
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
that year meaning that there had to be
 
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
some broad bipartisan crossover in order
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
for that to be possible
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
it was so popular that it even beat
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
president obama's numbers in 2008 where
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
he got 51
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
of the vote in the state of florida and
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
minimum wage got two million more voters
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
in the state of florida than uh that
 
01:07:29.359 --> 01:07:30.069 align:start position:0%
in the state of florida than uh that
year

01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
meaning that a 15 an hour minimum wage
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
in the united states is more popular
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
than any politician that has run profits
 
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
in the last 20 years
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
in 1950 president harry truman one of my
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
political idols
 
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
doubled the minimum wage from
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
75 cents to 1.50 an hour
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
and like in truman's time there were
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
adverse feelings about raising the
 
01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
he said of his political opponents at
 
01:08:03.029 --> 01:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
the time that they believe in a minimum
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
wage the more minimum the better
 
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
in 1950 unemployment was 6.6
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
um right before in the month before that
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
minimum wage increase went to effect
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
in december 1951 the unemployment rate
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
was 3.1
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
and in december 1952 it was 2.7
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
no study that has that doesn't have a
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
predetermined bias
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
will say that the minimum wage destroys
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
the economy
 
01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
when truman doubled the minimum wage it
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
had the buying power
 
01:08:38.789 --> 01:08:38.799 align:start position:0%
of 13 an hour in 1950.
 
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
there's an argument that it'll raise the
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
cost of goods and i don't believe that's
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
the case
 
01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
because if you look at france there's a
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
minimum wage of 13
 
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
an hour and a big mac at mcdonald's
 
01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
costs 452
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
in australia the minimum wage is closer
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
to 19 an hour
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
and the big mac is 465. and the united
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
states and in new hampshire
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
the minute the minimum wage is 7.25
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
cents an hour
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
and the big mac is 479. we all got an
 
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
email the other day
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire federation of
 
01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
independent businesses
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
and one of the lines in that email said
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh we all know minimum wage wasn't meant
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
to be a living wage
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
i have no idea where this pernicious
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
idea came from
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
because the father of the minimum wage
 
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:25.759 align:start position:0%
president franklin roosevelt
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
specifically said that the minimum wage
 
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
was meant to be
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
a decent standard of living and not just
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
a bear assessments
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
because what is the point of having a
 
01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
minimum wage if folks that work it can't
 
01:09:37.839 --> 01:09:39.030 align:start position:0%
minimum wage if folks that work it can't
survive

01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
survive
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
roosevelt like truman knew that you
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
didn't water a tree on its leaves
 
01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
you water it at space many small
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
businesses already paid good wages
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
but many large businesses are the ones
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
who force their overworked and underpaid
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
employees onto the government roles
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
and that's corporate welfare plain and
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
simple there was also a point in that
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
email that said
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature shouldn't interfere in
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
the relationship between labor and
 
01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.149 align:start position:0%
the relationship between labor and
management

01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
and not only do i want to remember that
 
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
when a
 
01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
certain senate legislation comes over
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
and i might fundamentally disagree with
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
some folks and that's perfectly fine i'm
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
happy to do so
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
but the simple fact of the matter is for
 
01:10:18.239 --> 01:10:18.790 align:start position:0%
but the simple fact of the matter is for
me

01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
that somebody has to stand up for labor
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
the relationship with those who work and
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
those who hold the goods
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
is not an equal one in a world where
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
folks have to work
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
this is the longest period of time that
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
the us has gone without a raise
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
and i think it's time to change that and
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
i want to end on one more
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
quote from president truman that i think
 
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
is valuable to the conversation
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
when he doubled the minimum wage he said
 
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
in the 1949 state of the union
 
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
quote we have rejected the discredited
 
01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:50.550 align:start position:0%
quote we have rejected the discredited
theory

01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
theory
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
that the fortunes of the nation should
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
be in the hands of a privileged few
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
we have abandoned the trickle-down
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
concept of national prosperity
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
instead we believe that our economic
 
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
system should rest on a democratic
 
01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:03.430 align:start position:0%
system should rest on a democratic
foundation

01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
foundation
 
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
and that wealth should be created for
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
the benefit of all
 
01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
minimum wage fixed by law should be
 
01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
raised to at least 75 cents an hour
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
and that is what i'll conclude my
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
testimony with
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
i would ask that to retain motion be
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
not um that be shot down
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions any other
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
so you know i have a few hands
 
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan followed by
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'll be uh
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
relatively brief because i think uh
 
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative adjutant has
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
said most of what needs to be said um
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
and said it well
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
um the um um i guess you'd start off by
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
asking um if we retain this bill um
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
are there members of the committee um in
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
the majority
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
who will help to uh work in the bill to
 
01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
make it acceptable to
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll leave that there but i i
 
01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.630 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll leave that there but i i
wouldn't

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
i think it would instruct my vote um to
 
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
know that we are actually going to work
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
on it not just sit on it
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
and secondly um i just want to say that
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
um a few years back when the um
 
01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
a fight for 15 uh was first
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh invented or suggested um
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
a 15 minimum wage was a fairly radical
 
01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.390 align:start position:0%
a 15 minimum wage was a fairly radical
idea

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
and i think i think it had shock value
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
um a 15 minimum wage is no longer
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
the least bit radical it is mainstream
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
um it is being
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
passed as uh the representative just
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
pointed out by
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
states like florida um and um
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
i think it's time for new hampshire to
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
join the mainstream
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
and get its uh eventual 15 minimum wage
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
passed um so i'm i'm sitting on my vote
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
at the moment wondering if uh there's
 
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
going to be any indication that this
 
01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:14.070 align:start position:0%
going to be any indication that this
will

01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
be worked on by the majority of the
 
01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:19.110 align:start position:0%
be worked on by the majority of the
committee

01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
i'll answer that question when my turn
 
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
comes around representative bouchard
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
um i just want to add to thank you mr
 
01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.149 align:start position:0%
um i just want to add to thank you mr
chair

01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
i just want to add to josh's
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
eloquent uh advocacy for
 
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
voting for increasing the minimum wage
 
01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:35.830 align:start position:0%
voting for increasing the minimum wage
because

01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote for the increase
 
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
because i believe that no one who works
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
40 hours a week should struggle to put
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
food on their table
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
and pay their rent however too many of
 
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
our families are struggling
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
to make ends meet while working two or
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
three jobs
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
i believe that many businesses find that
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
raising wages increases productivity
 
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
reduces turnover and improves morale
 
01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
it is common sense that workers with
 
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
more income are likely to have access
 
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
to more reliable transportation to work
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
child care health care and reducing
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
absenteeism i also believe that it costs
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire taxpayers money
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
to provide basic needs when businesses
 
01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
pay their workers
 
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
far less than a living wage house bill
 
01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:29.430 align:start position:0%
far less than a living wage house bill
517

01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
517
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
is not a living wage however it will
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
reduce the need for workers applying for
 
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
safety net programs
 
01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bouchard
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh last time we
 
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
talked about this we talked about the
 
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
wage calculator at livingwage.mit.edu
 
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
and i hope everybody's had a chance to
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
just glance at that because
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
if you don't have the data that's in
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
there you only have half of the
 
01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.229 align:start position:0%
there you only have half of the
information

01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
you need to make a good decision on this
 
01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.430 align:start position:0%
you need to make a good decision on this
bill

01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
um if you've looked at it you see that
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
you're not going to find a place
 
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
for 800 a month you're you're um
 
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to spend more than ten
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
dollars a day on food
 
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
um an online certificate for southern
 
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire university
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
is over nine thousand dollars that isn't
 
01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
even covered on this
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that the people who grew up
 
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
with me or
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
shortly thereafter remember that
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
we could work a summer job and um
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
serve tables uh between classes
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
and make enough money to go to college
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
people today
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
can't even put food on their table they
 
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
have to call the welfare department they
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
have to go to the soup kitchen
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
people with jobs 40 hours a week
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
or more many times more can't even get
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
the basics
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
and that's just crazy in a state
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
that's one of the richest in the country
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
keep people at such a low income
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
that they can't even participate in our
 
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:06.870 align:start position:0%
that they can't even participate in our
society

01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
society
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
i want you to think about money like oil
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
in an
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
engine it's going to work best if the
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
money continues to circulate
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
that it comes to the people who are
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
going to spend it
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
they can buy shoes for their kids they
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
can go to grocery stores they can go
 
01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
out to eat and that all of that means
 
01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.430 align:start position:0%
out to eat and that all of that means
jobs

01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
this isn't just one person getting a
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
bigger paycheck
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
this is that money going into the
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
community and that's
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
really really the reason that we're
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
getting a minimum wage set and start on
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
a way up for prosperity
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%

01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
i do not see any other hands online i do
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
not see any hands here
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
um i will answer your question
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan um
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
but i want to start off with the fact
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
that um very well spoken
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
probably hadagen but i don't agree with
 
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
you that things are dead
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
in washington uh the reconciliation
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
package that both new hampshire or state
 
01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
senators or not
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
u.s senators voted against adding the
 
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
um to the stimulus package um
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
there's an article um a study that finds
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
that a 15
 
01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
minimum wage will cost 1300 granite
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
staters their jobs
 
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
concern is the too significant an
 
01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.110 align:start position:0%
concern is the too significant an
increase

01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
employers who are just coming out of the
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
covid situation will
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
choose to reduce uh wages uh
 
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
instead of having weight staff they'll
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
have computer tablets and
 
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
a number of these different things uh we
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
currently have a 3.6
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate in new hampshire
 
01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
that's up from 2.6
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh but given what we've been through the
 
01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
last 12 months
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
um we're doing very well here in the
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
it is almost impossible to find
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
employees for certain jobs i can't speak
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
for the arrest
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
the rest of the state i can only speak
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
for what i see when i drive around
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
the manchester uh concord area
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
there are businesses um offering
 
01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
unskilled employees from 11.50 to
 
01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
13.50 an hour to work at fast food
 
01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:34.470 align:start position:0%
13.50 an hour to work at fast food
restaurants

01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
not a glorious job but this guy right
 
01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:37.510 align:start position:0%
not a glorious job but this guy right
here

01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh was the assistant manager to burger
 
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
king i saw my burger king thai
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
while i was working for an insurance
 
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
company i worked two jobs
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
um so i've done the job um
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
so i you know and both my daughters that
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
are college students
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
make significantly more than
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
so right now i would say these
 
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
these companies are having a hard time
 
01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
filling their positions between 11 and
 
01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:07.830 align:start position:0%
filling their positions between 11 and
13

01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
13
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
an hour to answer your specific question
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan
 
01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
um i was uh basically uh
 
01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
tarred and feathered for offering
 
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
through this committee about 10 years
 
01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:23.510 align:start position:0%
through this committee about 10 years
ago

01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
two 50 cent increases in the minimum
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
wage over a two-year period
 
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh back to the time uh i thought we
 
01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
could at least increase it a little bit
 
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that so many employers
 
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
are offering such a higher
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
starting salary or starting wage per
 
01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:40.870 align:start position:0%
starting salary or starting wage per
hour

01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
hour
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
the issues that i specifically have
 
01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan for this bill
 
01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:44.790 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan for this bill
are

01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
are threefold uh number one um i'd like
 
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
to increase the minimum wage this is my
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
personal belief
 
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
not shared by many members of my party
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
um that a five dollar
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
increase is significant and maybe too
 
01:20:01.199 --> 01:20:01.750 align:start position:0%
increase is significant and maybe too
much

01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:20:05.189 --> 01:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh in one foul school i however do like
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
the increase
 
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
one non-starter for me representative
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
sullivan is
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
an adjustment of the minimum wage by
 
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
consumer price index
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
an older gentleman 10 years ago told me
 
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
that legislators don't let things happen
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
automatically they must
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
stand behind their vote whether to
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
increase something or to decrease
 
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
something but they shouldn't rely on an
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
automatic increase
 
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
so i wouldn't be able to support that
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
there is a bill coming forward
 
01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
which i believe has the support of the
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
democrats as well as senator soucy
 
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
coming from the senate that will come to
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
us that separates the minimum wage for
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
tipped employees versus non-tipped
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
employees because that always is the rub
 
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
every time we increase it
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh increase it whether or not you're
 
01:20:56.159 --> 01:20:56.550 align:start position:0%
uh increase it whether or not you're
talking

01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
talking
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
all the employees or just the tip versus
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
non-tip which would allow this
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
legislation ability to make
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
um a difference between the two this one
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
increases the tipped wage to
 
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
um fifty percent which is
 
01:21:12.629 --> 01:21:12.639 align:start position:0%
something i i don't see as necessary and
 
01:21:12.639 --> 01:21:13.189 align:start position:0%
something i i don't see as necessary and
lastly

01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
lastly
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
the part of the bill that says anyone
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18 years ago
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
age shall be eight dollars per hour for
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
the first six months of employment
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
while i understand the sponsor's goal
 
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
they're trying to look at what we call
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
something we already have in new
 
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire which is a training wage
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
um but someone who graduates from high
 
01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:33.990 align:start position:0%
um but someone who graduates from high
school

01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
early at 17 years of age 17 and a half
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
going out trying to make a living and
 
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
you're they
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
there shouldn't be this just doesn't
 
01:21:44.229 --> 01:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
mesh i understand what they're trying to
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
do but i don't think this is very good i
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
think this actually hurts
 
01:21:50.709 --> 01:21:50.719 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to do um
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative smith i take a little bit
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
of exception with a statement you made
 
01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:55.350 align:start position:0%
of exception with a statement you made
and

01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think you meant it to be mean or
 
01:21:58.950 --> 01:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
anything um
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
you said keep people at a low income
 
01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
um i don't think that's fair i don't
 
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
think anyone here who is voting
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
in favor of this
 
01:22:11.669 --> 01:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
being retained wants to keep anyone at a
 
01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
low income
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
i know this legislator does not
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
wages are higher um than the seven
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
then the current minimum wage i think
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
everyone needs to
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that the same way i could
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
so will we work with it yes do i believe
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
that a minimum wage will be coming out
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
of washington d.c
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
yes i think it will be ten dollars now
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
or something like that the
 
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
democrats have the votes in the senate
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
and the house to do this
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
um they should do this
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
um and um maybe 15 is a
 
01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
little too far for them but they should
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
at least come up
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
with something that all members of the
 
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
united states congress and senate should
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
be able to deal with
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
again each one of those congressmen and
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
senators are dealing with different
 
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
areas of the country
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
so but i think they should do that as
 
01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
well so i hope that answers your
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
question representative sullivan about
 
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
my issues
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
um as is representative sullivan i would
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
itl this bill because of the items i
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
specifically just outlined i would like
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
to retain it
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
and see what happens on a federal level
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
but again i am in the minority in in the
 
01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:36.950 align:start position:0%
but again i am in the minority in in the
uh

01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
in my party regarding the the minimum
 
01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.350 align:start position:0%
in my party regarding the the minimum
wage

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
wage
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
um so those are
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
my comments for whatever they are worth
 
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte thank you
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
i wanna i'd like people to kind of think
 
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
about something this was a kind of a
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
an example i brought up four years ago
 
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
we were going through a similar bill
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
um at the time both my kids
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh were at home and uh
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's very instructive as to the
 
01:24:11.669 --> 01:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
effects of the minimum wage i think too
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
many people
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
they don't look at the the economics of
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
it or
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
or what happens when you institute a
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh random with minimum wage here's the
 
01:24:23.679 --> 01:24:24.790 align:start position:0%
uh random with minimum wage here's the
example

01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
at the time my son was making 15.50 an
 
01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:28.310 align:start position:0%
at the time my son was making 15.50 an
hour

01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
hour
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
working for a landscaping company he
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
busted his butt he would get up at 5
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
30 in the morning and he would get home
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
at six at night
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes later working out in the hot
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
sun and the
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
freezing rain it didn't matter you know
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
he'd work 50 60 hours a week busted as
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
much that would make a lot of money
 
01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
15.50 an hour at the same time my
 
01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
daughter was working
 
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
at a as an ice cream scooper at a little
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
place down in york beach maine
 
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
she made 825 of them she made a little
 
01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
more because she got tipped
 
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
she would get up at 10 in the morning
 
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
saunder down and then work from 11
 
01:25:11.669 --> 01:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
to say six at night fight the different
 
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
set of jobs
 
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
but let's just run through a scenario
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
now what happens when
 
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
she now is mandated to get 15
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
an hour she gets 15 an hour
 
01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
not only does that increase all the
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
business costs
 
01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:30.639 align:start position:0%
cost of ice cream everything at that
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
business but what happens
 
01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
to the landscape company now
 
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
with that who's paying my son 15.50 an
 
01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:39.110 align:start position:0%
with that who's paying my son 15.50 an
hour

01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
hour
 
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
if you've got a job where you can go
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
scoop ice cream for 15
 
01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:44.719 align:start position:0%
an hour or go bust your butt 68 hours a
 
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
week for 15.50
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen i'll tell you
 
01:25:50.629 --> 01:25:50.639 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen either
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
my son is going to go find an easier job
 
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
for 15 an hour which you wouldn't do
 
01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
because that's not how he is
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
or the landscape company now is going to
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
have to boost
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
that starting pay to get people to work
 
01:26:02.639 --> 01:26:02.950 align:start position:0%
that starting pay to get people to work
there

01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be 15.50 an hour
 
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
anymore now it's going to be 20
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
22. an hour to get individuals to go to
 
01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:10.790 align:start position:0%
22. an hour to get individuals to go to
work

01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
in that type of environment then play
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
that out
 
01:26:17.110 --> 01:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
what happens what happens to the
 
01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:17.910 align:start position:0%
what happens what happens to the
landscape

01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
landscape
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
company all right they have to start
 
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
charging more because they're paying
 
01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:21.669 align:start position:0%
charging more because they're paying
their

01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
their employees and it's just this
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
leviathan of the everything that is
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
impacted by setting an average
 
01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
arbitrary minimum wage not something
 
01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
that's set by the free market
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
or supply and demand um that's that
 
01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.070 align:start position:0%
or supply and demand um that's that
example

01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know i every time we talk about a
 
01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
minimum wage or a living wage
 
01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
i always hear somebody can't survive and
 
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
get an apartment for x amount or this or
 
01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:52.629 align:start position:0%
get an apartment for x amount or this or
that

01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
you know i look back that the chairman
 
01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
made some comments about that how he
 
01:26:58.629 --> 01:26:58.639 align:start position:0%
started out
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
i started out the same way um
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
we didn't at age 20 living in atlanta i
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford to go out and buy my own
 
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh apartment i lived with five other
 
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
guys so we could afford
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
to live um one of my first girlfriends
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
when i lived in new york for a while
 
01:27:21.189 --> 01:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
she and five girls lived in a studio
 
01:27:21.199 --> 01:27:21.830 align:start position:0%
she and five girls lived in a studio
apartment

01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
apartment
 
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
in new york because that's the only way
 
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
they could afford
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
to live they made it happen they didn't
 
01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
each expect to have their own
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
1200 1500 apartment they made
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
choices they made choices they wanted to
 
01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
be a flight attendant for american
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
airlines so they made the choice
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
to do what they had to do to make that
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um representative
 
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
i respect you and i think you're an
 
01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
honest actor um
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
and that's why i just fundamentally
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
disagree with you i think
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
um when we talk about um the stuff i
 
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned in my testimony
 
01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:10.719 align:start position:0%
preempted i think some of the things he
 
01:28:12.629 --> 01:28:12.639 align:start position:0%
said because i've just heard
 
01:28:14.229 --> 01:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of that stuff over and over again
 
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
every time we talk about the minimum
 
01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:16.310 align:start position:0%
every time we talk about the minimum
wage

01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
wage
 
01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that you mentioned
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
was uh sort of the rising tide argument
 
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
um where you know if you're paying
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
somebody a low skilled worker
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit more um then that's going
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
to raise the cost of everything
 
01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
i think i talked about that when we
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
talked about the price of goods
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
uh in 2009 when the minimum wage was
 
01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
still 7.25 an hour
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
um you know cost of fast food was a
 
01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
little bit less
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
or it was considerably less than it is
 
01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
now i think it was just when we used the
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
big mac example
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know that hamburger in 2009 cost
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
about three dollars
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's getting up closer to about five
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
dollars now so even when that wage has
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
an increase
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
because of the cost of inflation
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
generally that good has
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
gone up so i don't think that had
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the minimum wage
 
01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:00.070 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the minimum wage
necessarily

01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
when you talk about you know uh in times
 
01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:03.430 align:start position:0%
when you talk about you know uh in times
past

01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:29:05.669 --> 01:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
folks working for a little bit less uh
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
one of the arguments in dc
 
01:29:11.189 --> 01:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
by senator thune uh was well when he was
 
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
a kid he made six dollars an hour
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
and uh you know that should be fine when
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
senator thune was working for six
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour the minimum wage had the
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
buying power of 24
 
01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
an hour which really i think leads into
 
01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
the inflation point
 
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
um you know we're talking about a 15
 
01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
increase over the course of five years
 
01:29:32.229 --> 01:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
like who knows what the value of the us
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
dollar is going to be in five years with
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
you know passing stimulus bills where
 
01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
trillions and trillions
 
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
of dollars from the federal reserve are
 
01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
pumped into the economy that's going to
 
01:29:45.669 --> 01:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
increase inflation just and
 
01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh it's going to make that dollar worth
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
less so
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to be more expensive in order
 
01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
to survive
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
in five years when you have an age i
 
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
think the 15
 
01:29:57.510 --> 01:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
hour minimum wage is already a pretty
 
01:29:59.110 --> 01:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
good compromise you know
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
based on the cost of living i didn't
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
vote for the 22 one
 
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
but i do think that 15 is a good solid
 
01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
four in five years from now
 
01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
and you know i i i always hear the
 
01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:10.310 align:start position:0%
and you know i i i always hear the
argument

01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
argument
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
um well you know an emt is making 13
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
an hour so why does a you know burger
 
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
flipper think that they get to make you
 
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
know 15
 
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
an hour i guess my question is why is an
 
01:30:22.149 --> 01:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
emt making 13
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
an hour you know an emt is a pretty pain
 
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
in the neck job
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
very stressful very difficult for those
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
folks and i want
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
that emt to have the power to go to
 
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
their employer and say hey
 
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
i could go get a job you know flipping
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
burgers even though i think that's
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know fairly difficult job standing
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
over the hot stove all day and dealing
 
01:30:40.719 --> 01:30:41.350 align:start position:0%
over the hot stove all day and dealing
with

01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
you know not very nice customers uh what
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
are you going to pay
 
01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:46.719 align:start position:0%
i think it gives them a little more
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
flexibility in their employment
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
it gives them the opportunity to
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
threaten their employer that they'll go
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
um and again as i said in my testimony i
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
fundamentally believe
 
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
that it is our responsibility to stand
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
on the side of labor
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
representative i must admit i apologize
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
you were supposed to make the motion and
 
01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:14.719 align:start position:0%
i made a mistake but representative
 
01:31:14.719 --> 01:31:27.030 align:start position:0%
i made a mistake but representative
that's

01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to hear the
 
01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:31.110 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to hear the
representative

01:31:31.110 --> 01:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative can you hear me
 
01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
now much better thank you
 
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
as i was starting to say i would since
 
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
everybody is uh this is a hot topic
 
01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
and folks want to uh expound on it uh
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
their their views
 
01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate that i would feel
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
remiss if i didn't point out
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
just a couple of things that i believe
 
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
i understand everybody's concern
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
for a living wage i understand how
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
folks want to make sure that things go
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
the way that they want them to do it
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
the problem is and the part that nobody
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
seems to be addressing
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
is um as uh representative adjutant
 
01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
pointed out uh
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
affairs in florida they're not germane
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
to this bill
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
he spoke about 1951 and what was going
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
on there
 
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
again not germaine the prices of big
 
01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:33.990 align:start position:0%
again not germaine the prices of big
macs

01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
macs
 
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
in australia
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
not jermaine what is germaine is that in
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
a free market society
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
which we have at the moment
 
01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
laissez faire is what goes on
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
there is absolutely no place
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
for government to take the side of
 
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
either the employer
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
or the employee period
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
that's just the way it is the market
 
01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:03.590 align:start position:0%
that's just the way it is the market
decides

01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
decides
 
01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
hearing some of the folks um who are in
 
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
favor of this
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
they keep referring to what uh somebody
 
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
should make or how they should make it
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
i suggest they open a business and pay
 
01:33:14.709 --> 01:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
them that
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to force the
 
01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
government to force other folks to do it
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
plain and simple this is not something
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
the government is should be involved in
 
01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
it should be allowed we as government
 
01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
should allow
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
folks to do what they do which is free
 
01:33:28.719 --> 01:33:30.629 align:start position:0%
folks to do what they do which is free
enterprise

01:33:30.629 --> 01:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
enterprise
 
01:33:32.709 --> 01:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
that's my two cents except i would want
 
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
to also point out
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that's been being
 
01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:37.430 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that's been being
said

01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
is that um an incremental increase
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
would be a better thing let me just give
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
you a small little
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh anecdotal story if i have a lobster
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
and i have a boiling pot of water and i
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
throw it in
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
it's dead if i have a pot
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
and i put a lobster in and turn the
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
water on of the heat
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
on it's still dead as is this bill
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
and i will not support it in any form
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
so much one more comment um
 
01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean if we're talking about the
 
01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
non-germaness of 1951 the only
 
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
non-german part of that i'd say
 
01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
is that this country used to have
 
01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
something called price control
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know in uh roosevelt truman's time
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
it was a little bit easier to afford to
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
live in the united states
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
housing costs were less um cost
 
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
healthcare was a little bit less
 
01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about an expensive
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
society of living nowadays
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
and that's the only non-germane element
 
01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
mr chairman going to talk about
 
01:34:51.109 --> 01:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
i think it's simple if we're going to
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
times when i was actually alive and
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
still can remember
 
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
then we must also say if it's germaine
 
01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
then certainly the gold standard is
 
01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:10.149 align:start position:0%
then certainly the gold standard is
germaine

01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
germaine
 
01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
so all of that back then
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
there was no inflation because we had
 
01:35:17.830 --> 01:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
real gold
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
and real silver i don't know how many
 
01:35:21.199 --> 01:35:21.750 align:start position:0%
and real silver i don't know how many
others

01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
in this committee can remember those
 
01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.350 align:start position:0%
in this committee can remember those
days

01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
and i may be the eldest eldest one here
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
but i remember them and we went year
 
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
after year
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
after year without any inflation this is
 
01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:37.590 align:start position:0%
after year without any inflation this is
all

01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
all caused by lack of
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
gold and silver and the fact that we
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
just print money and then we're
 
01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
constantly chasing our tails
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
so how many people can remember when you
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
paid your babysitter with
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
silver i so i'll be voting against it
 
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you president thank you mr
 
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
chairman uh
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
something representative huff reminded
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
me of a uh
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
another great example of a force
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
15 an hour a several of you who were
 
01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
still on the committee i think a few
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
years back when we were going through a
 
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
similar bill we had the owner of
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
the seventh settlement brewery and
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
restaurant in dover
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
come and testify uh my wife and i used
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
to go there quite often it was always
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
great the
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
beer was good the food was great awesome
 
01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.149 align:start position:0%
beer was good the food was great awesome
service

01:36:36.149 --> 01:36:36.159 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
and then one day the owner decided that
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
he was going to pay all his
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
employees 15 an hour whether you were
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
the dishwasher
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
a server bartender whatever
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
and there was going to be no tipping so
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
everything was going to be fair at the
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
seventh settlement brewery and
 
01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:59.350 align:start position:0%
seventh settlement brewery and
restaurant

01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
my wife and i went back uh not long
 
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
after he testified before this committee
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
humans being as they are when you're
 
01:37:14.229 --> 01:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
everybody's making the same
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
we can i can tell you the effort and the
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
service from the servers that were there
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
now making 15
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
an hour rather than maybe 20 to 25 that
 
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
they had making as attempted
 
01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
wage earners were now not quite as
 
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.510 align:start position:0%
wage earners were now not quite as
attentive

01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
attentive
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
within a few months after that the
 
01:37:32.239 --> 01:37:32.870 align:start position:0%
within a few months after that the
restaurant

01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
shut down and then a few months after
 
01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:35.910 align:start position:0%
shut down and then a few months after
that

01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
the brewery shut down so it wasn't i
 
01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
think it was less than a year from the
 
01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
time he implemented
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
the 15 same wage for everybody the
 
01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
place was out of business a once great
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
place because
 
01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
he wanted to however you want to
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
describe it be fair
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
whatever it wanted to be it ended up
 
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:08.310 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:13.830 align:start position:0%

a couple things um first of all
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
i don't disagree with anything that uh
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative edgington has
 
01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
stated um
 
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
secondly um i like most of what's in
 
01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:27.810 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:38:27.810 --> 01:38:29.189 align:start position:0%
this bill
[Music]

01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
and would gladly vote for it um that
 
01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
motion is not on
 
01:38:36.629 --> 01:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
before us um
 
01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:37.770 align:start position:0%
third thing um
 
01:38:37.770 --> 01:38:40.149 align:start position:0%
third thing um
[Music]

01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman you've never given me reason
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
not trust you um i think uh
 
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's very important and um if you're
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
saying that you will work on this bill
 
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
um for next year
 
01:38:57.910 --> 01:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
if no other bill passes this year
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
because there will be others you're
 
01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:00.229 align:start position:0%
because there will be others you're
right

01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
um um i will work with you
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i actually think
 
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
that we're not done with minimum wage uh
 
01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
regardless of what happens in the house
 
01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
because we have crossover and we have
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh the feds will act
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sure before we are done here so it
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
may be attached to it as
 
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
a bill that's just my my guess
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative rudy thank you mr
 
01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:34.149 align:start position:0%

01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
of all um minimum wage bills i've seen
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
this one is one i think we can all work
 
01:39:43.679 --> 01:39:44.470 align:start position:0%
this one is one i think we can all work
with

01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
and um i hope we can go forward and i'm
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
i'm probably gonna vote to retain it too
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
so we can work on this together
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
seeing no other hands in the lob
 
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:07.360 align:start position:0%

members
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
it is house bill 589
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
required workers compensation to cover
 
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:21.520 align:start position:0%

01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
exposure
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
it was my initial desire to
 
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
pass this ought to pass and
 
01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
the republican members of the committee
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
had a caucus
 
01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
and during the caucus a number of items
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
were brought up with inconsistencies
 
01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
with some of the other bills that were
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
passed was this
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
really for all employees or is it just
 
01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
for first responders
 
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
and a number of things it was our
 
01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:50.870 align:start position:0%
and a number of things it was our
determination

01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
determination
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:59.700 --> 01:42:59.710 align:start position:0%
there's some disagreement between
 
01:42:59.710 --> 01:43:01.030 align:start position:0%
there's some disagreement between

01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the amendment
 
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
that has been presented and
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
while it was my intent to come in here
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
and ask the committee to retain
 
01:43:25.109 --> 01:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
the bill we are going to have to come
 
01:43:26.709 --> 01:43:26.719 align:start position:0%
back into this committee
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
again uh before we are done
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
and um i would rather
 
01:43:38.229 --> 01:43:38.239 align:start position:0%
dispense with this correctly versus
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
retaining it and have it wait another
 
01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:41.109 align:start position:0%
retaining it and have it wait another
year

01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:43:46.629 --> 01:43:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
i don't feel the republican members of
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
the committee can pass it the way it is
 
01:43:53.350 --> 01:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
there are just too many issues with with
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
some of the things and misunderstanding
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
i'll take responsibility for this
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
because i
 
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
either misread the initial bill and i
 
01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:12.629 --> 01:44:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask my committee members
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
and again i don't know how
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
we're not i don't know how appropriate
 
01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:44:26.229 --> 01:44:26.239 align:start position:0%
um we do have to come back
 
01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
i would like to present all of our
 
01:44:32.950 --> 01:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
concerns to representative cahill
 
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
um to let him come back since we do have
 
01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
to come back
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
and if the time we still are not
 
01:44:46.629 --> 01:44:46.639 align:start position:0%
convinced we can still retain the bill
 
01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
this is contrary to what was agreed to
 
01:44:53.189 --> 01:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
with my caucus members
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
um so i kind of throwing this at him and
 
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
i apologize
 
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
it was just something that
 
01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
my the vice chairman submitted to me
 
01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
in a piece of paper he presented to me
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
and now i'm just very confused and i
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
can't vote on something
 
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
that i'm confused on um
 
01:45:17.109 --> 01:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
is there any objection and
 
01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
and please be honest with me
 
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
because we do have the ability to have a
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
if they're willing to allow since we do
 
01:45:32.229 --> 01:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
have to come back anyway
 
01:45:34.870 --> 01:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
represent vice chairman this is a
 
01:45:36.629 --> 01:45:36.639 align:start position:0%
procedural question
 
01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:40.639 align:start position:0%
um given the hesitancy to move
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that we didn't notice
 
01:46:01.030 --> 01:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
which would allow us to discuss the
 
01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:01.750 align:start position:0%
which would allow us to discuss the
issues

01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:06.070 align:start position:0%
issues
without

01:46:06.070 --> 01:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
i don't really think we can because we
 
01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
didn't notice it
 
01:46:10.709 --> 01:46:10.719 align:start position:0%
and i wouldn't want to push that
 
01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte
 
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
chairman i think uh maybe a caucus would
 
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
be hard
 
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
i i agree and but i don't know how we do
 
01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:20.149 align:start position:0%
i i agree and but i don't know how we do
that

01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:22.629 --> 01:46:22.639 align:start position:0%
um we can go to another room and we can
 
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
have a few of the people online call in
 
01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
we can uh eliminate the video we can
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
turn the microphones off
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
on the zoom and we can ask a
 
01:46:31.679 --> 01:46:32.470 align:start position:0%
on the zoom and we can ask a
representative

01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:46:34.149 --> 01:46:34.159 align:start position:0%
adjutant to leave and that would give us
 
01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
the entire room to our service
 
01:46:37.590 --> 01:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
will you have republican members on the
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um just a moment
 
01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:50.480 align:start position:0%

01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
we can do what we've done before i can
 
01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:54.149 align:start position:0%
we can do what we've done before i can
utilize

01:46:54.149 --> 01:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
utilize
 
01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
a conference call call-in number on my
 
01:46:59.109 --> 01:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
cell phone
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%

01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%

of the current zoom and sign onto
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
a separate one and
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to utilize the zoom you
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%

basically it
 
02:19:28.309 --> 02:19:28.319 align:start position:0%

this bill to wait
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
for an entire year but based on our
 
02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:36.880 align:start position:0%

02:19:54.309 --> 02:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
to this bill and then if we are all in
 
02:19:57.680 --> 02:19:58.550 align:start position:0%
to this bill and then if we are all in
agreement

02:19:58.550 --> 02:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
02:20:02.790 --> 02:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
um i would ask the senate
 
02:20:05.429 --> 02:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
to attach it to a bill that comes over
 
02:20:07.429 --> 02:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
to us a crossover so we can have it
 
02:20:10.870 --> 02:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
this session um i think we can find some
 
02:20:12.230 --> 02:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
bills that are coming over where we
 
02:20:14.230 --> 02:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
could find a tremendous to it
 
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
to bring it over but
 
02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
i don't have the ability in the next two
 
02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:20.790 align:start position:0%
i don't have the ability in the next two
weeks

02:20:20.790 --> 02:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
to have another hearing have this put
 
02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:25.030 align:start position:0%
to have another hearing have this put
together

02:20:25.030 --> 02:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:20:27.830 --> 02:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh and then i will recognize
 
02:20:29.190 --> 02:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
representative proud who's going to
 
02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
speak on just some of the issues
 
02:20:32.550 --> 02:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
that we're concerned with so you
 
02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:34.309 align:start position:0%
that we're concerned with so you
understand

02:20:34.309 --> 02:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
but in doing so i just wanted you to
 
02:20:37.760 --> 02:20:38.150 align:start position:0%
but in doing so i just wanted you to
know

02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:20:40.790 --> 02:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
that i'm willing to do this with
 
02:20:42.309 --> 02:20:42.319 align:start position:0%
representative cahill
 
02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
so this does not have to wait a year uh
 
02:20:46.790 --> 02:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
we can hopefully
 
02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
attach this to something else
 
02:20:52.950 --> 02:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative proud
 
02:20:55.110 --> 02:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh so my big
 
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
concern is
 
02:20:57.590 --> 02:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
clarity if we've really gotten the right
 
02:20:59.270 --> 02:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
feedback on this bill
 
02:21:00.870 --> 02:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
um the title of the bill references
 
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
prophylactic treatment which
 
02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
i think naturally leads one to look at
 
02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:05.830 align:start position:0%
i think naturally leads one to look at
the

02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
um the definition uh in the same section
 
02:21:10.230 --> 02:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
as the other definition
 
02:21:14.230 --> 02:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
but in uh 14a about post-exposure
 
02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
prophylactics which cross-references
 
02:21:17.830 --> 02:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
definition 1e
 
02:21:19.349 --> 02:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
critical exposure which is what this
 
02:21:22.950 --> 02:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
bill really the meat of what it modified
 
02:21:25.110 --> 02:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
however that 1e critical exposure is
 
02:21:28.070 --> 02:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
also used in another section as well
 
02:21:29.590 --> 02:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
and we didn't talk about that other
 
02:21:31.349 --> 02:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
section and what the changes would do
 
02:21:32.309 --> 02:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
over there
 
02:21:35.510 --> 02:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
if anything and it's really wasn't
 
02:21:37.030 --> 02:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
perfectly obvious that it would have
 
02:21:38.710 --> 02:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
changes outside of
 
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
really the section we focused on for
 
02:21:42.150 --> 02:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
first responders
 
02:21:44.070 --> 02:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note also focuses a lot on
 
02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
the municipal association leading one to
 
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
believe that this
 
02:21:48.389 --> 02:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
the major effect is regarding first
 
02:21:50.469 --> 02:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
responders and all that makes me
 
02:21:51.670 --> 02:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
concerned if we really got the right
 
02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
feedback that we should have gotten on
 
02:21:53.990 --> 02:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
this bill uh
 
02:21:56.070 --> 02:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
if i was misled at first by reading that
 
02:21:57.670 --> 02:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
took well to realize the bill could have
 
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
effects outside of just first responders
 
02:22:01.990 --> 02:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if other interesting part
 
02:22:03.510 --> 02:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
interested parties may have missed it as
 
02:22:03.520 --> 02:22:04.550 align:start position:0%
interested parties may have missed it as
well

02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:22:05.910 --> 02:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
and i really want to make sure that we
 
02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
fully understand what the effects on
 
02:22:09.270 --> 02:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
that other section because the
 
02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
definition is used in multiple places
 
02:22:13.990 --> 02:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
what those effects are and if anything
 
02:22:15.750 --> 02:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
and really fully understand that before
 
02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr like any other comments
 
02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:23.990 align:start position:0%
thank you mr like any other comments
here

02:22:23.990 --> 02:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:22:27.990 --> 02:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:31.349 align:start position:0%
 
online

02:22:31.349 --> 02:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:34.630 --> 02:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:37.429 --> 02:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
thank you um i'm wondering from a
 
02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
procedural standpoint
 
02:22:42.309 --> 02:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
um whether we could
 
02:22:45.030 --> 02:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh do that same work we don't have to
 
02:22:46.469 --> 02:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
vote on this today
 
02:22:48.309 --> 02:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
and we are coming back to vote on
 
02:22:50.309 --> 02:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
another bill we've got another bill to
 
02:22:50.319 --> 02:22:51.270 align:start position:0%
another bill we've got another bill to
exec

02:22:51.270 --> 02:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
exec
 
02:22:53.590 --> 02:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
and so um you could do the same work
 
02:22:55.510 --> 02:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
that you were suggesting with uh
 
02:22:58.469 --> 02:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
rudy ogden and representative cahill and
 
02:22:59.830 --> 02:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
then bring it back to
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
um this committee
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
to vote on when we did do what is it 500
 
02:23:10.790 --> 02:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
not yeah 501 we've still got to exec 501
 
02:23:13.750 --> 02:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
so and then we could just send it to the
 
02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
senate in a normal
 
02:23:18.150 --> 02:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
fashion rather than i mean
 
02:23:21.270 --> 02:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
what you're suggesting could work but
 
02:23:24.070 --> 02:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
it requires cooperation from the senate
 
02:23:26.550 --> 02:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
which we don't always get
 
02:23:31.190 --> 02:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
so what about just working on it
 
02:23:33.429 --> 02:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
and bringing it back for exactly with an
 
02:23:33.439 --> 02:23:36.230 align:start position:0%
and bringing it back for exactly with an
amendment

02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:38.150 --> 02:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
i will respond to that uh since you
 
02:23:39.990 --> 02:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
asked me a question but i'll take
 
02:23:46.710 --> 02:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
any other comments first please
 
02:23:49.750 --> 02:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
no other comments online
 
02:23:51.429 --> 02:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
all right representative sullivan it was
 
02:23:53.110 --> 02:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
always my understanding that this bill
 
02:23:55.830 --> 02:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be for first responders
 
02:23:58.150 --> 02:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh that was the way representative white
 
02:23:59.510 --> 02:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
first proposed it
 
02:24:01.590 --> 02:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
now with representative cahill six years
 
02:24:04.950 --> 02:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
ago or five years ago i believe
 
02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
specifically because of an incident that
 
02:24:08.790 --> 02:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
happened up in lebanon where he was a
 
02:24:13.830 --> 02:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
is for anything for any
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
office any factory anything
 
02:24:23.590 --> 02:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that was the intent
 
02:24:27.670 --> 02:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
of this legislation um
 
02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:30.870 align:start position:0%
of this legislation um
if

02:24:30.870 --> 02:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:33.910 --> 02:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
that if
 
02:24:37.429 --> 02:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
the title in in the guts of the bill
 
02:24:39.190 --> 02:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
are different because it's not just what
 
02:24:40.710 --> 02:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
we're looking at this this is what got
 
02:24:41.270 --> 02:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
us all
 
02:24:43.990 --> 02:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
confused if you just look at the bill
 
02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:45.510 align:start position:0%
confused if you just look at the bill
itself

02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
itself
 
02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
okay it's pretty straightforward
 
02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm guilty of reading it briefly
 
02:24:54.630 --> 02:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
saying yep yep i got familiarity with
 
02:24:56.150 --> 02:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
this yep there's just a couple things
 
02:24:58.070 --> 02:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
here this thing looks fine
 
02:24:59.670 --> 02:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
but then you have to correlate it back
 
02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:07.349 --> 02:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
and that's where it gets fuzzy
 
02:25:12.150 --> 02:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:15.190 --> 02:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
so i guess my first question is is that
 
02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
was this incorrect or was that a bait
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
and switch
 
02:25:21.349 --> 02:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
not intentional or intentional whatever
 
02:25:22.830 --> 02:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
i would do i would assume it was not
 
02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:24.150 align:start position:0%
i would do i would assume it was not
intentional

02:25:24.150 --> 02:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
intentional
 
02:25:26.950 --> 02:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
so we have intended for first responders
 
02:25:29.190 --> 02:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
right well that's
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
we have three people that say um it's
 
02:25:33.510 --> 02:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
only for first responders and seven
 
02:25:34.469 --> 02:25:34.479 align:start position:0%
saying no
 
02:25:36.309 --> 02:25:36.319 align:start position:0%
you have to look back in 281 you gotta
 
02:25:38.270 --> 02:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
look at number six and uh
 
02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
rsa281 a6 823 you have to go back to all
 
02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
these different things
 
02:25:48.870 --> 02:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:51.750 --> 02:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
presented by legislative services i
 
02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:51.990 align:start position:0%
presented by legislative services i
don't

02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:25:55.110 --> 02:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
know um the
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
the question is is the time
 
02:25:57.359 --> 02:25:58.389 align:start position:0%
the question is is the time
representative

02:25:58.389 --> 02:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:26:01.190 --> 02:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
um we are all faced with a lot of things
 
02:26:09.190 --> 02:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:11.510 --> 02:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know you don't pay me enough to make
 
02:26:12.870 --> 02:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
these decisions
 
02:26:12.880 --> 02:26:16.870 align:start position:0%
these decisions
um

02:26:16.870 --> 02:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
the caucus um was um
 
02:26:23.270 --> 02:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
was um opinion
 
02:26:25.429 --> 02:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
and the motion on the floor is what it
 
02:26:28.230 --> 02:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
is um
 
02:26:31.990 --> 02:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
has retained and i can't guarantee we're
 
02:26:33.349 --> 02:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
all going to come up with something we
 
02:26:36.950 --> 02:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
i'm giving you the best option i can
 
02:26:42.309 --> 02:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
which is trying to keep it alive this
 
02:26:42.319 --> 02:26:43.510 align:start position:0%
which is trying to keep it alive this
session

02:26:43.510 --> 02:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:26:45.429 --> 02:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
and not next year because i don't want
 
02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
to go through as bro as my
 
02:26:49.190 --> 02:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
vice chairman said to me i don't want to
 
02:26:51.670 --> 02:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
go through another summer
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh trying to figure this out we all want
 
02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:56.070 align:start position:0%
uh trying to figure this out we all want
it

02:26:56.070 --> 02:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:26:58.280 --> 02:26:58.290 align:start position:0%
we ought to do it the the right way and
 
02:26:58.290 --> 02:27:00.790 align:start position:0%
we ought to do it the the right way and
[Music]

02:27:00.790 --> 02:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
the time constraints and other things um
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know this is going to require
 
02:27:08.550 --> 02:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
more than than representative cahill and
 
02:27:10.230 --> 02:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
i rudy and ogden
 
02:27:11.990 --> 02:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
to sit down deal with these things go
 
02:27:13.510 --> 02:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
back to each one of our caucuses come
 
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
back bring it back to make sure we all
 
02:27:15.990 --> 02:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
have the right amendment
 
02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
and i just not confident that can be
 
02:27:19.510 --> 02:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
done in the time frame that we have and
 
02:27:20.309 --> 02:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
that's why we
 
02:27:21.910 --> 02:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
promote the motion we have
 
02:27:23.750 --> 02:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative cahill
 
02:27:26.070 --> 02:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and you know from
 
02:27:29.510 --> 02:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
the legislation there was a reference
 
02:27:31.590 --> 02:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
91 something or other that said it was
 
02:27:33.429 --> 02:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
perspective for first responders and
 
02:27:34.550 --> 02:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's what
 
02:27:37.990 --> 02:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh i and i'm sure ols had in mind when
 
02:27:40.389 --> 02:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
we were the only offending problem
 
02:27:44.150 --> 02:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
was this issue of having the saliva be
 
02:27:46.230 --> 02:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
visible and insufficient magnitude which
 
02:27:47.670 --> 02:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
was kind of undefined
 
02:27:51.110 --> 02:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
so that's the only thing i changed i
 
02:27:54.389 --> 02:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
i believe it really is and still uh
 
02:27:56.150 --> 02:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
for first responders that certainly was
 
02:27:57.510 --> 02:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
my intent
 
02:27:59.590 --> 02:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
and i would hope that we could find a
 
02:28:01.590 --> 02:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
way to make that crystal clear
 
02:28:04.870 --> 02:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
for anyone who was in doubt and but i
 
02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
would welcome the opportunity to do that
 
02:28:07.750 --> 02:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
in whichever
 
02:28:11.349 --> 02:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
venue you feel is appropriate
 
02:28:13.030 --> 02:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
i i don't want to have to come back with
 
02:28:16.309 --> 02:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
this uh i think my police chief and town
 
02:28:18.389 --> 02:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
manager are getting a little tired of
 
02:28:20.309 --> 02:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
this being an issue every year
 
02:28:22.150 --> 02:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
i know that they don't like paying for
 
02:28:23.349 --> 02:28:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh workers
 
02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
comp uh insurance and then having to pay
 
02:28:28.150 --> 02:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
claims that are denied
 
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm pretty sure the municipal
 
02:28:31.830 --> 02:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
association would view this in the same
 
02:28:31.840 --> 02:28:32.870 align:start position:0%
association would view this in the same
way

02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:28:34.710 --> 02:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
so yes i agree with you that we should
 
02:28:35.990 --> 02:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
get it done and
 
02:28:39.270 --> 02:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh if if a work session uh and an
 
02:28:41.110 --> 02:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
amendment can't be done
 
02:28:43.590 --> 02:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh then then retained would be the way
 
02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:44.060 align:start position:0%
uh then then retained would be the way
um

02:28:44.060 --> 02:28:44.070 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:44.070 --> 02:28:45.349 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:28:48.070 --> 02:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know if if you uh i don't know
 
02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:48.389 align:start position:0%
i don't know if if you uh i don't know
if

02:28:48.389 --> 02:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:28:51.510 --> 02:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
mr ogden might have a word of wisdom to
 
02:28:54.070 --> 02:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh to clarify this up
 
02:28:56.389 --> 02:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
almost instantly or if that would be
 
02:28:56.399 --> 02:29:00.230 align:start position:0%
almost instantly or if that would be
allowed

02:29:00.230 --> 02:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:03.349 --> 02:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
i think we're gonna if i if we start
 
02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
getting into this it's gonna be a work
 
02:29:09.990 --> 02:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:12.469 --> 02:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
we are allowed to do right now it's one
 
02:29:13.349 --> 02:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
thing to have some
 
02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
brief discussions but we're talking
 
02:29:16.389 --> 02:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
about going through this bill
 
02:29:19.429 --> 02:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
correlating it back to each other
 
02:29:23.190 --> 02:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
option each other part of the um rsa
 
02:29:24.550 --> 02:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
which you know is going to take an hour
 
02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
mike and i'm just not sure
 
02:29:29.030 --> 02:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh that's more of a work session what i
 
02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:29.830 align:start position:0%
uh that's more of a work session what i
will

02:29:29.830 --> 02:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:29:32.710 --> 02:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
tell you is what i will ask you from a
 
02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:34.830 align:start position:0%
tell you is what i will ask you from a
parliamentary

02:29:34.830 --> 02:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
parliamentary
 
02:29:37.349 --> 02:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
standpoint if we have a bill that is
 
02:29:37.359 --> 02:29:39.510 align:start position:0%
standpoint if we have a bill that is
retained

02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
retained
 
02:29:41.590 --> 02:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
and in the next two weeks we come up
 
02:29:43.270 --> 02:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
with something
 
02:29:46.950 --> 02:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
that everybody likes what is the motion
 
02:29:48.950 --> 02:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
on the floor
 
02:29:52.870 --> 02:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
to overturn can you overturn the retain
 
02:29:54.870 --> 02:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
and ask for the amendment to an existing
 
02:29:56.070 --> 02:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
bill is that
 
02:29:59.590 --> 02:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
appropriately a parliamentary procedure
 
02:30:03.190 --> 02:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
not from the house for what we could do
 
02:30:06.309 --> 02:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
as a committee if the bill hasn't hit
 
02:30:07.990 --> 02:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
its deadline
 
02:30:12.630 --> 02:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:16.070 --> 02:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
we can reconsider them
 
02:30:18.469 --> 02:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
and send the bill for the different
 
02:30:18.479 --> 02:30:20.950 align:start position:0%
and send the bill for the different
representations

02:30:20.950 --> 02:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
representations
 
02:30:23.110 --> 02:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
as long as it's retained it'll never see
 
02:30:24.710 --> 02:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
the health course
 
02:30:26.790 --> 02:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
because we're not going to be meeting on
 
02:30:27.990 --> 02:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
the house floor until
 
02:30:34.070 --> 02:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:35.429 --> 02:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
but i just can't guarantee we're going
 
02:30:38.230 --> 02:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
to come up with a solution
 
02:30:39.910 --> 02:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
but there are other parliamentary
 
02:30:42.070 --> 02:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
options that we have available
 
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative baruti yeah thank you
 
02:30:44.880 --> 02:30:45.590 align:start position:0%
uh representative baruti yeah thank you
mr

02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
mr
 
02:30:48.870 --> 02:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
chairman i i couldn't hear uh
 
02:30:51.750 --> 02:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth but uh if if you
 
02:30:53.110 --> 02:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
could come up with something
 
02:30:55.349 --> 02:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
and we voted down the retain and then
 
02:30:57.190 --> 02:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
come back with an author pass
 
02:30:59.349 --> 02:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
on the floor i think that would be
 
02:31:00.710 --> 02:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
quicker than
 
02:31:03.349 --> 02:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
putting an amendment on a senate bill or
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
coming back next year
 
02:31:07.110 --> 02:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i couldn't hear uh
 
02:31:09.110 --> 02:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth good he was kind
 
02:31:09.910 --> 02:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
of mumbled
 
02:31:11.349 --> 02:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth was correcting
 
02:31:13.750 --> 02:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
me in that a retaining bill doesn't see
 
02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
the house floor
 
02:31:16.870 --> 02:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
and you can't change it the only thing
 
02:31:21.429 --> 02:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:27.270 --> 02:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
so that's what he was just clarifying
 
02:31:30.309 --> 02:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
representative rudy thank you
 
02:31:33.670 --> 02:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
um mr chair yes
 
02:31:36.710 --> 02:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps that's the the good option
 
02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
to uh to work on this and then if the if
 
02:31:41.270 --> 02:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
we feel that it's
 
02:31:44.630 --> 02:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
viable all everybody in agreement then
 
02:31:48.150 --> 02:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh move to reconsider and hopefully
 
02:31:54.230 --> 02:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
agree to um as opposed to having to wait
 
02:32:04.469 --> 02:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
for the crossover
 
02:32:11.670 --> 02:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
02:32:13.910 --> 02:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none here we have a
 
02:32:15.510 --> 02:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor
 
02:32:36.830 --> 02:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:36.840 --> 02:32:39.349 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:32:39.349 --> 02:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:32:43.110 --> 02:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
votes yes warden
 
02:32:46.710 --> 02:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
warden says yes sir trump
 
02:32:50.830 --> 02:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:55.590 --> 02:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:00.710 --> 02:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
yes sullivan votes yes
 
02:33:04.830 --> 02:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
