yeah well thank you very much there's
 
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
does everybody have a copy of this up
 
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
front here okay so I'll take the copy
 
00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
those what I think I had that one last
 
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.309 align:start position:0%
those what I think I had that one last
week

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:17.319 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 align:start position:0%
school yeah I know I've had so many
 
00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
this okay I'll start it out
 
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.390 align:start position:0%
this okay I'll start it out
um

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
I over the last week or so since we've
 
00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 align:start position:0%
been given this side by side online and
 
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
I struggle to make my own
 
00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 align:start position:0%
copies I've sort of struggled looking at
 
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
the rules here I look at page one page
 
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
two three by the time I get to page six
 
00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 align:start position:0%
my mind's ready to
 
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
explode and I basically have hit the
 
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
wall um so what I'd like to do today is
 
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
try to if we can to look look at this in
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
terms of what are some of the takeaways
 
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
we're we're getting from this uh the
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
either the pluses or the minuses seeing
 
00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
that we have a responsibility to make
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations regarding all academic
 
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
standards in areas which are referen
 
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
within these rules which impact those
 
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
and also 193
 
00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
e2a so
 
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
um with that I'd like to just quickly go
 
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
through some of the definitions which we
 
00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 align:start position:0%
had so so we can have some further
 
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 align:start position:0%
discussion here since we've had this
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
given to us the discussions of the the
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
definitions on pages on on the copy that
 
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
I printed out is about like pages one
 
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
through five
 
00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
thereabouts um so it's just the first
 
00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:53.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
at one of the takeaways that I've taken
 
00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
here is that's um there number of
 
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.710 align:start position:0%
here is that's um there number of
statutory

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
definitions which been included
 
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
Within These proposed rules which are
 
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
contrary to statute that's written and
 
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
been adopted by the general court signed
 
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.270 align:start position:0%
been adopted by the general court signed
into

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
law and I think we need to address those
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
that that as a as an
 
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
issue um starting right out uh on that
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:32.879 align:start position:0%
is there anybody let's just quickly go
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
through this um applicability in order
 
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
to be an improved school public schools
 
00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
and publicy shall meet the applicable
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
criteria establishing these standards
 
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
any issues with
 
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.550 align:start position:0%
any issues with
that

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
area let's go on the next one then
 
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:52.360 align:start position:0%
except as provided in B below a public
 
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
school shall be approved as an
 
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
elementary school if it contains any of
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
the grades kindergarten through 8 and
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
Mees the rules applicable to all schools
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
and to each elementary school and you
 
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
can see what they have changed that
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
too except as provided in C below a
 
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
public school shall be approved as now
 
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:14.120 align:start position:0%
met school if it contains kindergarten
 
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
through 8 and meets the rules applicable
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
to all schools and to each Elementary
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
School believe it or not I was hit up at
 
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
the Grafton County budget meeting by a
 
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
representative regarding this one
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
itself so um Mr chair uh ju just going
 
00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:34.599 align:start position:0%
back to the the first part A yeah um so
 
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
there is a change on that because it's
 
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:39.560 align:start position:0%
added to be an approved school
 
00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:42.519 align:start position:0%
so this is just a question is that
 
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
setting up then a distinction between
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
public schools and
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
schools so said another way um would it
 
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
be all right for public schools and
 
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
public cies and publicy not to meet
 
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
these this applicable criteria and
 
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:05.800 align:start position:0%
therefore not be an approved
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
School represent this going to be a long
 
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
day no no but I mean I but you hear what
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
I'm saying though right I I got it I get
 
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
you that it it it's it's changing it
 
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:17.800 align:start position:0%
from public schools and public acmis
 
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
shall meet the criteria to only shall
 
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
meet the criteria if they want to be an
 
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
well what you see the way it was in the
 
00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:34.519 align:start position:0%
original I'm looking back in what we had
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
back in
 
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
2014 says in order to be an approved
 
00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
school they put that first public
 
00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
schools and public academies shall meet
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
the applicable criteria establishing
 
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
these standards I think I think we ought
 
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
to revert right back to what we have
 
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely I agree with you yeah is
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
there any objection to that by anybody
 
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
here so we'll make a note to Star the as
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
it was yeah okay the next one down
 
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.829 align:start position:0%
it was yeah okay the next one down
their

00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:01.839 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
change this was pointed out by
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
representative fellows at the Grafton
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
County meeting to me just on money and
 
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
we weren't even talking we were talking
 
00:10:13.069 --> 00:10:13.079 align:start position:0%
budget but she jumped this quickly
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
contains kindergarten through eight and
 
00:10:16.509 --> 00:10:16.519 align:start position:0%
meets the rules what about a school is
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
like the little blue School up in Landa
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:25.720 align:start position:0%
three doesn't it doesn't have four five
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
six seven
 
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
eight so they're changing it from if has
 
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
any of these grades any of the grades to
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
must have k through
 
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
eight well they're
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
saying as an elementary school if it
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
contains kindergarten through
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
eight so now what happens if it doesn't
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
contain kindergarten through grade8 what
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
happens if it only contain kindergarten
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
through grade three like the little blue
 
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
school I have a couple of schools like
 
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
that oh yes they're all over the state
 
00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:00.839 align:start position:0%
sprinkled everywhere if you go down to
 
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
part C the former part C or what's now
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
the part C they keep that language where
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
it says contains any of the grades 9
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
through 12 so in
 
00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
part in the part we're discussing right
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
now I think we should just leave the L
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
that strike
 
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
through so leave as is okay we'll start
 
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.389 align:start position:0%
through so leave as is okay we'll start
that

00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
too and going
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
down to the next one down there as
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
determined by the vote of the local
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
school board any combination of grades 4
 
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
through 8 may be organized as a public
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
middle school and so approved if it
 
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
schools right now it is grades 4 through
 
00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:49.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
school that's there's no change
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
according to uh G the attorneys you see
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
on the right hand side no change so
 
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
is jumping down to where representative
 
00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:06.519 align:start position:0%
Pell just
 
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
um this has no
 
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:17.240 align:start position:0%
change that that was the point I was
 
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
making they didn't change it down there
 
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
but they changed it in the yeah previous
 
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.670 align:start position:0%
but they changed it in the yeah previous
session

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay so we're no change we're good with
 
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
definitions uh academic standards has
 
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
defined in that
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
RSA and it says new
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
definition added so it's added to the
 
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
minimum standards and they're taking the
 
00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
RSA number that's where we reference
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
academic standards what you need to know
 
00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
okay with that adding it in there
 
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
academic standards it's it's it's what
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
reads I think the minimum standards do
 
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
contain reference to academic stat and
 
00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
Slater so we ought to have that
 
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:17.240 align:start position:0%
definition in the minimum standards for
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
public school
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
approval da you okay with that um I'm
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
so a is not new language is
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
it no but it's new to the I don't let's
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
see let's look see if it's in the old
 
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.910 align:start position:0%
see let's look see if it's in the old
standards

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
here no it's not they're adding it to
 
00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.509 align:start position:0%
here no it's not they're adding it to
the

00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:46.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
standards if you look at this book right
 
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.160 align:start position:0%
here the one which is right there from
 
00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:54.759 align:start position:0%
14 they're not listed in it okay so now
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
what they're saying we need to list that
 
00:13:56.639 --> 00:13:57.590 align:start position:0%
what they're saying we need to list that
in

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
the academic standards means academic
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
standards as defined in statute yeah so
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
I have no problem with that because
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
that's what's in statute okay we're good
 
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.230 align:start position:0%
that's what's in statute okay we're good
with

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
that okay the next one down
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement of achievement means
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
when a student has demonstrated
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
achievement of District competencies and
 
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
or grad graduation competencies
 
00:14:25.389 --> 00:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
consistent with rsa's 193c col
 
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
3 this is where I start getting gut AES
 
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
um we have this great discussion going
 
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
on regarding the words
 
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
proficiency Master
 
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:43.110 align:start position:0%
proficiency Master
competencies

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
um got to be
 
00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
careful I had done some work here on
 
00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:51.389 align:start position:0%
careful I had done some work here on
that

00:14:51.389 --> 00:14:51.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
um and this this is a
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
there so they're changing
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement of achievement to a
 
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
see what I had written If I Were King of
 
00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:36.759 align:start position:0%
the Heap here I'd write it something
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
like this acknowledgement of achievement
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
occurs when the student has demonstrated
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
Mastery of key content specific Concepts
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
skills and
 
00:15:50.189 --> 00:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge and that's pursuant to RSA 193
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
2 but I'm not King at
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
hate to me proficient means that yeah
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
you're okay you don't have you haven't
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
mastered it you don't have a complete
 
00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:07.959 align:start position:0%
understanding of it you just sort of
 
00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
have the basics that's what proficiency
 
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.030 align:start position:0%
 
stronger

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
stronger
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
proficiency and Mastery are different
 
00:16:22.829 --> 00:16:22.839 align:start position:0%
terms I I agree 100% Senator with you on
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
that you
 
00:16:28.269 --> 00:16:28.279 align:start position:0%
know is proficiency Mastery no
 
00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:30.839 align:start position:0%
performance level targets that lead to
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
Mastery we have levels of Mastery so you
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
have levels of proficiency as you're
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
um you look at the definition
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
competencies that's in RC 193 H1 why
 
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
don't we take a look there because they
 
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
there's a second sentence there
 
00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
underneath competencies which deals with
 
00:17:03.909 --> 00:17:03.919 align:start position:0%
Mastery you say 193 what
 
00:17:03.919 --> 00:17:05.470 align:start position:0%
Mastery you say 193 what
193

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:05.480 align:start position:0%
193
 
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.750 align:start position:0%
193
H

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
one I didn't bring my rigger one here so
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
here see it says competencies mean
 
00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:27.559 align:start position:0%
student learning targets that represent
 
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:33.799 align:start position:0%
and it goes on specific and required
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
types of compeny include District
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
competencies at grade level in in course
 
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
etc then if you if you got your books if
 
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
you're looking at that you can go over
 
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
to 193
 
00:17:57.149 --> 00:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
H1 d a the
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
purpose and you see in Roman 3 where it
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
says students best learn at their own
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
pace as they Master content and skills
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
allowing them to advance when they
 
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
Mastery so we we've done referencing to
 
00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:35.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
so um so Mr chair are you you suggesting
 
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
that the definition of competencies and
 
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
D should line up with the definition of
 
00:18:48.029 --> 00:18:48.039 align:start position:0%
competencies in 193
 
00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
H1 yeah if if if if we're going to have
 
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
it already in Statue of course we should
 
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
line it up yeah and you know and I think
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
that equate the word Mastery to if
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
you're going have your roof on the house
 
00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:03.799 align:start position:0%
repair you're going to look for a
 
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
master construction worker to put a roof
 
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
on because everything you own is
 
00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.789 align:start position:0%
on because everything you own is
underneath

00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
underneath
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
it proficient means there's different
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
levels of you can be proficient but not
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
a master at it right I think it's
 
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
important that we set the bar for every
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
kid as we want them all to try to
 
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:25.720 align:start position:0%
towards Mastery there will be on the
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
assessments different levels of
 
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
proficiency that we see some might below
 
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
some be some might be above proficient
 
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
above proficient is probably closer to
 
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
Mastery but Mastery of you have Mastery
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
of a course a course credit there are
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
courses that are embedded in a program
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
of studies like mathematics T Cal
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
algebra so you you can
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
Master algebra but doesn't necessarily
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
mean You' have mastered all your math
 
00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.950 align:start position:0%
mean You' have mastered all your math
right

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
right and and would it would it also be
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
fair to say that there are competencies
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
that that you would um and I want to
 
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
make sure I get the
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
right term um rep uh competencies that
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
you master within a within a course but
 
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's not to say that you've mastered
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
everything in the course right and I
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
think that's what competencies in a
 
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
definition we've been competencies means
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
you've attained these targets
 
00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
learning targets along the way so like a
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
flight path you have benchmarks along
 
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
the way targets M um Master is at the
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
end of that right but you may have
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
Mastery in that
 
00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
particular area within that course maybe
 
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
Grant you time
 
00:20:48.669 --> 00:20:48.679 align:start position:0%
Stables don't have achieved problem
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
solving yet they haven't apped them
 
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
right right
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
so I'm having difficulty with this uh
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
I'll be truthful with you I I think that
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
we're asking our teachers in the field
 
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
to really
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
start managing this thing down to the
 
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty and I can remember going
 
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
through this in the late 70s and the 80s
 
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
we had teachers spend more time
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
managing and checking all the boxes with
 
00:21:18.669 --> 00:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
little Susan Jones here is Master the 70
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
competencies associated with this and
 
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
less time
 
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
instruction MH and I think we're sliding
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
and are we going back and trying to
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
repeat exactly what we found we changed
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
that we had to get away from
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
that it's important that you as the
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
teacher have that in your head you're
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
certified to teach reading you know what
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
she doesn't have um and that's what
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
you're getting paid the big bucks to do
 
00:21:51.549 --> 00:21:51.559 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah magnificent instruction
 
00:21:51.559 --> 00:21:55.789 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah magnificent instruction
so

00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
um so that was acknowledgement of a che
 
00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:01.559 align:start position:0%
m not the definition of a competencies
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
on but um and they're changing to
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
competencies so you put in the D in here
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
right from the
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh that that the from
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
H1 is that the one you want uh on page
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
one of this thing here I I guess I'm
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
walking away from it a little bit and I
 
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
in looking I'd like to have
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement of achievement occurs
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
when the student has demonstrated
 
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
Mastery of a key content specific
 
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
Concepts skills and
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
knowledge uh that's echoing the RSA 193
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
there I mean what what happens when
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
there's um when there there is an
 
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
agreement between what's in a rule and
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
say that again please so like ju just
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
taking for example the definition of
 
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
competencies um it's defined in Statute
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
in each one and it's defined in rules
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
um totally
 
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
differently I guess I have a similar
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
question because there's no definition
 
00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:54.919 align:start position:0%
of achievement of competencies in
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
statute is there no it now it reads
 
00:24:02.909 --> 00:24:02.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
achievement and they're changing
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
achievement to
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
competencies or achievement of
 
00:24:26.909 --> 00:24:26.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
a well it's a achieving those learning
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
targets that represent a level of
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
Mastery and that's in the definition of
 
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.389 align:start position:0%
Mastery and that's in the definition of
Competency

00:24:38.389 --> 00:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.399 --> 00:24:44.389 align:start position:0%
 
level

00:24:44.389 --> 00:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:47.320 align:start position:0%
it's level of Mastery of content
 
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
specific concept skills and knowledge
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
so in the H1
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
definition um Mr chair it it talks about
 
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
um means student competency competencies
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
means student learning targets that
 
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
represent a level of Mastery so is
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
Mastery I think this a lot of levels of
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:39.149 --> 00:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
mean uh you can be proficient at a level
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
of one of these targeted areas that
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
leads to Mastery
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.389 --> 00:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
learning you're saying that as a as a as
 
00:25:50.399 --> 00:25:53.350 align:start position:0%
learning you're saying that as a as a as
a

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
practitioner being a former principal
 
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
and and superintendent
 
00:26:00.669 --> 00:26:00.679 align:start position:0%
and teacher and teacher but what what is
 
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
it what does it say in the rules and
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
statute well right now it says right we
 
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
have an acknowledgement of achievement
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
have oh
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
man acknowledgement of achievement means
 
00:26:17.549 --> 00:26:17.559 align:start position:0%
when a student has demonstrated
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
achievement of District competencies and
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
the state doesn't set District
 
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
competencies right you may establish the
 
00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:26.919 align:start position:0%
bar higher in Hopkinton and you set
 
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
and Andor graduation conferen is
 
00:26:36.389 --> 00:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
consistent with RSA 193
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
C3 the graduation diploma is issued by
 
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
state well except I know it except the
 
00:26:54.269 --> 00:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
the state can provide a certain number
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
of credits to that um towards that
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
competencies see what what there if if
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
you look at the sheet later on it deals
 
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.149 align:start position:0%
you look at the sheet later on it deals
with

00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
Mastery um on the sheet that I have and
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's one two 3 four five pages in
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
the same I guess they're the same on the
 
00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
bottom there it's highlighted under
 
00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:00.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
Mastery means a high level of
 
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
demonstrated proficiency with regard to
 
00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:11.110 align:start position:0%
demonstrated proficiency with regard to
ACC

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
competency so um Mr chair yeah just um
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
because I think at at this rate we will
 
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
be here forever um and may maybe maybe
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
what just a suggestion um as far as
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
accomplishment for today is just go
 
00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:30.919 align:start position:0%
through the side by side and you know
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
what we don't have to comment on any of
 
00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
things just just try to understand
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
what's what's in front of
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
us and we can go through the side by
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
side and um
 
00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.430 align:start position:0%
side and um
and

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think that we need to have a
 
00:28:47.789 --> 00:28:47.799 align:start position:0%
thorough discussion this competencies
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
proficiency and Mastery with the
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
department and
 
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
and and Ure
 
00:28:59.310 --> 00:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
that I I I just think we're just on the
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
verge of moving things around totally in
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
terms of Education here I think we got
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
to be very careful yeah because
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
traditionally I believe in the
 
00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
traditional meaning of competencies that
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
it's the knowledge skills Concepts and
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
work study practices that are required
 
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
to achieve a desired level of
 
00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
Mastery other words I look at that high
 
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
bar and then you have different levels
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
of proficiency along the way of getting
 
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
there or even a high proficiency when
 
00:29:29.549 --> 00:29:29.559 align:start position:0%
you achieve that m master I think that's
 
00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:32.039 align:start position:0%
exactly what is saying on the fifth page
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
here uh commenters request that
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
proficiency be changed to
 
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
Mastery definition of Mastery and
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
current rules Mastery means the student
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
performance required to achieve at least
 
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
stuff and so are you going to have a
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
teacher now figure out okay what kind of
 
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
instrument are you going to give me to
 
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
assume that that child makes
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
85% mhm in a simple Mastery of how to
 
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
consonant we need to have a discussion
 
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
with them and we need to figure out
 
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
where we're going with
 
00:30:22.509 --> 00:30:22.519 align:start position:0%
this I know the the third party that was
 
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
contracted is moving wants to move in
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
that competency Direction
 
00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:31.039 align:start position:0%
maybe good idea I don't know but we
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
we've been doing that for the last
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
years I think that contract got extended
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
another year today oh really yeah oh
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
executive Council into 2025 yeah well
 
00:30:48.909 --> 00:30:48.919 align:start position:0%
that's because these rules have a 10e
 
00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
25 that's what I would assume okay let's
 
00:30:57.149 --> 00:30:57.159 align:start position:0%
move on now then so put question mark
 
00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
there by that
 
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
right there and we need to discuss this
 
00:31:06.629 --> 00:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
MH uh Career and Technical education
 
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
means organize educational activities
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
that and then lists them
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
um that right there has been revised
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
language to reflect the existing
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:30.269 --> 00:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
removed the and the way that's in law if
 
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
you if you look at that RS say 188
 
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
e23 you can see that they're using part
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.149 --> 00:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
409 see it says current technical
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
education or CTE means organized
 
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
educational activities that then you
 
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
have an
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
a well a one and a two under and three
 
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:24.200 align:start position:0%
underneath a and a b is that all part of
 
00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.669 align:start position:0%
underneath a and a b is that all part of
the

00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
definition I would say yes too with it
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
they're not putting it all in there so
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
they're removing all that they're
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
um um yeah they're removing it they're
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
removing it all of
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
it they're removing it but they're
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
referencing the statue that's not okay
 
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
by me either Patty it's this is forer
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
attack yeah well they remove it but they
 
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
reference the statute
 
00:33:16.269 --> 00:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
all if they if they're going to do that
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
would they have to put after Roman
 
00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:25.070 align:start position:0%
would they have to put after Roman
3

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
3
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
A 1 2 3 B
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
b or can you do it reference to just
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
could but they say they're removing
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
it well they're REM langu to reflect
 
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
existing statutory definition okay yeah
 
00:33:49.149 --> 00:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to keep it in they would
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
reference the a one 2 3 and b i they
 
00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.120 align:start position:0%
would have to reference it up here you
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
can see the jail car recommendation yeah
 
00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
term or CTE Career Technical education
 
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.389 align:start position:0%
term or CTE Career Technical education
or

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:34:10.399 --> 00:34:12.589 align:start position:0%
or
CTE

00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:12.599 align:start position:0%
CTE
 
00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:14.919 align:start position:0%
okay okay I guess if they're going to
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
have referencing the RSA I'm good with
 
00:34:16.879 --> 00:34:35.710 align:start position:0%
have referencing the RSA I'm good with
that

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to keep us in the
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
present you're going to keep us in the
 
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
present statue yeah
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
so we'll just reference that statute and
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
and then it would take everything right
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:56.030 align:start position:0%
 
here

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
okay want to go on next one
 
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:06.750 align:start position:0%
okay want to go on next one
yeah

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.750 align:start position:0%
 
Readiness

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
Readiness
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
that's in the
 
00:35:44.349 --> 00:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
out any problem with taking that out
 
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
I honestly don't know where um where
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
where is it in the current rules it's
 
00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:11.870 align:start position:0%
where is it in the current rules it's
right

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
where they're taking it
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
out right here if you look at
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
it we have a copy of this um we should
 
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
have a copy of that that's when I I'll
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
see if I have any other copies in the
 
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:40.710 align:start position:0%
see if I have any other copies in the
office

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.670 align:start position:0%
 
first

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
you we keep that down there I don't have
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
any others com off well we we can we can
 
00:37:29.309 --> 00:37:29.319 align:start position:0%
pass it pass sit along you just send it
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
down to Patty I I I guess I guess the
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
question I would ask is why is it why is
 
00:37:33.359 --> 00:37:34.270 align:start position:0%
question I would ask is why is it why is
it

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
out well you know the
 
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
the the first question would be why is
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
it in there now and if College and
 
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
Career Readiness as a term is used
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the rules yeah then it
 
00:37:50.349 --> 00:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
makes sense to have it defined yeah if
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's not used elsewhere in the rul it
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:03.069 --> 00:38:03.079 align:start position:0%
but if if somehow it was used elsewhere
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
in the current rules and then that was
 
00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:06.750 align:start position:0%
in the current rules and then that was
taken

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
taken
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
out you know yeah when I that would be
 
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
concerning when I reviewed this earlier
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
I jumped over that it didn't give me a
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
lot of heartburn there the next one down
 
00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
yeah and I would just say on that one we
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
need to keep it as it's in statute right
 
00:38:27.119 --> 00:38:31.829 align:start position:0%
need to keep it as it's in statute right
now

00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
is that d That's D yeah or else we're
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
going to have then the ru making
 
00:38:37.839 --> 00:38:41.030 align:start position:0%
going to have then the ru making
superseding

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.390 align:start position:0%
 
statute

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:38:51.069 --> 00:38:51.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
says everybody just good with keeping
 
00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
that y okay okay the next one down is
 
00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:57.599 --> 00:40:41.829 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
well that's another one where I sort of
 
00:40:46.589 --> 00:40:46.599 align:start position:0%
rewrote it
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
myself I wrote down and I'm echoing
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
what's in 193 H colon 1- a
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
on the purpose for performance and
 
00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:05.079 align:start position:0%
accountability so it's 193 H col one-
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
a and I wrote down students best learn
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
at their own pace as they Master content
 
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
and skills allowing them to advance when
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
the when they demonstrate the desired
 
00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:24.670 align:start position:0%
the when they demonstrate the desired
level

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:26.839 align:start position:0%
Mastery competencies they have
 
00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
measured can you imagine what we're
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
going to have to
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
do on every subject we have there's
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
going to be competencies and how are you
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
going to measure
 
00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
it it's not going to be the teacher now
 
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
saying I've been trained to do that and
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
I recognize this child can
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
read but you're going to have to have
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
some kind of measure and it's going to
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
Box wasn't written by classroom teachers
 
00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
know so you know students students want
 
00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
to learn different things and become
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
really good at some things maybe not
 
00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
everything mhm you know and and you know
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
for example you know I spent a lot of
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
time in math and science classes you I
 
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
just really enjoyed that stuff and U and
 
00:42:40.109 --> 00:42:40.119 align:start position:0%
you know I took the art classes that
 
00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
that I had to take and I wish I'd
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
probably taken some more MH but but um
 
00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
but to say that you got to move on when
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
85% I mean that's you know where how
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
does that cutline work for everybody
 
00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
particularly if if if I really want to
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
be a fine arts major in college and I
 
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
want to take everything my you know I
 
00:43:09.309 --> 00:43:09.319 align:start position:0%
you know you know I I'd spend all day in
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
could you know it and you're going to
 
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
have to measure that with some kind of
 
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
an instrument let's say we're talking
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
about ancient history and we're talking
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
about the fall of the Byzantine Empire
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
14 00 and
 
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
something I as a teacher am not going to
 
00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:35.720 align:start position:0%
expect my students to remember that date
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not remembering it right now but I
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
would like them to learn something why
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
the Byzantine empire fell and why that
 
00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
might be relative to something that's
 
00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
going on in today's world um that's the
 
00:43:50.829 --> 00:43:50.839 align:start position:0%
important part I'm trying to get them to
 
00:43:50.839 --> 00:43:52.510 align:start position:0%
important part I'm trying to get them to
think

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
logically and I think that we could get
 
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
off track here if the measurement that
 
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
time yeah yeah yeah if if your takeaway
 
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
is the date the empire fell or why did
 
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
The Empire yeah fall the why is much
 
00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
more important yeah yeah and the ability
 
00:44:17.349 --> 00:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
the of what's the purpose for teaching
 
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
that you're trying to get the kids to
 
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
think you don't want them just scooting
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
off of nowhere yes but you want them
 
00:44:26.829 --> 00:44:26.839 align:start position:0%
thinking and thinking asking the
 
00:44:28.589 --> 00:44:28.599 align:start position:0%
question questions making those
 
00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
inferences and analyzing the data so you
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
can know how to do that when the barbery
 
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
Pirates did their thing again with the
 
00:44:38.549 --> 00:44:38.559 align:start position:0%
USS Constitution and then they did it
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
since when Gaddafi did his thing so does
 
00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:44.079 align:start position:0%
history repeat yes it does that's what I
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
want to teach them and we can have we
 
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
can learn from her past all the whys and
 
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm just I I
 
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
guess I think if you're right about
 
00:44:58.829 --> 00:44:58.839 align:start position:0%
something you have a question you have
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
to write and explain something that's
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
takes much more time and much more
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
insight than if you just answer a bunch
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
of questions including the dates yeah
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
100% in some of these classes you judge
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
whether they know it by whether they can
 
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
do it they apply that
 
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
skill replace the spark PL then you
 
00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
don't do that anymore do you replace a
 
00:45:31.549 --> 00:45:31.559 align:start position:0%
spark plug oh yeah yeah you don't do
 
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
that anymore cars are different David
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
when you said move on do you mean that
 
00:45:38.349 --> 00:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
you have taken X number of courses in
 
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:39.640 align:start position:0%
this particular thing and now you have
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
to do something different well that's
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
what it's that's what it's saying here
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
in the in at the top of um page three in
 
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
the side by side students advance to Lo
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
proficiency I mean I I'm just sort of
 
00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:00.200 align:start position:0%
like taking that as as proficiency being
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
85% of Mastery and what if I want to
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
right I think that's a problem with
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
schooling very often that you don't have
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
the chance to really go into the Weeds
 
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
on one particular subject right you have
 
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
to do these other things as well because
 
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:25.240 align:start position:0%
you need so many credits and this and so
 
00:46:28.349 --> 00:46:28.359 align:start position:0%
many credits and that uh yeah and that
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
depends on the that that depends on the
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
high school right um you know if you've
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
if you've got I mean what what do we
 
00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.349 align:start position:0%
if you've got I mean what what do we
require

00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
18 20 20 20 credits but some some are 22
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
right right but not all of them are
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
prescriptive to um to certain courses so
 
00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
so schools that have a lot of electives
 
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
and less prescriptive you can really
 
00:46:58.589 --> 00:46:58.599 align:start position:0%
dive deep into art classes or or you
 
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
um if you look further down into 193 h1a
 
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 5 it talks about the
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
flexibility and in learning compet
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
Competency Based strategies provide
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
flexibility in the way that credit can
 
00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
be earned and awarded and provide
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
students with personalized
 
00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
learning I think that I think that's on
 
00:47:28.109 --> 00:47:28.119 align:start position:0%
P 581 581 I think addresses what you're
 
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
talking about representative luno yeah
 
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:35.390 align:start position:0%
talking about representative luno yeah
yeah

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
um what did you say H5 page
 
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
five page 581 Roman numeral 5 oh in the
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
it's yeah 193 h one-
 
00:47:57.549 --> 00:47:57.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's that that is what
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
I'm what I'm um looking for and I'm
 
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
just you know is the rule consistent
 
00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
rules sounds like the rules are trying
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
to they're trying to replicate statute
 
00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.109 align:start position:0%
to they're trying to replicate statute
which

00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:48:28.109 --> 00:48:28.119 align:start position:0%
these statutes been around a long time
 
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
has well I guess what what I'm what I'm
 
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
taking exception to is on the on the
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
proposed rules on page three in the in
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
the first um um the middle cell on the
 
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
side by side students advance to new
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
learning opportunities upon proficiency
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
and if I think we saw proficiency is
 
00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:01.720 align:start position:0%
defined at 85% of
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
Mastery um I'm just why why are why are
 
00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities all good questions maybe I
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
want to stay in that in this learning
 
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity you can find your GI is not
 
00:49:19.789 --> 00:49:19.799 align:start position:0%
going to want to get out until they have
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
all their answers answer might they
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
might want to stay in high school
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
forever if you're not they can't do that
 
00:49:28.789 --> 00:49:28.799 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
but but they may want to stay in the art
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
can so which page are you on right now I
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
where I
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
am yeah I was on yeah the side by side
 
00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
page three top middle cell well I don't
 
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
think that necessarily means that they
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
have to move on to another class they
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
might just move on to another skill in
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
the same class that they're currently
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I I agree with you but I'm
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
just wondering it's
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's sort of not it's not clear are
 
00:50:05.549 --> 00:50:05.559 align:start position:0%
we trying to thread the
 
00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:07.559 align:start position:0%
needle I don't know what we're trying to
 
00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
do you see this this I think we're
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
getting into education ease this this
 
00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.910 align:start position:0%
getting into education ease this this
language

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:50:20.589 --> 00:50:20.599 align:start position:0%
that 95% of the world don't understand
 
00:50:20.599 --> 00:50:23.549 align:start position:0%
that 95% of the world don't understand
it

00:50:23.549 --> 00:50:23.559 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:25.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I actually think we're getting down
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
into the weeds of what the teacher is
 
00:50:31.549 --> 00:50:31.559 align:start position:0%
supposed to actually be doing by using
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
these or the curriculum providers the
 
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum planners whoever's
 
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
determining the curriculum for the
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
schools this is what they're supposed to
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
be doing based on the rules that we give
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
them so worrying about what when the
 
00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
students actually move
 
00:50:50.589 --> 00:50:50.599 align:start position:0%
along might be getting too out of our
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
scope I I that that's what I'm saying
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
yeah we're getting down Lo to the
 
00:50:58.990 --> 00:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
teacher oh so you're saying this is too
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
prescriptive very prescriptive yeah very
 
00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so that was what definition
 
00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
was that we were on competencies no no
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
we went by that uh that's the it's the
 
00:51:23.599 --> 00:51:25.190 align:start position:0%
we went by that uh that's the it's the
um

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:28.789 --> 00:51:28.799 align:start position:0%
sorry oh that is competencies yeah okay
 
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
we were talking about competencies yeah
 
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.789 align:start position:0%
 
prescriptive

00:51:40.789 --> 00:51:40.799 align:start position:0%
prescriptive
 
00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh comp competencies are explicitly
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
stated and
 
00:51:59.069 --> 00:51:59.079 align:start position:0%
measured EXP itly
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
stated so we're going to have to have
 
00:52:03.789 --> 00:52:03.799 align:start position:0%
curriculum writers go through
 
00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:09.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:13.549 --> 00:52:13.559 align:start position:0%
competencies and having the method
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
to assess yeah yeah no Dave gave me a
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
booklet on conquered High School a
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
listing of all the courses and all the
 
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
programs offered and the requirement
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
graduation require well
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
done and I think that's 90% making sure
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
the parents know and kids know and the
 
00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
track they're going to be on and then
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
then the teacher would teach that and
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about geometry one
 
00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
or whatever then it's now that math
 
00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
teacher that has a credential to along
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
with our academic standards and later on
 
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
this report you say where are the
 
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
academic standards I've yet I don't know
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
where academic standards really are I
 
00:52:59.670 --> 00:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
don't we haven't mhm but at any rate
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's then up to the teacher knowing here
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
the academic standards and hopefully
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
there's the Frameworks curriculum
 
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
Frameworks serve as a guide I can
 
00:53:13.109 --> 00:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
instruction and measure my
 
00:53:17.789 --> 00:53:17.799 align:start position:0%
instruction unless we're going to get
 
00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
into what they did in the old days
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
Criterion reference test where the
 
00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
district develops her own curriculum
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
tests for each subject area those didn't
 
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
last long seeing that you had to have a
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
bank of questions a mile long so it
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
year I think everything has competency
 
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
we need to have a discussion with the
 
00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
on a course of study
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
means progression of competencies
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
they have of course the study means a
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
progression of related competencies
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
leading to
 
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
graduation I think that should stay as
 
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
credit if they want to change the
 
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
definition because the related
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
competencies would be part of one course
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
credit that would then with the credits
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
so yeah I mean we're sort of if you look
 
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
at that book right there the old book da
 
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
the next several pages in this show
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
you they you see how courses are spelled
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
out there in that table courses with
 
00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
program areas or study programs yeah so
 
00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
within a program of Economics you may
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
have some courses which are offered the
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
high school right now according to this
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
stat rule has to have 40 at least 43
 
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
courses in their syllabus MH
 
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
and the the
 
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
courses are the you can have
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
competencies and you could have you
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
could have Mastery of that course
 
00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
material or be proficient but they're
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
all leading towards the graduation
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
requirement where you have to have three
 
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
credits of this to graduate which is on
 
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
the next page with some of those tables
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
right the total of 20 credit so high
 
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
school that requires 24 credits for
 
00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
graduation um would have uh well even
 
00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
electives so a student would be able to
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
apply those six to any of these courses
 
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
so here's the
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
I wrote trying to think how this could
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
be written I wrote
 
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
down a course of study is a unit of
 
00:56:37.309 --> 00:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
teaching within a program of offerings
 
00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
necessary to meet the requirements for
 
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
for attaining graduation
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
competencies so it's a course of
 
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
study is a unit of teaching within a
 
00:56:50.029 --> 00:56:50.039 align:start position:0%
program of offerings well it's it's it's
 
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
really a course within yeah
 
00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
it's again we're I think we're trying to
 
00:56:58.910 --> 00:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
identify the nitty I I want to find that
 
00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:01.400 align:start position:0%
conquered High School um U program
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
studies that you that that underneath
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
the chair where I do my work in in in
 
00:57:08.029 --> 00:57:08.039 align:start position:0%
the dining room okay well no I think I
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
brought a stack of them in here though
 
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I think we've got some on
 
00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
the bookshelf and they did a good job of
 
00:57:17.029 --> 00:57:17.039 align:start position:0%
this Terry wolf um had a lot to do with
 
00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:19.839 align:start position:0%
that and and to me that really lays out
 
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
makes it very clear what a program of
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
studies are is if I want to go into an
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
Allied Health field
 
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
um the the conquered High School um uh
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
course guide says for this program of
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
for this program these are the courses
 
00:57:37.599 --> 00:57:39.510 align:start position:0%
for this program these are the courses
you

00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:57:42.029 --> 00:57:42.039 align:start position:0%
take you see and this is part of what
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
came out of conquer right here I wrote
 
00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
down for graduation competencies means
 
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
minimum credits and specific
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
competencies required for graduation
 
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
across a district that meet local and
 
00:57:56.549 --> 00:57:56.559 align:start position:0%
state learning expectations
 
00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
that came out of that conquer High
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
School I think we ought to Echo some of
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
the stuff in the field Manchester does
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
it too I'm just looking in in they have
 
00:58:08.029 --> 00:58:08.039 align:start position:0%
pathway business marketing management
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
paway electives you know um possible job
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities it even tells them in the
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
course of studies what jobs they could
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
get if they go through that
 
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
so you see that's what we have to have
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
those Pathways the course of studies is
 
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
that requirements to attain that career
 
00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
skill you're going after within that
 
00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
pathway they have these programs set up
 
00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you did you get one
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
yeah they did a very nice job
 
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
on what I was looking
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
at on in this thing it was
 
00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
on pages six and
 
00:58:57.549 --> 00:58:57.559 align:start position:0%
seven where they have graduation credit
 
00:59:04.029 --> 00:59:04.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.029 --> 00:59:06.039 align:start position:0%
requirements and there's some language
 
00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:07.839 align:start position:0%
in there which could be borrowed and
 
00:59:13.309 --> 00:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
work so you
 
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
know I think we need to put a question
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
mark by this one
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
too and maybe should be reflective on
 
00:59:29.069 --> 00:59:29.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
course of studies where am I here so
 
00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
that would probably apply to
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
mhm yeah in next one down where they
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
have H curriculum that should be the
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
definition right there in a statute MH
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
differentiation that's
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
no is it needed
 
01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:24.510 align:start position:0%
no is it needed
differentiation

01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
just adjustment is made to learning
 
01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:33.069 align:start position:0%
just adjustment is made to learning
opportunities

01:00:33.069 --> 01:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
similar I don't know I guess if you ask
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
five people to tell us when I met we get
 
01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
five different answers there they're
 
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
right I mean it's sort of U how is it
 
01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
on I don't know if we've got anything
 
01:00:57.870 --> 01:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
that's searchable
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
well you know I looked at their
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
definition here to learning
 
01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities for groups of Learners it
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
could be an individual too for an
 
01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:07.640 align:start position:0%
individual or
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
groups of
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
Learners based upon learning
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
needs I wouldn't put similar in there
 
01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:19.960 align:start position:0%
based on learning needs often times when
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
you have to differentiate it's because
 
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
there is a need to get off the path and
 
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
do another way
 
01:01:29.029 --> 01:01:29.039 align:start position:0%
teachers do that learning style and
 
01:01:29.039 --> 01:01:33.390 align:start position:0%
teachers do that learning style and
teaching

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
styles but at very least I think we need
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
to really address that that's not just
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
for groups of Learners it can be for an
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
individual too individual or groups of
 
01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
Learners based on learning
 
01:01:50.029 --> 01:01:50.039 align:start position:0%
needs I think they're doing because in
 
01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
groups you want everybody in the same
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
group for a similar
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
need but
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
so it's used in two other places in the
 
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
on on page
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
43 and it talks about individualization
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
through third so the printing on our
 
01:02:50.109 --> 01:02:50.119 align:start position:0%
paper is different than the pdf version
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
of this I was going to say mine shows it
 
01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:55.640 align:start position:0%
on 42 and 46 yeah yeah okay okay you're
 
01:02:55.640 --> 01:03:14.910 align:start position:0%
on 42 and 46 yeah yeah okay okay you're
good

01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
yeah well I I I don't I'm not really
 
01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
getting a heartburn on it but I'd like
 
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
to see it open up to in a smaller school
 
01:03:23.789 --> 01:03:23.799 align:start position:0%
you're going to do it for an individual
 
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
not necessar a group M or you may do it
 
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
even large school you might have a
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
student that's come in
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
knows or Manchester with 58 different
 
01:03:42.119 --> 01:03:45.390 align:start position:0%
knows or Manchester with 58 different
languages

01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.029 --> 01:03:48.039 align:start position:0%
yeah ready to go
 
01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:05.789 --> 01:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
are you back on three yeah yeah they're
 
01:04:05.799 --> 01:04:08.430 align:start position:0%
are you back on three yeah yeah they're
removing

01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
it I don't know why because we do have
 
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:15.670 align:start position:0%
it I don't know why because we do have
District

01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
offering above and beyond or they I dare
 
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:21.640 align:start position:0%
say that the competencies that one
 
01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
district has fors competencies in
 
01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
another district for the same course
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
might be different
 
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
because the state's not writing these
 
01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
compes the local is unless the state
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:38.839 align:start position:0%
this if we're going to do it better find
 
01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
well isn't that a problem though if you
 
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
have different districts have different
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
competencies so if you go one school you
 
01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
learn something one way and if you move
 
01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
somewhere else it's going to be
 
01:04:57.789 --> 01:04:57.799 align:start position:0%
different different and it seems to me
 
01:04:59.789 --> 01:04:59.799 align:start position:0%
there should be something overarching
 
01:05:03.549 --> 01:05:03.559 align:start position:0%
that basic stuff is the same
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
everywhere you're never going to get
 
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
that you know there's some places that
 
01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
in Patty's school they might teach us
 
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
history in the eighth grade and days
 
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
they may do it in the ninth grade your
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
school they may wait and do that in 11th
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
grade so then you give the
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
accountability test at one level if it's
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
done at the level you're teaching it or
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
the preceding year you might your kids
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
might do well if kids haven't had it yet
 
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to fail it so so these are
 
01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.910 align:start position:0%
they're going to fail it so so these are
done

01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
locally so I might want to pick a school
 
01:05:37.269 --> 01:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
that teach us the way I want it yeah
 
01:05:37.279 --> 01:05:38.549 align:start position:0%
that teach us the way I want it yeah
this

01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
sequence that's why we have the
 
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity for when a kid comes into
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
school we've had this discussion on the
 
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
education commit here often where the
 
01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:47.349 align:start position:0%
education commit here often where the
receiving

01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
school the principal will make a
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
decision whether they're going to accept
 
01:05:54.269 --> 01:05:54.279 align:start position:0%
that credit or that credit coming in or
 
01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
that course coming in
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
if there's a question then you can take
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
out your competency test and administer
 
01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
that to the kid and if they do well they
 
01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
get credit for the
 
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
course okay but I can remember as
 
01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock was objecting to that
 
01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
the whole premise what we're doing just
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
leave it the way it
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:21.549 --> 01:06:21.559 align:start position:0%
um I I think they ought leave this
 
01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
District's competencies in I don't know
 
01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:31.870 --> 01:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
there's District competencies there's
 
01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:37.230 align:start position:0%
there's District competencies there's
graduation

01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
competencies are they saying across one
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
District or across all districts Common
 
01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
across the district I I take that like
 
01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
Manchester so that they're teaching the
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
same thing because kids move around
 
01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.190 align:start position:0%
same thing because kids move around
from

01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
school make sure they're talking about
 
01:06:57.870 --> 01:06:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
I I don't want that
 
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
removed yeah if you took that out you
 
01:07:05.549 --> 01:07:05.559 align:start position:0%
could have a problem East and West
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
yeah we have four different high schools
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
keep educator
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:43.789 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:07:43.789 --> 01:07:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
okay revised language to ensure
 
01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
consistency with educator credential
 
01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:53.079 align:start position:0%
division are state regulations
 
01:07:56.269 --> 01:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
Reed the most I'm okay to ensure
 
01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
consistency by the educator
 
01:08:04.349 --> 01:08:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:07.069 --> 01:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
definition so in the in the proposed
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
definition in k um on the second column
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
U are these
 
01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
all certifi yeah but are these all
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:29.000 align:start position:0%

01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
before so why not just say an educator
 
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
is anybody that's credential by the
 
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
state board ofed education yeah and take
 
01:08:59.910 --> 01:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
all the in between stuff out yeah
 
01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:02.759 align:start position:0%
because K isn't really saying that yeah
 
01:09:02.759 --> 01:09:04.829 align:start position:0%
because K isn't really saying that yeah
K

01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
K
 
01:09:08.189 --> 01:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
K's yeah K's not saying
 
01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
that because we have certain some Paras
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
are credentialed some are
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
not um depending upon what they're doing
 
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
so I would leave that up to Steve
 
01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
applebe to make that decision he's doing
 
01:09:26.749 --> 01:09:26.759 align:start position:0%
it his bureau is to department is doing
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
that I would write it educator means any
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
individual credential by the State Board
 
01:09:32.239 --> 01:09:48.030 align:start position:0%
individual credential by the State Board
of

01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:52.269 --> 01:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
Education so is an uh just to um you
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
know poke on this a little bit is an ed
 
01:09:58.590 --> 01:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.830 align:start position:0%
 
superintendent

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
administrator well no just going with
 
01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
your definition yeah Rick
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:17.149 --> 01:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
Ed we have it where principales and
 
01:10:20.110 --> 01:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
administrators are considered teachers
 
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere in law I can't remember where
 
01:10:25.709 --> 01:10:25.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
hey I I have I don't think it's a big
 
01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
enough thing to get hung up on yeah I
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
don't either and but there but you know
 
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
an administrator doesn't fall under the
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
think well that's why I would say
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
Educators means any individuals
 
01:10:52.830 --> 01:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
Education so then how how's the word
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
educator used in in here can or can
 
01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
Educators do any you
 
01:11:03.709 --> 01:11:03.719 align:start position:0%
know this is a type of thing that
 
01:11:08.189 --> 01:11:08.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
rule yeah yeah I think it is yeah like
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
like we have it in law that
 
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
superintendents have these
 
01:11:23.229 --> 01:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
principles we're getting a little bit
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
out of our domain to our
 
01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of academic standards
 
01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so want to belabor this anymore
 
01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:39.639 align:start position:0%
this one I like the definition you posed
 
01:11:41.149 --> 01:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
but I think let's come back to it when
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
we take a look at how educator gets
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
used well it's something we can throw
 
01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
back at them and then have them explain
 
01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay next one
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
they took out the term also includes
 
01:12:54.120 --> 01:13:01.390 align:start position:0%
they took out the term also includes
equitable

01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
change I don't know why do we need that
 
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
I was going to say isn't it similar to
 
01:13:20.110 --> 01:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
differentiation that definition
 
01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
adjustments made to learning
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities for groups of Learners
 
01:13:24.910 --> 01:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
based on that and they're talking about
 
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
grp groupings of
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
individuals in equity it seems like the
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
same thing differentiation seems to
 
01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
cover what they're trying to do here
 
01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:39.590 align:start position:0%
cover what they're trying to do here
with

01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:42.189 --> 01:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
Equity I mean
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
if every student is required to have
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
free and
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh appropriate public education then
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
equity so they're talking about a kid
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
that's let's see not being placed at the
 
01:14:32.910 --> 01:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
level that they need to be placed at
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
because they have already accomplished
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
these skills and knowledge on level two
 
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
or three and yet they're in class three
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
or level three but they should be really
 
01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
getting four now is that Equity when
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
they're not providing that opportunity
 
01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
for competency for that
 
01:14:51.709 --> 01:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
child being held back rather than going
 
01:14:54.149 --> 01:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
forward I mean I think that I think that
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
could be and actually
 
01:14:57.629 --> 01:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
and and I I think what Katie was talking
 
01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
about could be e could be Equity too but
 
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
but I think also if you've got a student
 
01:15:07.149 --> 01:15:07.159 align:start position:0%
that is um that has has trouble hearing
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
having a classroom that has a um you
 
01:15:14.189 --> 01:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
know audio FM system that that makes um
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh makes it easier to
 
01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
teacher and providing students that that
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
have um difficult time hearing with the
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
inequity so then why are is that child
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
getting referred for special
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
services I don't know
 
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we're widening these rules
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
out but notice JL car's um comment on
 
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:56.189 --> 01:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
interesting to individuals or groups of
 
01:15:58.030 --> 01:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
individuals based on their identified
 
01:15:59.950 --> 01:15:59.960 align:start position:0%
needs in order to adjust for
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
non-achievement of competencies for
 
01:16:05.709 --> 01:16:05.719 align:start position:0%
other barriers to
 
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
success it's all coming down to this
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
competencies thing it's you know so if a
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
kids not place where they
 
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
they they they guess they've reflected
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
car want to go on Beyond this or leave
 
01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
it yeah I'm I'm going to circle the the
 
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
Jael car piece because I think maybe um
 
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
maybe just eliminating the definition
 
01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
obviously if they're following the
 
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
competencies some of that wouldn't
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it has to be out outside
 
01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
the classroom could be in the classroom
 
01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
too or in the school I don't know
 
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
through means outside the
 
01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
classroom I don't know why I think the
 
01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
the the current rule uses that type of
 
01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
yeah so so Rick going back to com just
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
going back to competencies in general
 
01:18:36.669 --> 01:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
yeah is there a list of competencies
 
01:18:42.270 --> 01:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
that that lead to graduation or is it
 
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
courses or El you know courses that lead
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
to graduation each of those courses has
 
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
competencies yeah that that that latter
 
01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
part you said is correct there there's
 
01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:55.750 align:start position:0%
part you said is correct there there's
courses

01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
courses
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
that are part of a program area a
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
program of study like you know and you
 
01:19:05.070 --> 01:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
have to have X number
 
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
credits for graduation in each of those
 
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
areas including I think six electives or
 
01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
so yeah and so and an ELO could be an
 
01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
elective yes or it could be or it could
 
01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
required see this is getting a little
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
bit into where Patty's involved with
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
Career Technical education where we've
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
now allowed provided that if there's an
 
01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
agreement between the sending district
 
01:19:45.070 --> 01:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
and the CTE the board and the
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
CTE that through that CTE program you
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
could get credit for chemistry if those
 
01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
competencies established by the local
 
01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
District are immersed into the program
 
01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:00.639 align:start position:0%
at the CTE Center that's in law right
 
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
now right but it would have to be all of
 
01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.830 align:start position:0%
now right but it would have to be all of
those

01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
competencies we it's been set up by this
 
01:20:08.709 --> 01:20:08.719 align:start position:0%
for the CTE that as long as during the
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
course of study in that program M they
 
01:20:13.870 --> 01:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
may not get all the competencies within
 
01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
this one course over there they may get
 
01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
it in another course at the CT Center
 
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
but they're going to end up with all the
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
comp compes for that credit M I think
 
01:20:25.550 --> 01:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
it's a great idea that saves
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation MH
 
01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm I'm not going to get hung
 
01:20:34.350 --> 01:20:34.360 align:start position:0%
up on that
 
01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
either that allows for achievement of
 
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
compeny through means outside the
 
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
classroom I think just the word allows
 
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
means that you don't have to but if you
 
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:51.070 --> 01:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
okay you have a a choice an opportunity
 
01:21:07.149 --> 01:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:09.790 --> 01:21:09.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know yeah I've been I can
 
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
remember that when I was in Alaska I had
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
this family that had this large Schooner
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
and they went around the world MH and
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
they want to know could we take our
 
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
child with us and we laid out what he
 
01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
was going to get navigation and
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
Mathematics and weather and and
 
01:21:32.629 --> 01:21:32.639 align:start position:0%
geography and all that and it came out
 
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
that following this and Reporting in
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
accordance with how we set it up kid was
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
going to get credit and through that
 
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
experience so that was an Extended
 
01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:44.270 align:start position:0%
experience so that was an Extended
Learning

01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
Learning
 
01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity I think we have we've been
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
doing this for for years and years and
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
years oh yeah it's nothing new it may be
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
ear that Alternative Learning learn
 
01:21:59.310 --> 01:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
everywhere M probably is but private
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
instruction independent study
 
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
internships that's something for example
 
01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
the kids at Lisbon are doing with New
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
England wire right now they're going in
 
01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:10.639 align:start position:0%
and getting some of that mathematics on
 
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
the floor of New England wire you should
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
see that plan up there they're building
 
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
a huge wing on it they're they're
 
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
selling stuff in France right now this
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's fine
 
01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships I don't know if you need
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
all those things listed underneath it
 
01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
but oh they took all those out yeah oh
 
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
good is that okay with everybody M okay
 
01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:49.110 align:start position:0%
good is that okay with everybody M okay
let's

01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:04.199 --> 01:23:22.310 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
why I guess why was it in there before
 
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:40.719 align:start position:0%
used graduation competencies say 59
 
01:23:40.719 --> 01:24:14.149 align:start position:0%
used graduation competencies say 59
references

01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
well lot this doesn't have anything to
 
01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
standards want to jump by this one
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
graduation competencies I I have a
 
01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
question mark I'm wondering why they
 
01:24:31.629 --> 01:24:31.639 align:start position:0%
want to take it out yeah I think it's a
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
well they've taken it out every it seems
 
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
like in most of the places it's used
 
01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
too and it's
 
01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
um I would say some of the graduation
 
01:24:45.149 --> 01:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
competencies that conquered High have
 
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
school and they may have more
 
01:24:55.229 --> 01:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
requirements for graduation then another
 
01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:17.030 align:start position:0%
 
out

01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
individualization see it gets pretty
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
when you get in this
 
01:25:23.109 --> 01:25:23.119 align:start position:0%
individualization trying to Define that
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:29.310 --> 01:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
as I'm jumping through the search it
 
01:25:31.629 --> 01:25:31.639 align:start position:0%
shows that oh let's see what page is
 
01:25:34.350 --> 01:25:34.360 align:start position:0%
this page 11 graduation competencies the
 
01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
note the commentary shows that it was
 
01:25:38.109 --> 01:25:38.119 align:start position:0%
removed and replaced with graduation
 
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
competencies in the new 8306 point21 so
 
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
elsewhere I haven't gotten that far yet
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
mhm and then instruction means the act
 
01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
teaching instruction means deliberate
 
01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
and strategic approaches to facilitate
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
student learning strategic
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
approaches what the hell is that mean
 
01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:21.719 align:start position:0%
teaching pardon me I don't know it's not
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
teaching deliberate approaches to take
 
01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.510 align:start position:0%
teaching deliberate approaches to take
student

01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
Le it's kind of taking the teaching out
 
01:26:29.199 --> 01:26:33.629 align:start position:0%
Le it's kind of taking the teaching out
of

01:26:33.629 --> 01:26:33.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:33.639 --> 01:26:36.350 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
yeah you see some Master Teachers just
 
01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:42.119 align:start position:0%
doing things and they're able to change
 
01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
gears and move to another level so
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
quickly and be so effective in doing
 
01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:58.709 --> 01:26:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's all about engaging
 
01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:04.280 align:start position:0%
students but yeah
 
01:27:06.750 --> 01:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
this but also this moves it from
 
01:27:09.109 --> 01:27:09.119 align:start position:0%
teaching to facilitating yeah it takes
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
the role of the teacher it's getting rid
 
01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:19.990 align:start position:0%
the role of the teacher it's getting rid
of

01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
teacher say that again that because
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
that's kind of scary well
 
01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
the practice of teaching and strategic
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
approaches to facilitating student
 
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
learning who's doing that it doesn't say
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
it has to be a
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
teacher who is
 
01:27:40.189 --> 01:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
it it's just like I asked out at Warren
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
Village School the school was a school
 
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
of excellence this year I asked the
 
01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
principal Mike how are they delivering
 
01:27:48.669 --> 01:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
Speech Pathology out here it's being
 
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
done online from
 
01:27:54.149 --> 01:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
California so the second grader that's
 
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
trying to learn how to say
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
R is getting that from somebody in
 
01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
California on a screen that's speech
 
01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
therapy who is not a New Englander who
 
01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't know yeah that doesn't
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
understand it's ours natural that's
 
01:28:11.629 --> 01:28:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
facilitator this is what competencies
 
01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:22.280 align:start position:0%
does it ends up you teacher becomes a
 
01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
manager of forms and all this other
 
01:28:27.270 --> 01:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
stuff and you have a parent coming in
 
01:28:28.990 --> 01:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
off the street doing the
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
teaching doing the facilitating yeah
 
01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
facil and you're not getting the same
 
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
quality but I think a teacher has a lot
 
01:28:38.910 --> 01:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
of different kinds of skills and if they
 
01:28:41.470 --> 01:28:41.480 align:start position:0%
can pick up something and work
 
01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
strategically to teach a kid when they
 
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
have the right moment me I don't think
 
01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
why you have to have a different term
 
01:28:51.229 --> 01:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
for it the facilitator I think your
 
01:28:59.430 --> 01:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:14.350 --> 01:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
it I got to go and get some water yeah
 
01:29:16.189 --> 01:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I got to be out of here another
 
01:29:17.709 --> 01:29:17.719 align:start position:0%
half hour
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
four at the beginning me I said I got
 
01:29:33.790 --> 01:29:33.800 align:start position:0%
the page five six I totally frustrated
 
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
and threw it
 
01:29:37.870 --> 01:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
away and I've tried this six or seven
 
01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
different times only on page for yeah
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
yeah see once we got by the definitions
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
though then a lot of stuff's not our
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility unless you're on that
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
rules thing then it is
 
01:29:55.870 --> 01:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
so does our other committee have to meet
 
01:29:59.109 --> 01:29:59.119 align:start position:0%
and look at this too well we're all here
 
01:29:59.119 --> 01:30:03.109 align:start position:0%
and look at this too well we're all here
right

01:30:03.109 --> 01:30:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:13.149 --> 01:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
in I always wonder about the people on
 
01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
jail car who have to read these things
 
01:30:17.229 --> 01:30:17.239 align:start position:0%
and have to pick you know you know who's
 
01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
done all this on on Jael car they're
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
attorneys yeah yeah I know yeah there
 
01:30:24.189 --> 01:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
are four of them that sit there listen
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
to them I'm I'm sit on so I listen to
 
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
them where they describe you know this
 
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
is not clear this is clear something
 
01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the then go back and for I
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
said how do you get to sit down and do
 
01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:36.109 align:start position:0%
said how do you get to sit down and do
those

01:30:36.109 --> 01:30:36.119 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:44.070 align:start position:0%
 
picky

01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
picky
 
01:30:57.550 --> 01:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
instruction means the act of practicing
 
01:31:04.910 --> 01:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
teaching now they changed it to
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
instruction means deliberate and
 
01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
strategic approaches to facilitate
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
that I like that instruction means the
 
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:39.270 align:start position:0%
 
activities

01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
activities
 
01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
okay which one we're going to go through
 
01:31:46.030 --> 01:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.070 --> 01:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
proposal proposed unapproved
 
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
revisions or none of the above where are
 
01:31:58.350 --> 01:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
instruction the actual practice of
 
01:32:05.669 --> 01:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
teaching yeah yes yeah okay okay next
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
one down instructional time means the
 
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
period of time during which instruction
 
01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:13.350 align:start position:0%
period of time during which instruction
is

01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
intuitive yeah you used to have time on
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
task and all that other stuff
 
01:32:27.390 --> 01:32:27.400 align:start position:0%
though you know you might be sitting in
 
01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
the class for instruction 40 minutes but
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
minutes okay although although k k um um
 
01:32:42.030 --> 01:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
in in the current administrative rule I
 
01:32:45.950 --> 01:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
think has a broader definition than
 
01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:47.229 align:start position:0%
think has a broader definition than
instructional

01:32:47.229 --> 01:32:47.239 align:start position:0%
instructional
 
01:32:47.239 --> 01:32:48.950 align:start position:0%
instructional
time

01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:32:51.629 --> 01:32:51.639 align:start position:0%
um during which instruction is offered
 
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
working towards achieving educ outcom
 
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
under the supervision of an educator or
 
01:33:09.109 --> 01:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
member you were back in instructional
 
01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
time again yeah well I thought we said
 
01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
okay means a period of time during which
 
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
instruction is offered who's who's
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
offering the
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
instruction could be a sub to a
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
teacher could be uh the custodian yeah
 
01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that that's in the current
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
term under the supervision of an
 
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
educator or other staff member yeah um
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
and it's during which pupils are
 
01:33:41.470 --> 01:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
actively working towards achieving
 
01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
um so they might be working on a a
 
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
project with a team or something like
 
01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
that under the supervision of a of a
 
01:33:57.070 --> 01:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
teacher and that would still be
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
considered instructional time as opposed
 
01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
U the direct instruction see the first
 
01:34:07.629 --> 01:34:07.639 align:start position:0%
first definition we have in place right
 
01:34:09.870 --> 01:34:09.880 align:start position:0%
now would be applicable to a high school
 
01:34:12.629 --> 01:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
that has a study hall and the kids go
 
01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
for a study hall for 45
 
01:34:16.990 --> 01:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
minutes but there is somebody in the
 
01:34:18.910 --> 01:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
supervising and if have a question you
 
01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
go ask the person now you don't
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
understand this so you're being
 
01:34:23.310 --> 01:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
supervised and you're receiving
 
01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
instruction time
 
01:34:29.470 --> 01:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
MH time now the next one in time which
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
you're actually receiving instruction
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
during which instruction is offered see
 
01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:46.189 --> 01:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:50.189 --> 01:34:50.199 align:start position:0%
yeah okay race that out that's I got a
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
pencil going on down Mastery means a
 
01:34:54.910 --> 01:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
high level of
 
01:34:57.070 --> 01:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
demonstrated I think it's underneath my
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:15.310 --> 01:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
competency and they're removing
 
01:35:19.229 --> 01:35:19.239 align:start position:0%
that because they don't like the word
 
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
Mastery that's what's they're against
 
01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:28.510 align:start position:0%
Mastery that's what's they're against
that

01:35:28.510 --> 01:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:30.109 --> 01:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
you can see the discussion on the next
 
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
page on
 
01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
that and when you go back to the
 
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
definition of competencies it says
 
01:35:37.629 --> 01:35:37.639 align:start position:0%
competency means student learning
 
01:35:39.390 --> 01:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
targets that represent a level of
 
01:35:42.669 --> 01:35:42.679 align:start position:0%
Mastery of key content specific concept
 
01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
skills and knowledge applied within or
 
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
that doesn't explain what Mastery is
 
01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:00.159 align:start position:0%
well they're defining it on the next
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
page means the student performance
 
01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
competency I think this comes underneath
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
our discussion we want to have talk
 
01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
about proficiency competency and Mastery
 
01:36:27.629 --> 01:36:27.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:30.109 --> 01:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
okay okay more
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
discussion um next one learning level
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
means the students identify Readiness to
 
01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
competency the jel car said this seems
 
01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
to be in conflict with the new
 
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
Competency but not with the old one not
 
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
with a statutory
 
01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
definition students identified Readiness
 
01:36:55.629 --> 01:36:55.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:59.470 --> 01:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
competency is that um so this is going
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
back to my time on Schoolboard what was
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
it was there something called proximate
 
01:37:04.159 --> 01:37:08.109 align:start position:0%
it was there something called proximate
zone

01:37:08.109 --> 01:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:11.550 --> 01:37:11.560 align:start position:0%
of I don't know
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
up but it had to do with the
 
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
proxim proxim if we can get through the
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
definitions today I think we got quit
 
01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:32.790 align:start position:0%
definitions today I think we got quit
after

01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
after
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
definitions that means another page
 
01:37:37.470 --> 01:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
other than where we are the zone of
 
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
proximal development is a concept in
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
educational psychology that describes a
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
gap between what a learner can do
 
01:37:44.430 --> 01:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
independently what they can achieve with
 
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
help or with yeah
 
01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:50.830 align:start position:0%
help or with yeah
vosi

01:37:50.830 --> 01:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:21.790 --> 01:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at that Lo level
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
they receive
 
01:38:31.270 --> 01:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
instruction accept instruction absorb
 
01:38:36.629 --> 01:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:39.270 --> 01:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
given I can receive a lot of things that
 
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
this mean that I have
 
01:38:47.629 --> 01:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:50.350 --> 01:38:50.360 align:start position:0%
MH yeah I know when I was in school it
 
01:38:53.669 --> 01:38:53.679 align:start position:0%
all flew over my head
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
ready yeah I think learn I think this
 
01:39:09.629 --> 01:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
part requires more
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
work learning level
 
01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:17.709 align:start position:0%
work learning level
M

01:39:17.709 --> 01:39:17.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
yep and you know for for something
 
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
that's you know with a very short
 
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
definition there if you don't get that
 
01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:26.310 align:start position:0%
definition there if you don't get that
right

01:39:26.310 --> 01:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:39:28.990 --> 01:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that's that maybe the most
 
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:48.510 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that's that maybe the most
important

01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.910 --> 01:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
thing yeah I think that needs a lot of
 
01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:51.990 align:start position:0%
thing yeah I think that needs a lot of
work

01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:39:54.669 --> 01:39:54.679 align:start position:0%
yeah learn opportunities means
 
01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
educational experiences including but
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
if you're on the next page it's F page
 
01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
five on mine
 
01:41:07.149 --> 01:41:07.159 align:start position:0%
but I'm looking at the one that says
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
proficiency means the minimum student
 
01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
performance required to satisfy
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
achievement of ACC
 
01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
compy are you see where where P portion
 
01:41:20.189 --> 01:41:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:28.229 --> 01:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
I think we need to have a discussion on
 
01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
this where people have requested that
 
01:41:33.870 --> 01:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
proficiency be changed to
 
01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:38.550 align:start position:0%
proficiency be changed to
Mastery

01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
but I think compeny proficiency Mastery
 
01:41:46.189 --> 01:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
work the
 
01:41:51.629 --> 01:41:51.639 align:start position:0%
need ex definitions that cannot be
 
01:41:51.639 --> 01:41:54.430 align:start position:0%
need ex definitions that cannot be
confused

01:41:54.430 --> 01:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
confused
 
01:42:00.030 --> 01:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:04.189 --> 01:42:04.199 align:start position:0%
too master should be closer to
 
01:42:06.629 --> 01:42:06.639 align:start position:0%
100 yeah if you want to have Mastery
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
something you want a roofer knows how to
 
01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:19.229 --> 01:42:19.239 align:start position:0%
what rigor means the depth of which the
 
01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
demonstration of complies is measured oh
 
01:42:27.629 --> 01:42:27.639 align:start position:0%
that's already in statutory
 
01:42:39.589 --> 01:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
e2a no I guess is
 
01:42:43.199 --> 01:42:44.870 align:start position:0%
e2a no I guess is
not

01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:52.109 align:start position:0%
not
rhetoric

01:42:52.109 --> 01:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:23.589 --> 01:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:26.669 --> 01:43:26.679 align:start position:0%
under the work study practices that is a
 
01:43:26.679 --> 01:43:28.790 align:start position:0%
under the work study practices that is a
statutory

01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
definition but jelar is saying consider
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
defining these three terms separately
 
01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
using their statutory
 
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
definitions I think their proposed
 
01:43:40.950 --> 01:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
response is work studies practice means
 
01:43:45.629 --> 01:43:45.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:07.149 --> 01:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:08.589 --> 01:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
I think we're getting pretty tired at
 
01:44:11.629 --> 01:44:11.639 align:start position:0%
least I am I think where we got to go
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
next is
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
that there's a section coming up 306.000
 
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:24.270 --> 01:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
requirements I'm kind of shocked that
 
01:44:26.109 --> 01:44:26.119 align:start position:0%
we're now getting into business writing
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
policy on the state
 
01:44:32.950 --> 01:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
level um when we've been doing that
 
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
locally I think we got to be very
 
01:44:36.109 --> 01:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
careful where we're going what's the
 
01:44:38.470 --> 01:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the school
 
01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:40.070 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the school
board

01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
um the other other issues that I you
 
01:44:47.669 --> 01:44:47.679 align:start position:0%
know would like to look at um there's a
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
number of places where they put down and
 
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
listed the areas that make up the
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
substant criteria for an adequate
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
education um on my it's on page
 
01:45:03.310 --> 01:45:03.320 align:start position:0%
11 and they've sliced down and they for
 
01:45:06.189 --> 01:45:06.199 align:start position:0%
example they just say Arts education and
 
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
law says Arts education including music
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
and visual arts they've not put the
 
01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:14.719 align:start position:0%
whole thing down um personal finance
 
01:45:16.510 --> 01:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
literacy is not even
 
01:45:19.589 --> 01:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned um on health education they
 
01:45:21.629 --> 01:45:21.639 align:start position:0%
put health education it's Health and
 
01:45:21.639 --> 01:45:23.470 align:start position:0%
put health education it's Health and
Wellness

01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
Wellness
 
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
um and then they broken out US History
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire history us and New
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire government Civics economics
 
01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
including personal finance world
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
history its social studies including
 
01:45:39.589 --> 01:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
government um so they're they're kind of
 
01:45:47.229 --> 01:45:47.239 align:start position:0%
rewriting a lot of
 
01:45:49.750 --> 01:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
this and I I think we ought to be very
 
01:45:51.390 --> 01:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
careful that because that comes into the
 
01:45:53.070 --> 01:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
domain we're responsible for that's
 
01:45:54.189 --> 01:45:54.199 align:start position:0%
getting into
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
19328 MH and that's our thing they can't
 
01:45:57.360 --> 01:45:59.229 align:start position:0%
19328 MH and that's our thing they can't
change

01:45:59.229 --> 01:45:59.239 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
that without approval well they can't
 
01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
change it it has to be changed by
 
01:46:06.070 --> 01:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
General Court that's the only way it can
 
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
change right
 
01:46:09.870 --> 01:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
now and so they're changing some of this
 
01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
stuff I think those are the things we
 
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
really got to catch and say we got to
 
01:46:16.629 --> 01:46:16.639 align:start position:0%
maintain our statutory definitions and
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
look at the content areas in the subst
 
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
criteria for an adequate education as
 
01:46:28.669 --> 01:46:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:31.709 --> 01:46:31.719 align:start position:0%
you see the the comment here removed
 
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
what and replaced with graduation
 
01:46:38.189 --> 01:46:38.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
83611 so they put it somewhere else but
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know if they put the whole thing
 
01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:47.870 align:start position:0%
I don't know if they put the whole thing
there

01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:51.229 --> 01:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
yeah another catch I caught on page 10
 
01:46:53.229 --> 01:46:53.239 align:start position:0%
they say Wellness as required by section
 
01:47:13.390 --> 01:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:16.990 --> 01:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
MH any other comments for
 
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
today what is the next meeting I don't
 
01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:23.510 align:start position:0%
today what is the next meeting I don't
know

01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
I guess we got to find
 
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
out they have 10 years to renew these
 
01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
things last down 2015 so means 2025 that
 
01:47:36.510 --> 01:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
that's in accordance with what they
 
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
renewed the contract for the third party
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
to right with with with the
 
01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
competency organization um
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
and you know and there's no reason to
 
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
run head you know straight into the wall
 
01:47:53.589 --> 01:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
with with rules that continue need work
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
because they can ex the jail card can
 
01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
extend they can extend and there's
 
01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
probably going to be a lot of changes
 
01:48:01.589 --> 01:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
beyond what we got in front of us
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
yeah somewhere along the way I'd like to
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
have a discussion with them on these
 
01:48:05.199 --> 01:48:05.950 align:start position:0%
have a discussion with them on these
three

01:48:05.950 --> 01:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:48:09.390 --> 01:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
terms compy proficiency where are we
 
01:48:11.629 --> 01:48:11.639 align:start position:0%
going and really get in discussion as
 
01:48:11.639 --> 01:48:12.830 align:start position:0%
going and really get in discussion as
far

01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
far
 
01:48:16.109 --> 01:48:16.119 align:start position:0%
as how deep down in each subject area
 
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to have competency written
 
01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
now who's going to do it what's it going
 
01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
to cost um
 
01:48:24.669 --> 01:48:24.679 align:start position:0%
are we going back to where I can
 
01:48:25.950 --> 01:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
remember there was a program called
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
Fountain Valley and it was a Reading
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
literature program where it listen every
 
01:48:34.030 --> 01:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
skill for reading you could imagine and
 
01:48:35.470 --> 01:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
the teacher had to check that off in
 
01:48:41.350 --> 01:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
every kid in class all day long I was
 
01:48:43.470 --> 01:48:43.480 align:start position:0%
recording and you a good teacher if you
 
01:48:45.070 --> 01:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
were able to get them all
 
01:48:48.669 --> 01:48:48.679 align:start position:0%
recorded not what your teaching so it's
 
01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:50.639 align:start position:0%
you know I don't want to go back there
 
01:48:53.310 --> 01:48:53.320 align:start position:0%
right I think that'd be taking a little
 
01:48:55.589 --> 01:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
bit away from the teachers that we are
 
01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159 align:start position:0%
hopefully coming in with these skills
 
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:04.189 align:start position:0%
 
Hadad

01:49:04.189 --> 01:49:04.199 align:start position:0%
Hadad
 
01:49:07.310 --> 01:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
so so when do you think we ought meet
 
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
again i' not don't want to meet a whole
 
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
lot in the summertime on that stuff no I
 
01:49:15.149 --> 01:49:15.159 align:start position:0%
think it's just P's
 
01:49:17.950 --> 01:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
pool yeah you have a
 
01:49:21.310 --> 01:49:21.320 align:start position:0%
s uh well you don't meet in July right
 
01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
is that sort of a a rule July and August
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
August yeah no meetings July and August
 
01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:31.950 align:start position:0%
August yeah no meetings July and August
yeah

01:49:31.950 --> 01:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
okay that's right that's all okay by me
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
so sometime in September yeah yeah and
 
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
we'll find out where we where they are
 
01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
