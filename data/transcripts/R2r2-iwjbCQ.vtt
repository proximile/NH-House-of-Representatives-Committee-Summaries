committee we we do um I could do that
 
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
after Environmental Services does their
 
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
presentation to the committee if you
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
would like or I can do it now but let's
 
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
let's do it okay so House Bill 384
 
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 align:start position:0%
passed the session uh last session in
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
that bill uh this committee's name was
 
00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 align:start position:0%
changed from capital budget to Capital
 
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
project overview committee and part of
 
00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
the discussion that was involved at that
 
00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 align:start position:0%
time was that there is a number of
 
00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
projects that are occurring outside the
 
00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
capital budget process that are still
 
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
capital projects but they don't there
 
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
was concern that they didn't necessarily
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
have to come before this committee to be
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
updated or reviewed so the uh house
 
00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:04.879 align:start position:0%
finance committee put an amendment in to
 
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
make that change um from budget to
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
projects um a little later on at the end
 
00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
of the meeting well there's a
 
00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:12.879 align:start position:0%

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:17.479 align:start position:0%
agencies on what is meant by a
 
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
project um but that that's a in a
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%

00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
anticipated event of our day

uh thank you thank you Mr chair uh for
 
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
the record Bob Scott commissioner of the
 
00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services to
 
00:10:59.949 --> 00:10:59.959 align:start position:0%
start uh I've asked uh commissioner
 
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
goule uh to sit sit with me thank you
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
for that uh so uh first of all I think
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
you all should have a handout if if you
 
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
don't we have extras here that we can
 
00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
provide you so if anybody needs we can
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
do so uh I I just wanted to give some
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
opening remarks and I I'll have uh
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner Mark Sor and our
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
head head of our land resource
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
management Bureau uh Phil trage uh are
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
going to give the the majority of the
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
presentation uh from the slides but I I
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
want to kind of state the obvious for
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
you all uh the e- permitting automation
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
uh of reporting and monitoring uh data
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
is really important uh for many reasons
 
00:11:43.629 --> 00:11:43.639 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the the chair is a user of our
 
00:11:47.069 --> 00:11:47.079 align:start position:0%
data uh and that's not unique uh we have
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of users of our data uh ranging
 
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
from the public just wants to understand
 
00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
uh Environmental Quality around them to
 
00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:56.959 align:start position:0%
uh practitioners that are so important
 
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
to our economy uh and and the key to
 
00:12:01.949 --> 00:12:01.959 align:start position:0%
moving forward to that is we already
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
have for decades now we've we've kind of
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
clued together uh resources that are
 
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
available online uh that's really
 
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
long-term untenable we needed to to up
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
up the game on that uh and at the same
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
time and so that's why these funds are
 
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
so important to us uh and at the same
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
time obviously those decades worth of
 
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
products that we've been had been
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
producing uh we have people depending on
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
those and we need to Main main those so
 
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's akin to redesigning and
 
00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:33.399 align:start position:0%
rebuilding a car while you're driving it
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
down the road is is what we're trying to
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
do uh we worked very closely with doit
 
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
uh as we should be uh in fact uh we did
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a course correction uh
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
with where we were going with this to
 
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
more better align in talking to Dennis
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
with the longterm where the state's
 
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
going to end up uh to make sure that we
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
don't have any missteps um and with that
 
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
again I just want to reiterate the the
 
00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.509 align:start position:0%
again I just want to reiterate the the
importance

00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
importance
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
the obviously the at this point our our
 
00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:06.519 align:start position:0%
the state the state uh our customers uh
 
00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
expect this type of service and frankly
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh we have increasing demands on our
 
00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
staff and this is the way to make them
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
more efficient so so this is something
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
we're fully bought on to uh and with
 
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
that uh I don't know if any comments uh
 
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
with uh commissioner
 
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
goule uh good morning Mr chair members
 
00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:29.959 align:start position:0%
of the committee um I I have to agree
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
with everything so that's been said so
 
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
far and I want to elaborate a little bit
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
on you know commissioner Scott's course
 
00:13:40.509 --> 00:13:40.519 align:start position:0%
correction comment um so um the history
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
of applications in the state has gone
 
00:13:47.069 --> 00:13:47.079 align:start position:0%
along the same lines of of you know the
 
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
way priv private sector has done you
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
know in the old days everything was
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
written custom and and was maintained by
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
staff um today um the world is pretty
 
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
much bu buying software off the shelf
 
00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
and they're also buying there's the the
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
the type the way you buy software has
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
changed so in the old days you'd buy
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
software you'd license it and then you'd
 
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
pay 15 to 20% maintenance per year and
 
00:14:15.629 --> 00:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
um you wouldd own it for however long
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
and then you might switch it out after
 
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:19.720 align:start position:0%
you know eight years 10 years 20 years
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
however long today it's uh there's it's
 
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
the world has gone towards
 
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
subscription um from a from the
 
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
standpoint of the vendor ERS uh it's a
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
good thing for them and their
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
shareholders because they have this more
 
00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
steady continuous um Revenue stream and
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
so they're more predictable as companies
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
for us it's good and bad um the the good
 
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
part is that we have a predictable cost
 
00:14:47.949 --> 00:14:47.959 align:start position:0%
stream and that we're actually being
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
transparent about what it really costs
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
to operate uh because you know in the
 
00:14:54.509 --> 00:14:54.519 align:start position:0%
old days You' have that huge cost of
 
00:14:55.949 --> 00:14:55.959 align:start position:0%
implementing and then you'd be paying
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
your maintenance now it's kind of more
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
even and you're essentially probably at
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
over say a 10 or 12 year period at about
 
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
the same rate um you know the bad news
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
is it it makes it look like it's more
 
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
expensive right off the bat so that's
 
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
just a financial analysis one of the
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
things that I ask Environmental Services
 
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
to do particularly around um getting the
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh approval for the sweep money was to
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
kind of switch around from you know kind
 
00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:25.959 align:start position:0%
of a focus on the back end of the
 
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
systems um with the anticip ation of
 
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
that being completed and then working to
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
the front end which is affects our
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
customers directly was go the flip that
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
completely around and focus
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
on getting impact positive impact for
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
our constituents on our system sooner
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
sooner than we would have otherwise
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
additionally do that with our standard
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
case management platform which is
 
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
Salesforce now for the state so we we
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
dipped our I I want to say about five
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
years ago we dipped our toe in the water
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
with Salesforce by doing a pilot with
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
the governor's citizen service office
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
they had an old uh it was the very first
 
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
implementation they had an old custom um
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
case management system that they were
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
using for um citizen service we
 
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:17.480 align:start position:0%
implemented Salesforce in an 8-week time
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
period for them so that was you know
 
00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:22.759 align:start position:0%
compared to older implementations that
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
would have taken you know writing custom
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
software you know eight months later
 
00:16:28.269 --> 00:16:28.279 align:start position:0%
you're done 12 months later you're done
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
uh that was extremely fast
 
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
implementation we've since implemented a
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
lot of uh a lot of Salesforce pretty
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
quickly and and that's really our intent
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
for Environmental Services is create a
 
00:16:41.069 --> 00:16:41.079 align:start position:0%
machine we've already got a big part of
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
that machine created and it's moving
 
00:16:46.309 --> 00:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
where we're taking uh and modernizing
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
citizen impact um stuff on the uh
 
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services um digital
 
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
government platform so so what you'll
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
see uh in the in the presentation today
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
is you know where we are on that um and
 
00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
how you know in some ways how the um how
 
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
that shift and focus has impacted what
 
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
we're working
 
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
on thank
 
00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
you so obviously we we' be happy to feel
 
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
questions but I think it may be if you
 
00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:17.959 align:start position:0%
know depending on the committee's
 
00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:19.959 align:start position:0%
desires it may be more instructive again
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
if I can bring assistant commissioner
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
samour and uh administrator uh tro up
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
they could walk through the the slides
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
and then maybe perhaps if it's all right
 
00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
with the chair we could do questions at
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
the end sounds good I just while I have
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
while I have you here commissioner um I
 
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
had a I'm a practitioner I'm I'm on that
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
site all the time uh but we had a um
 
00:17:48.909 --> 00:17:48.919 align:start position:0%
community in molten Boro that had a um a
 
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
community septic system uh that the town
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
didn't really know anything about it
 
00:17:59.149 --> 00:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
there were no records the um the people
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
that are part of that system had very
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
little knowledge of it we had a customer
 
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
that wanted to um reintroduce their
 
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
waste again into it um and I just want
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
to just point out through the archives I
 
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
believe the the lady's name is Melinda
 
00:18:19.149 --> 00:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
town uh did a tremendous job in a couple
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
days coming up with stacks of archived
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
material that no one even knew was out
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
there and it's a great benefit to that
 
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:29.919 align:start position:0%
that whole community the toll so I'm
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
very very excited about what's happening
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
with this and the digitizing and uh
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm very appreciative that
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to have this presentation
 
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that we'll pass on
 
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
the kind words and as you mentioned uh
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
part of it part of our initiatives right
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
now our efforts are to digitize so that
 
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
only not only again does it make those
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
those uh data points available to our
 
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
staff to the industry but also to the
 
00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
public who and as you mentioned the time
 
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
Town people can look online and find
 
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
this type of thing so that's that's a
 
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
great service thank
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
you okay we'll move on to uh the other
 
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:22.230 align:start position:0%
you okay we'll move on to uh the other
two

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
gentlemen morning everyone for the
 
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
record my name is Mark samor I'm the
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner at the New
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
Services and with me is Phil trobridge
 
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
the uh manager of Our Land Resources
 
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
management program so I think everyone
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
has copies of the slide so um if we can
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
go to the uh first slide with content
 
00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:47.799 align:start position:0%
the overview I'll um be just providing a
 
00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
kind of overview of where we're going
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
and the two Commissioners did a great
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
job as always uh teeing it up um as I
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
had mentioned So currently we Dees has
 
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
um two Capital Appropriations that have
 
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
been provided by you all along with uh
 
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
an appropriation from the arpa funding
 
00:20:08.909 --> 00:20:08.919 align:start position:0%
that the governor carved out called
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
sweep um for Our IT modernization
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
projects previously the department um
 
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
had been focusing on existing platforms
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
and the backend work was really where um
 
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
the majority of the work was happening
 
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
um we've refocused that the new focus is
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
on the new platform that um the
 
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner mentioned and working on
 
00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
both the frontend and the backend work
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
another change in Focus has been um
 
00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
going from originally we were going to
 
00:20:44.669 --> 00:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
have a phased approach Department wide
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
working on elements needed for the
 
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
overall it modernization and e-
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
permiting effort um we've uh moved to
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
focusing on
 
00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
lrm um the lrm programs for e permitting
 
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
to uh Implement in at least in the early
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
stages and we'll go over the reasons we
 
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
made that
 
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
choice um the other thing that is a
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
focus is um the uh data s uh our data uh
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
where we're storing our data uh instead
 
00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:21.799 align:start position:0%
of having on premise it um servers we
 
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
are moving to moving to the cloud that
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
is both for security and financial
 
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
reasons it's cheaper and safer for place
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
to store your data so if you can move on
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
to the next slide we're going to I'm
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
going to provide an overview of the
 
00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
projects we're working on that are all
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
part of the overall effort and then I'm
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
going to hand it over to Phil who's
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
going to go into a little more detail um
 
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
again the the reason Phil is here as the
 
00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:50.919 align:start position:0%
lrm manager um he's really taking the
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
lead of in terms of the program side of
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
it um and he's the connection between
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
the program side and the IT staff so if
 
00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
you look at the list eight projects each
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
one of those represents one of the areas
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
we're working on um as already mentioned
 
00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:09.799 align:start position:0%
data warehouse um this dra project is
 
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:12.440 align:start position:0%
about improving data management through
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
it we anticipate increasing the speed of
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
our existing online queries andc
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
increasing Dees data
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
security the online programs for asbest
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
and asset management this project will
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
develop online fors for two important
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
programs the air Resources Division
 
00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:33.559 align:start position:0%
asbest program and the Wastewater
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
engineering Bureau both projects will
 
00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:38.559 align:start position:0%
increase staff productivity and save
 
00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
time for our
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
customers the subsurface bureau's record
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
digitation it was just what we were just
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
talking about Mr chair um this project
 
00:22:51.149 --> 00:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
will scan four million pages of paper
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
septic system and subdivision approvals
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
and make them available um to the staff
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
and public online uh this is one in
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
terms of immediate impact this is this
 
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
alone even if we weren't doing any of
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
the other changes this alone is going to
 
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
have an immediate benefit to both our
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
staff and our um our customers right now
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
these papers are stored in three
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
different locations we have a actual
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
storage bin archives and we have some
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
stored on premise and um finding them is
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
is is what leads to a lot of delays and
 
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
challenges so uh this project alone is
 
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
going to move the ball
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
forward subsurface Bureau designers and
 
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
installers electronic permitting process
 
00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:40.039 align:start position:0%
this project will develop an online
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
process for renewing the LI for septic
 
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
system designers and installers in time
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
2024 renewal
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
year the data check tool project uh the
 
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
natural heritage Bureau data check tool
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
was custom developed by New Hampshire
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
Dees for nhb so that applicant could
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
screen their projects for threatened and
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
endangered species this project will
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
move this tool to the new Statewide
 
00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
Salesforce platform to make it easier
 
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
for nhb to maintain over the long
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
term now um there there's three
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
remaining projects below the last three
 
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
project listed represent where most of
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
the time and funding will be spent so
 
00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
Phil's going to go over these in more
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
detail but I'll just give a quick brief
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
um overview um and then hand it over
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
again the migration the cloud servers
 
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
most re Hampshire uh DS data are stored
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
on servers maintained by doit staff this
 
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
project will move some data to servers
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
in the cloud which are scalable and
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
maintained by vendors again Phil's going
 
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
to cover a little more and the last two
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
boxes are related to our Salesforce e
 
00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
filing most of our effort will be on
 
00:24:56.909 --> 00:24:56.919 align:start position:0%
developing e filing for the land
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
resources management M programs using
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
the new Statewide platform of
 
00:25:06.029 --> 00:25:06.039 align:start position:0%
Salesforce and that is really where the
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
heart of the effort over the next couple
 
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:10.919 align:start position:0%
of years is going to be so with that I'm
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
going to turn it over to Phil so he can
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
go into a little more detail for you
 
00:25:18.029 --> 00:25:18.039 align:start position:0%
all great thank you Mr chair and members
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh so if you could turn
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
to the slide says a migration to Cloud
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
servers so this is one of the big
 
00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:28.039 align:start position:0%
improvements we're seeking to make make
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
is to improve the resiliency of our web
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
services by moving away from owning on
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
premise Hardware to having contracts for
 
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
Cloud Server Services the cloud servers
 
00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
provide better resiliency through
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
redundancy uh which lessens the risk of
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
outages they're also scalable to fit our
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
growing needs which is a great benefit
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
and I'd say most importantly the cloud
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
server cloud servers help us with our
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
productivity uh by freeing up staff time
 
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
from maintaining on premise Hardware and
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
allowing them to work on our priorities
 
00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:02.070 align:start position:0%
allowing them to work on our priorities
for

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
development there's always a lot to
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
learn whenever you do any kind of
 
00:26:07.389 --> 00:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
transition for technology so we're
 
00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:09.919 align:start position:0%
starting with the servers that uh
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
provide the information for my program
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
first and hoping to learn from that as
 
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:16.919 align:start position:0%
we transition the rest of the
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
department so on to the the next slide
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
regarding the Statewide permit
 
00:26:24.269 --> 00:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
portal this is our other big effort and
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
arguably this is the biggest effort uh
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
for the next few years it's putting all
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
the permits permit applications online
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
using the Statewide Salesforce platform
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
the image on this slide just shows the
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
the homepage of the permit platform so
 
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
you can see you know what it's going to
 
00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
look like as as things go
 
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
online we're working with do in
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
Partnership to develop online forms for
 
00:26:49.679 --> 00:26:50.350 align:start position:0%
Partnership to develop online forms for
this

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
portal and we've chosen to work with the
 
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
land resources program my program
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
because that's where the majority of our
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
customer interaction is uh we can we
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
have 118 total forms uh if for and that
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
represents you know four different large
 
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.070 align:start position:0%
represents you know four different large
permitting

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
programs putting these per forms online
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
first is going to have the greatest
 
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
impact for our
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
customers we've been uh in these last
 
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
few months we've been working with doit
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
and Salesforce on this project and
 
00:27:23.389 --> 00:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
during the time we've been setting up
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
the platform for the whole state uh and
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
working on things like online payment
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
online mapping and E signatures and
 
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
we've also done some pilot tests with a
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
few of our forms to get to know the the
 
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
platform and get to know the team at
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
doit you could move to the next slide
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
schedule this slide shows our plan for
 
00:27:51.549 --> 00:27:51.559 align:start position:0%
rolling out the different permit
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
applications on the portal as well as
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
some of the other projects that that
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
Mark mentioned such as the digitization
 
00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.870 align:start position:0%
Mark mentioned such as the digitization
project

00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
it's an aggressive schedule uh going out
 
00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
through 2025 but we believe it is
 
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
achievable we have staffed up to have
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
three project managers to organize our
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
data and to be the interface between the
 
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts on on the inside
 
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
at Dees and the developers at
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
Salesforce and then we've also required
 
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
for our contractors at Salesforce and
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
their and their subcontractors that they
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
have scalable capacity to fit our needs
 
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:27.799 align:start position:0%
so we we'll be able to match up the
 
00:28:29.149 --> 00:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
information we provide with their
 
00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:31.519 align:start position:0%
ability to produce so we can work at a
 
00:28:31.519 --> 00:28:32.750 align:start position:0%
ability to produce so we can work at a
fast

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
fast
 
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
Cadence and so with these uh with these
 
00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:38.919 align:start position:0%
uh the situation we feel like we can
 
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
years on the next
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
slide uh we show at least some of the
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
expected benefits of these it
 
00:28:55.149 --> 00:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
Investments and I'll just take a minute
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
to describe the graph the the the right
 
00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:00.519 align:start position:0%
Axis and the blue line show the number
 
00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
of online forms uh that are going to be
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
available from the department and you
 
00:29:08.909 --> 00:29:08.919 align:start position:0%
can see that starting in 2023 uh we
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
2026 the left axis and the bars on the
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
graph show the number of applications
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
that we expect to be submitted through
 
00:29:23.549 --> 00:29:23.559 align:start position:0%
these online forms and we're starting
 
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:25.240 align:start position:0%
from a little bit higher Baseline here
 
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
because we have a one large eer program
 
00:29:29.509 --> 00:29:29.519 align:start position:0%
already for the subsurface systems
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
Bureau that handles 6,000 applications a
 
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
year uh but even with that higher
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
Baseline we expect to increase the
 
00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:39.919 align:start position:0%
online submittal by 60% over that same
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
time overall by the time we get to 2026
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
we plan to have 75% of all the land
 
00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
resource permits to be done in
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
online and we and I should say that
 
00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:53.919 align:start position:0%
we've prioritized our the ones that
 
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
we're doing first to be the ones that
 
00:29:59.509 --> 00:29:59.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
the ultimate benefit to the customers
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
will be the ability to apply for most
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
Dees online permits or most permits
 
00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:08.519 align:start position:0%
online without needing a printer a stamp
 
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
or a
 
00:30:12.269 --> 00:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
check and for our Dees staff the
 
00:30:13.509 --> 00:30:13.519 align:start position:0%
improvements will make it easier to
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
share the information between staff as
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
we have people working in different
 
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
offices uh and share it digitally uh
 
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
it'll reduce our need for paper
 
00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:24.519 align:start position:0%
storage and it will speed up our
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
fulfillment of right to no
 
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:30.750 align:start position:0%
fulfillment of right to no
requests

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:33.799 align:start position:0%
you turn to um second to last slide on
 
00:30:33.799 --> 00:30:36.149 align:start position:0%
you turn to um second to last slide on
current

00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
status the table on this slide shows how
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
much of the existing Appropriations have
 
00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
either been encumbered or spent which is
 
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
the second column uh or scoped and
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
assigned to a project which is the third
 
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
column and then the the the column on
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
the far right is the sum of those
 
00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
two for the sweep and fy22 23 Capital
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
Appropriations These funds are mostly
 
00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.430 align:start position:0%
Appropriations These funds are mostly
accounted

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
accounted
 
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
for uh for FY 24 and 25
 
00:31:06.909 --> 00:31:06.919 align:start position:0%
appropriation the availability of the
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
sweeps money which as you know must be
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
spent by
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
2026 has slowed our use of these funds
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
and we also just received them uh two
 
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
months ago and our priority has been uh
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
spending down the sweeps and the the
 
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
prior appropriation
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
first so and one thing I want to mention
 
00:31:27.549 --> 00:31:27.559 align:start position:0%
though is that even though we've not
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
encumbered or assigned all of the
 
00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
capital funds we expect to need these
 
00:31:33.629 --> 00:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
full Appropriations and there's a couple
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
of reasons for that um the first is that
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
our initial approach for these online
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
forms has been to keep it very simple to
 
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
get the forms online as quickly as
 
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
possible and that's you know you know a
 
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
software development strategy um but we
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
know that there's going to be a need for
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
a phase two to add more features that
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
customers are going to want and we have
 
00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:58.120 align:start position:0%
not scoped or budgeted that because we
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
don't know what those are and we're
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
going to learn those through engagement
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
with our with our customers and find out
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
what it is they want so we don't
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
overbuild and we focus on what you know
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
satisfies their
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
needs uh similarly uh we have not uh
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
fully scoped the replacement of the
 
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
existing e pering program for the
 
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
subsurface systems Bureau this was a is
 
00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
it was a popular is a popular program it
 
00:32:26.629 --> 00:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
was custombuilt in 2015 it handles uh
 
00:32:26.639 --> 00:32:27.990 align:start position:0%
was custombuilt in 2015 it handles uh
6,00

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
6,00
 
00:32:30.909 --> 00:32:30.919 align:start position:0%
applications already but we need to move
 
00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
it from this custom built platform to
 
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
the Salesforce platform for it's uh to
 
00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
be stable and also to be maintainable in
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
the long run uh this is going to be a
 
00:32:45.149 --> 00:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
big project and we expect it to be uh uh
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
costly and that's why you know we expect
 
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
that to be um it's it we expect to use
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
appropriation and uh before I leave this
 
00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
side let me address a likely question
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
you may have which is you know why are
 
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
there funds um from the FY 2425
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
appropriation assigned to a project when
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
there's still unassigned funds for 22 23
 
00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
uh and the reason for that is that the
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
2425 appropriation had a few specific
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
projects listed with it that were fully
 
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:20.200 align:start position:0%
scoped already and ready to go and we've
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
quickly Mark I'll turn it back to you to
 
00:33:29.789 --> 00:33:29.799 align:start position:0%
summarize yeah thank thanks Phil um a
 
00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:31.720 align:start position:0%
couple points I want to overwatching
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
thoughts I want to leave you with before
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
we move into questions um number one we
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
hope that um the information we provided
 
00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
demonstrates that we are prioritizing
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
our customer needs and leveraging doit
 
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.870 align:start position:0%
our customer needs and leveraging doit
Statewide

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
assets and
 
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
resources um when I also uh you
 
00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.120 align:start position:0%
know feel accurately in um and
 
00:34:00.029 --> 00:34:00.039 align:start position:0%
effectively outlined why we are
 
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
concentrating on lrm I do want the folks
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
to know here though that doesn't mean um
 
00:34:08.829 --> 00:34:08.839 align:start position:0%
we aren't uh we're leaving out the rest
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
of the department um during this time um
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
number one overall from an IT
 
00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
perspective our three priorities of DS
 
00:34:19.869 --> 00:34:19.879 align:start position:0%
right now are is the lrm permitting
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
efforts and the IT modernizations
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
associated with it but our number two
 
00:34:26.589 --> 00:34:26.599 align:start position:0%
priority is maintenance of the Legacy
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
program programs throughout the rest of
 
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
the department those um uh those
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
platforms will continue um to get the um
 
00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:36.839 align:start position:0%
attention they need so the rest of our
 
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
department continues um to meet the
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
needs of our
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
constituents and the third priority is
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
the new development of some non lrm we
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
have received some additional fundings
 
00:34:51.629 --> 00:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
we provided some funding to both air and
 
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:54.599 align:start position:0%
um uh waste divisions um that we were
 
00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:57.640 align:start position:0%
working on so we're possible some new
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
development is happening in the rest of
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
the department um it also should be
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
noted that the work being done right now
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
will benefit those other um programs
 
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
once we move to those it
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
modernization um as we learn more and we
 
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
get better at adapting Salesforce as a
 
00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
platform um improving our uh data
 
00:35:21.069 --> 00:35:21.079 align:start position:0%
storage um and all the efforts that are
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
associated with the
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
modernization um both on the front end
 
00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
and the back end um all the lessons will
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
pay dividends when we go to um
 
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
increasing e permitting and our forms
 
00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:37.400 align:start position:0%
online um when we get to the other
 
00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
programs so uh in closing we are
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
focusing on the project that will make
 
00:35:44.349 --> 00:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
online forms available as quickly as
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
possible and focusing on on lrm simp
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
they represent the majority of New
 
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire de's permitting efforts um but
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
we are ensuring along the way that our
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
customers uh immediate needs are met and
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
that these benef uh these lessons and
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
efforts will benefit all of Dees um down
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
the line with that I think we're ready
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
for your questions certainly questions
 
00:36:14.109 --> 00:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
representative thank you and thank you
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so can you speak
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
to the issues related to privacy and
 
00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
data sec As you move from a platform
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
from your own platform which is totally
 
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
under your control into the outer world
 
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
where many more people have access to
 
00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.990 align:start position:0%
where many more people have access to
your

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
system yeah we're going to bring up the
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
you thanks that's a great question and
 
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
it's one you should be asking um so the
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that's happened in
 
00:36:59.190 --> 00:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
in the IT world is that um particularly
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
for state and local governments is that
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
you know our requirements for security
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
and privacy are are um not only just
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
important but in in many ways they
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
they're uh required to be compliant with
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
our federal funding streams so all of
 
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
the major players in the cloud space
 
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
have created what they call a government
 
00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
Cloud so you have your commercial Cloud
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
so if I was working for say a software
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
company or something and I was running a
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
cloud-based platform like Salesforce I
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
would probably buy the commercial Cloud
 
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
because it's security strong um and I
 
00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
can manage it but I don't have those
 
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
Federal compliance
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
requirements uh they all have a
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
government Cloud that steps up their
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
compliance and their diligence as it
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
relates to data privacy and data
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
security so that um we actually pay a a
 
00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
premium for that service um but it's
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
something we would have to do internally
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
anyway we get audited by um by our
 
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
federal Partners all the time um and of
 
00:38:02.309 --> 00:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
course they audit us um on different
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
standards I wish the the federal
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
government would pick a standard and and
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
and evaluate us on that but but that's
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
not the case today um so we are very
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
good at being audited and so it's really
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
really helpful to have a platform that
 
00:38:20.589 --> 00:38:20.599 align:start position:0%
is uh fedramp compliant now what fedramp
 
00:38:22.109 --> 00:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
means is that there's a third party
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
entity that's evaluated that vendor and
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
and and not only evaluated them one time
 
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
but there's regular compliance checks to
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're maintaining their
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
their um security and privacy um
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
diligence uh there's also another H and
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
and to be fed ramp compliant you
 
00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:42.280 align:start position:0%
actually have to do business with the
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
federal government not all players out
 
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
there do business with the federal
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
government so uh there's also a state
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
ramp compliancy and what that is is it's
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
it's the same amount of discipline but
 
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
it strikes away that Reliance on or the
 
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
requirement that a federal relationship
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
be there so we look for those
 
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
compliances for a smaller vendor who's
 
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
in the space who might not um be able to
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
manage that type of um compliancy we
 
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:13.720 align:start position:0%
have a pretty rigorous um process inside
 
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
our procurement uh so in in we evaluate
 
00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
what our our vendors are doing with
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
respect to security and privacy uh as
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
part of the procurement process it's a
 
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
lot easier to do if there State ramp or
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
fed ramp compl client but if they're not
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
then you know we have that extra level
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
of work that we have to do to um to make
 
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
sure that we're being careful with
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
citizen data uh the other thing we do is
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
particularly on large new system
 
00:39:41.069 --> 00:39:41.079 align:start position:0%
implementations and we've done this uh
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
already once with Salesforce we did it
 
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
as we were getting ready to go live with
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
our vaccination system Vinnie um we
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
actually did a third-party audit said
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
all right you know it's fed Ram
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
compliant should be very secure but did
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
we make any mistakes implementing it so
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's a regular thing that we do uh where
 
00:40:02.109 --> 00:40:02.119 align:start position:0%
we'll do a thirdparty assessment of how
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
we've implemented to make sure that we
 
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
didn't make any configuration mistakes
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
that leave data doors
 
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
open hope that answers the question it's
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
a long answer but there's a lot of work
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
being done our our enemies are targeting
 
00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.910 align:start position:0%
being done our our enemies are targeting
us

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
continuously thank you very much thank
 
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
questions um I want to um I want to
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
thank you uh folks for all coming in
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
today and that presentation we look
 
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
forward to uh as this progresses forward
 
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
um Chris um can maybe you've already
 
00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:40.839 align:start position:0%
done this could you make this a PDF and
 
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
share it with all of the public works if
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
you could please we can do that it's
 
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
it's currently on the website on our
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
website and we'll forward links to the
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
public works okay I I would appreciate
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
that uh for your gentlemen I guess I
 
00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
just have one question and the God
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
forbid this were to happen and all you
 
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
were here with us today is Rainey in
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
charge of the department now if you guys
 
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
are all
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
gone he actually he's at Sil farm so uh
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
he's ready to go over there so yes well
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
we want to thank you for the
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
appropriation so we couldn't be doing
 
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
any of these without the investment
 
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
being made by the legislature so thank
 
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you all right the um
 
00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
if if I could hold you Mr Sor I have a
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
question for you about our other
 
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
commission we're on Sure hold you after
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
and um thank thank you for that and
 
00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
we'll move on to uh Mr Shay so so the
 
00:41:38.589 --> 00:41:38.599 align:start position:0%
last item on your agenda today is under
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous it's
 
00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
23019 um so as I mentioned at the start
 
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee the project n uh the
 
00:41:46.589 --> 00:41:46.599 align:start position:0%
committee name had changed from capital
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
budget to capital
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
projects and prior to that in RSA 17j
 
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:55.480 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
Services is uh required to do a
 
00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
quarterly report on all capital budget
 
00:42:02.349 --> 00:42:02.359 align:start position:0%
projects and that's what's been included
 
00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
that's what you had on um today's packet
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
would be 23- 015 so that's the quarterly
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
report that you receive typically that
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
has been just what's been included in
 
00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
the capital budget those new items from
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
the current capital budget and anything
 
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
that's been carried forward from
 
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
previous Capital budgets by changing the
 
00:42:22.549 --> 00:42:22.559 align:start position:0%
name to capital projects there was a
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
question as to what did that mean what
 
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
needs to be included in the court of the
 
00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:26.910 align:start position:0%
needs to be included in the court of the
report

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
so the item under um tab five 23019 is
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
an effort to um provide some guidance to
 
00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
administrative services on what should
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
be included in the court of the report
 
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
the first number one is to continue to
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
include any Capital uh budget items that
 
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
you've approved through House Bill 25
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
the second would be to include any
 
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
capital projects with an appropriation
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
of a million dollars or
 
00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:55.079 align:start position:0%
more the third would be to include um
 
00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:57.880 align:start position:0%
any Capital project that the oplc funds
 
00:43:00.349 --> 00:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
through its dedicated fund so
 
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
legislation this year was adopted to
 
00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
allow that group to use their dedicated
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
fund for capital projects and you'll see
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of the page I referenced
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
the RSA there and then the last point
 
00:43:14.549 --> 00:43:14.559 align:start position:0%
was to um include any other projects
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
that committee members might bring up
 
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
that they believe should be tracked by
 
00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:18.670 align:start position:0%
that they believe should be tracked by
this

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
group so it I had reached out to the
 
00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
chair as well as representative eel who
 
00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
was involved with some of this um some
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
of these changes during the house
 
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
finance phase um to see if this was kind
 
00:43:31.549 --> 00:43:31.559 align:start position:0%
of getting to the place where they
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
thought they should be with this and uh
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
so this is why you have this Draft
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
before you and if the committee agrees
 
00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:38.559 align:start position:0%
to it if you could give us an
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
affirmative vote to say that this is the
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
policy you want to be used we'll share
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
it with the state agencies so they know
 
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
what to have included qu questions first
 
00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
for uh Mr Shay about
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%

online

00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%

should be included in this packet uh the
 
00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
the coure of the report if they have
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
capital budget and it's considered a
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
capital project that that's got over a
 
00:44:22.319 --> 00:44:24.589 align:start position:0%
capital project that that's got over a
million

00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:44:27.069 --> 00:44:27.079 align:start position:0%
dollars further
 
00:44:27.079 --> 00:44:28.309 align:start position:0%
dollars further

00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
repr um well thank you very much Mr
 
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
chair uh as the chair and representative
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
clud you know I was a long-term member
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
of Public Works and highways and then
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
when IED long well I don't know about
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
esteemed but um so um it had given I
 
00:44:46.549 --> 00:44:46.559 align:start position:0%
would say a lot of us a little bit of
 
00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
heartburn when there were capital
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
projects that weren't sort of going
 
00:44:53.309 --> 00:44:53.319 align:start position:0%
through the regular capital budget uh
 
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
review process because they were going
 
00:44:57.309 --> 00:44:57.319 align:start position:0%
through through Finance because they
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
were coming through um that source of
 
00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:02.559 align:start position:0%
funding as opposed to a capital budget
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
so um in the discussion of the
 
00:45:07.549 --> 00:45:07.559 align:start position:0%
construction of the legislative parking
 
00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
garage there was another situation that
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
was arising that involved you know
 
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight and so in the
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
process of that discussion uh we saw or
 
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
I in particular saw an opportunity to um
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
bring capital projects that weren't
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise in the capital budget uh
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
process into some sort of review process
 
00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
that I felt and and you know everybody
 
00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:39.079 align:start position:0%
supported it uh deserved an equal amount
 
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
of oversight and they weren't getting it
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
just because they were in coming through
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
um the regular operating budget so
 
00:45:50.589 --> 00:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
that's where uh that was the Genesis of
 
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
all of that and that's how we Chang the
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
name uh to Capital project overview view
 
00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
but then Chris was kind enough to point
 
00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
out that that sort of left this never
 
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
Neverland um of what how many of
 
00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:07.640 align:start position:0%
projects that were being paid for with
 
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
capital funds should be um reviewed by
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
the group and representative makoni and
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
I chatted about it and we felt like a
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars was a good um good level
 
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
so at some point if you want a motion to
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
motion motion motion has been
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
made um and seconded
 
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none if you're in
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
favor of the motion which is the
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
guidelines outlined under
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
23019 um signified by saying I I any
 
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
opposed thank you all for that motion
 
00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.549 align:start position:0%
opposed thank you all for that motion
carries

00:47:02.549 --> 00:47:02.559 align:start position:0%
carries
 
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
unanimous the I believe the last item
 
00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
and last item is our next meeting and uh
 
00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
looks like it'll be December
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
15th and the time of this meeting would
 
00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
o'clock if that is an issue for the
 
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
members uh please let Chris or myself
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
know about
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
that yes um an agenda item for that
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
meeting I would like to see fishing game
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
come in um there was several legislators
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
that expressed disappointment in their
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
progress on their computer upgrades and
 
00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
there is a special provision in House
 
00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 uh that talks to what they are
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing so uh since it
 
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
would be a project I would like to see
 
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
them on the agenda to come in and EXP
 
00:47:58.109 --> 00:47:58.119 align:start position:0%
explain to us what their plan of action
 
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
and Milestones are and how they have uh
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh progressed on those since the one
 
00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
that was presented to us at the time of
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
the budget thank you Senator without
 
00:48:13.549 --> 00:48:13.559 align:start position:0%
objection one moment M question so these
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
meetings are generally sounds like you
 
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
guys have them on the third Friday of
 
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
the month I think Senator gray might
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
have the same concern I have that's also
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
I believe when fiscal generally meets at
 
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
10:00 if I have that correct will the
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
9:00 at 10:00 be
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
done the anticipation is that um this
 
00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
meeting would be done in time for fiscal
 
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
um this meeting you just had and the
